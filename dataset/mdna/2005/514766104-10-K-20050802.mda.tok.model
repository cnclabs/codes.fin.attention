to remain focused on its core businesses  in october  the company sold dock resins corporation dock resins  its specialty chemical subsidiary 
the company made the decision to sell dock resins in order to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt and other liabilities 
as a result of the sale of dock resins  the financial results of dock resins have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all applicable years 
unless otherwise specified  the information and descriptions provided in this report relate only to the continuing operations of the company 
in june  the company sold assets associated with its former domestic commodity vegetable business in order to focus on apio s growing value added specialty packaging and export businesses 

table of contents the company s core polymer products are based on its patented proprietary intelimer polymers  which differ from other polymers in that they can be customized to abruptly change their physical characteristics when heated or cooled through a pre set temperature switch 
for instance  intelimer polymers can change within the range of one or two degrees celsius from a non adhesive state to a highly tacky  adhesive state  from an impermeable state to a highly permeable state  or from a solid state to a viscous liquid state 
these abrupt changes are repeatedly reversible and can be tailored by landec to occur at specific temperatures  thereby offering substantial competitive advantages in the company s target markets 
the company was incorporated in california on october  the company completed its initial public offering in and is listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol lndc 
technology overview polymers are important and versatile materials found in many of the products of modern life 
certain polymers  such as cellulose and natural rubber  occur in nature 
man made polymers include nylon fibers used in carpeting and clothing  coatings used in paints and finishes  plastics such as polyethylene  and elastomers used in automobile tires and latex gloves 
historically  synthetic polymers have been designed and developed primarily for improved mechanical and thermal properties  such as strength and the ability to withstand high temperatures 
improvements in these and other properties and the ease of manufacturing of synthetic polymers have allowed these materials to replace wood  metal and natural fibers in many applications over the last years 
more recently  scientists have focused their efforts on identifying and developing sophisticated polymers with novel properties for a variety of commercial applications 
landec s intelimer polymers are a proprietary class of synthetic polymeric materials that respond to temperature changes in a controllable  predictable way 
typically  polymers gradually change in adhesion  permeability and viscosity over broad temperature ranges 
landec s intelimer materials  in contrast  can be designed to exhibit abrupt changes in permeability  adhesion and or viscosity over temperature ranges as narrow as c to c 
these changes can be designed to occur at relatively low temperatures c to c that are relatively easy to maintain in industrial and commercial environments 
figure illustrates the effect of temperature on intelimer materials as compared to typical polymers 
temperature graph landec s proprietary polymer technology is based on the structure and phase behavior of intelimer materials 
the abrupt thermal transitions of specific intelimer materials are achieved through the controlled use of hydrocarbon side chains that are attached to a polymer backbone 
below a pre determined switch temperature  the polymer s side chains align through weak hydrophobic interactions resulting in a crystalline structure 
when this side chain crystallizable polymer is heated to  or above  this switch temperature  these 
table of contents interactions are disrupted and the polymer is transformed into an amorphous  viscous state 
because this transformation involves a physical and not a chemical change  this process is repeatedly reversible 
landec can set the polymer switch temperature anywhere between c to c by varying the length of the side chains 
the reversible transitions between crystalline and amorphous states are illustrated in figure below 
temperature graph side chain crystallizable polymers were first discovered by academic researchers in the mid s 
these polymers were initially considered to be merely of scientific curiosity from a polymer physics perspective  and  to the company s knowledge  no significant commercial applications were pursued 
in the mid s  dr 
ray stewart  the company s founder  became interested in the idea of using the temperature activated permeability properties of these polymers to deliver various materials such as drugs and pesticides 
after forming landec in  dr 
stewart subsequently discovered broader utility for these polymers 
after several years of basic research  commercial development efforts began in the early s  resulting in initial products in mid landec s intelimer materials are generally synthesized from long side chain acrylic monomers that are derived primarily from natural materials such as coconut and palm oils  that are highly purified and designed to be manufactured economically through known synthetic processes 
these acrylic monomer raw materials are then polymerized by landec leading to many different side chain crystallizable polymers whose properties vary depending upon the initial materials and the synthetic process 
intelimer materials can be made into many different forms  including films  coatings  microcapsules and discrete forms 
description of core business the company participates in two core business segments food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
in addition to these two core segments  landec will license technology and conduct ongoing research and development and supply materials through its technology licensing research and development business 

table of contents organization structure food products technology business the company began marketing  in early fiscal year  its proprietary intelimer based breatheway tm breathable membranes for use in the fresh cut produce packaging market  one of the fastest growing segments in the produce industry 
landec s proprietary breatheway packaging technology when combined with produce that is processed by washing and in some cases cut and mixed  results in packaged produce with increased shelf life  reduced shrink waste and without the need for ice during the distribution cycle 
this is referred to as value added products 
in december  the company acquired apio  its then largest customer in the food products technology business and one of the nation s leading marketers and packers of produce and specialty packaged fresh cut vegetables 
apio provides year round access to specialty packaged produce products  utilizes state of the art fresh cut produce processing technology and distributes to the top us retail grocery chains  major club stores and to the foodservice industry 
the company s proprietary breatheway packaging business has been combined with apio into a wholly owned subsidiary that retains the apio  inc name 
this vertical integration within the food products technology business gives landec direct access to the large and growing fresh cut and whole produce market 
the technology and market opportunity proprietary intelimer packaging technology certain types of fresh cut and whole produce can spoil or discolor rapidly when packaged in conventional packaging materials and are therefore limited in their ability to be distributed broadly to markets 
the company s proprietary breatheway packaging technology extends the shelf life and quality of fresh cut and whole produce 
fresh cut produce is pre washed  cut and packaged in a form that is ready to use by the consumer and is thus typically sold at premium price levels compared to unpackaged produce 
according to the international fresh cut produce association ifpa  in  the total us fresh produce market was estimated to be between to billion 
of this  us retail sales of fresh cut produce were estimated to comprise of the fresh produce market 
the company believes that the growth of this market has been driven by consumer demand and the willingness to pay for convenience  freshness  uniform quality  safety and nutritious produce delivered to the point of sale 
according to the ifpa  the fresh cut produce market is one of the highest growth areas in retail grocery stores 
and according to the produce marketing association the fresh cut produce category is growing at double digit rates while total produce is only growing at to per year 
although fresh cut produce companies have had success in the salad market  the industry has been slow to diversify into other fresh cut vegetables or fruits due primarily to limitations in film and plastic tray materials used to package fresh cut produce 
after harvesting  vegetables and fruit continue to respire  consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide 
too much or too little oxygen can result in premature spoilage and decay and  in some cases  promote the growth of microorganisms that jeopardize inherent food safety 
conventional packaging films used today  such as polyethylene and polypropylene  can be made with modest permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide  but often do not provide the optimal atmosphere for the 
table of contents produce packaged 
shortcomings of conventional packaging materials have not significantly hindered the growth in the fresh cut salad market because lettuce  unlike many vegetables and fruit  has low respiration requirements 
the respiration rate of produce varies from vegetable to vegetable and from fruit to fruit 
the challenge facing the industry is to develop packaging for the high respiring  high value and shelf life sensitive vegetable and fruit markets 
the company believes that today s conventional packaging films face numerous challenges in adapting to meet the diversification of pre cut vegetables and fruit evolving in the industry without compromising shelf life and produce quality 
to mirror the growth experienced in the fresh cut salad market  the markets for high respiring vegetables and fruit such as broccoli  cauliflower  asparagus  papayas  bananas and berries will require a more versatile and sophisticated packaging solution for which the company s breatheway packaging technology was developed 
the respiration rate of produce also varies with temperature 
as temperature increases  produce generally respires at a higher rate  which speeds up the aging process  resulting in shortened shelf life and increased potential for decay  spoilage  and loss of texture and dehydration 
as produce is transported from the processing plant through the refrigerated distribution chain to foodservice locations  retail grocery stores and club stores  and finally to the ultimate consumer  temperatures can fluctuate significantly 
therefore  temperature control is a constant challenge in preserving the quality of fresh cut and whole produce a challenge few current packaging films can fulfill 
the company believes that its temperature responsive breatheway packaging technology is well suited to the challenges of the produce distribution process 
using its intelimer polymer technology  landec has developed packaging technology that it believes addresses many of the shortcomings of conventional packaging materials 
a membrane is applied over a small cutout section or an aperture of a flexible film bag or plastic tray 
this highly permeable window acts as the mechanism to provide the majority of the gas transmission requirements for the entire package 
these membranes are designed to provide three principal benefits high permeability 
landec s breatheway packaging technology is designed to permit transmission of oxygen and carbon dioxide at times the rate of conventional packaging films 
the company believes that these higher permeability levels will facilitate the packaging diversity required to market many types of fresh cut and whole produce 
ability to adjust oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability 
breatheway packaging can be tailored with carbon dioxide to oxygen transfer ratios ranging from to and selectively transmit oxygen and carbon dioxide at optimum rates to sustain the quality and shelf life of packaged produce 
temperature responsiveness 
landec has developed breathable membranes that can be designed to increase or decrease permeability in response to environmental temperature changes 
the company has developed packaging that responds to higher oxygen requirements at elevated temperatures but is also reversible  and returns to its original state as temperatures decline 
the temperature responsiveness of these membranes allows ice to be removed from the distribution system which results in numerous benefits 
these benefits include a substantial decrease in freight cost  reduced risk of contaminated produce because ice can be a carrier of micro organisms  the elimination of expensive waxed cartons that cannot be recycled  and the potential decrease in work related accidents due to melted ice 
landec believes that growth of the overall produce market will be driven by the increasing demand for the convenience of fresh cut produce 
this demand will in turn require packaging that facilitates the quality and shelf life of produce transported to fresh cut distributors in bulk and pallet quantities 
the company believes that in the future its breatheway packaging technology will be useful for packaging a diverse variety of fresh cut and whole produce products 
potential opportunities for using landec s technology outside of the produce market exist in cut flowers and in other food products 
landec is working with leaders in the club store  retail grocery chain and foodservice markets 
the company believes it will have growth opportunities for the next several years through new customers and 
table of contents products in the united states  expansion of its existing customer relationships  and through export and shipments of specialty packaged produce 
landec manufactures its breatheway packaging through selected qualified contract manufacturers and markets and sells breatheway packaging directly to food distributors 
the business apio  inc apio had revenues of approximately million for the fiscal year ended may   million for the fiscal year ended may   million for the seven months ended may  and million for the fiscal year ended october  based in guadalupe  california  apio  when acquired in december  consisted of two major businesses first  the fee for service selling and marketing of whole produce and second  the specialty packaged fresh cut and whole value added processed products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary breatheway packaging 
the fee for service business historically included field harvesting and packing  cooling and marketing of vegetables and fruit on a contract basis for growers in california s santa maria  san joaquin and imperial valleys as well as in arizona and mexico 
the company exited this business and certain assets associated with the business were sold in june to apio fresh  llc apio fresh 
apio fresh is owned by a group of entities and persons that supply produce to apio  including nicholas tompkins  apio s president and chief executive officer 
under the terms of the sale  apio fresh purchased certain equipment and carton inventory from apio in exchange for approximately  in connection with the sale  apio fresh will pay apio an on going royalty fee per carton sold for the use of apio s brand names and apio fresh and its owner growers entered into a long term supply agreement with apio to supply produce to apio for its fresh cut value added business 
the fresh cut value added processed products business  developed within the last nine years  markets a variety of fresh cut and whole vegetables to the top retail grocery chains and club stores 
during the fiscal year ended may   apio shipped more than sixteen million cartons of produce to leading supermarket retailers  wholesalers  foodservice suppliers and club stores throughout the united states and internationally  primarily in asia 
there are five major distinguishing characteristics of apio that provide competitive advantages in the food products technology market value added supplier apio has structured its business as a marketer and seller of fresh cut and whole value added produce 
it is focused on developing its eat smart brand and the dole brand for all of its fresh cut and whole value added products 
as retail grocery and club store chains consolidate  apio is well positioned as a single source of a broad range of products 
reduced farming risks apio reduces its farming risk by not taking ownership of farmland  and instead  contracts with growers for produce 
the year round sourcing of produce is a key component to the fresh cut and whole value added processing business 
lower cost structure apio has strategically invested in the rapidly growing fresh cut and whole value added business 
apio s  square foot value added processing plant is automated with state of the art vegetable processing equipment 
virtually all of apio s value added products utilize landec s proprietary breatheway packaging technology 
apio s strategy is to operate one large central processing facility in one of california s largest  lowest cost growing regions santa maria valley and use packaging technology to allow for the nationwide delivery of fresh produce products 
export capability apio is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growth in export sales to asia and europe over the next decade with its export business  calex 
through calex  apio is currently one of the largest us exporters of broccoli to asia and is selling its iceless products to asia using proprietary breatheway packaging technology 
expanded product line using technology apio  through the use of its breatheway packaging technology  is introducing on average twelve new value added products each year 
these new product 
table of contents offerings range from various sizes of fresh cut bagged products  to vegetable trays  to whole produce  to a meal line of products 
during the last twelve months  apio has introduced new products 
for the past nine years  the company has marketed its eat smart fresh cut bagged vegetables  trays and iceless products using its breatheway packaging technology and has now expanded its technology to include packaging for bananas 
in september  apio entered into an agreement with chiquita where apio will supply chiquita with its proprietary banana packaging technology on a worldwide basis for the ripening  conservation and shelf life extension of bananas in selective applications on an exclusive basis and for other applications on a non exclusive basis 
in addition  apio will provide chiquita with ongoing research and development  process technology support for the breatheway membranes and bags  and technical service support throughout the customer chain in order to assist in the development and market acceptance of the technology 
for its part  chiquita provides marketing  distribution and retail sales support for chiquita bananas sold worldwide in breatheway packaging 
to maintain the exclusive license  chiquita must meet annual minimum purchase thresholds of breatheway banana packages 
the initial market focus for the breatheway banana packaging technology using chiquita brand bananas will be commercial outlets that normally do not sell bananas because of their short shelf life outlets such as quick serve restaurants  convenience stores  drug stores and food service outlets 
in addition to the introduction of specialty packaging for bananas  the company is selling its breatheway packaging technology for case liner packaging for bunch and crown broccoli  eighteen pound cases of loose broccoli florets  asian cut broccoli crowns and export cut broccoli crowns 
the company s specialty packaging for case liner products reduces freight expense up to by eliminating the weight and space consumed by ice 
in addition to reducing the cost of freight  the removal of ice from the distribution system offers additional benefits 
the company s new packaging system can decrease the potential for work related accidents due to melted ice  eliminate the risk of ice as a carrier of microorganisms that could potentially contaminate produce and eliminate the need for expensive waxed cartons that cannot be recycled 
product enhancements in the fresh cut vegetable line include fresh cut vegetable trays designed to look like they were freshly made in the retail grocery store 
the rectangular tray design is convenient for storage in consumers refrigerators and expands the company s wide ranging vegetable tray line 
in june  the company commercially launched its new petite fresh cut vegetable tray for retail and its new retail mini tray 
also in june  the company entered into an exclusive packaging and marketing agreement with dole fresh vegetables  inc for apio to sell and distribute a line of fresh cut produce under the dole brand in the united states and canada 
in fiscal year  sales of the value added vegetable tray line grew  and according to ac nielsen  for the three months ended march   the company s market share for sales of vegetable trays to retail grocery stores in the us was 
agricultural seed technology business landec ag s strategy is to build a vertically integrated seed technology company based on the proprietary intellicoat seed coating technology and its direct marketing and consultative selling capabilities 
the technology and market opportunity intellicoat seed coatings landec has developed and  through landec ag  is commercially selling its intellicoat seed coatings  an intelimer based agricultural material designed to control seed germination timing  increase crop yields and extend crop planting windows 
these coatings are being applied to corn and soybean seeds 
according to the us agricultural statistics board  the total planted acreage in in the united states for corn and soybean seed exceeded million and million  respectively 

table of contents in fiscal year  landec ag successfully launched its first commercial product  pollinator plus coatings for inbred corn seed 
landec ag expanded its sales of inbred corn seed coating products in fiscal year to regional and national seed companies in the united states 
this application is targeted to approximately  acres in ten states and is now being used by seed companies in the united states 
early plant corn  perhaps landec ag s largest seed coating opportunity  allows the farmer to plant corn seed to weeks earlier than typically possible due to cold soil temperatures 
by allowing the farmer to plant earlier than normal  early plant hybrid corn enables large farmers to utilize staff and equipment more efficiently and provide flexibility during the critical planting period 
our relay tm cropping system of wheat and intellicoat coated soybean allows farmers to plant and harvest two crops during the year on the same land  providing significant financial benefit for the farmer 
currently  farmers must work within a narrow window of time to plant seeds 
if the seeds are planted too early  they may rot or suffer chilling injury due to the absorption of water at cold soil temperatures below which germination occurs 
if they are planted too late  the growing season may end prior to the crop reaching full maturity 
in either case  the resulting crop yields are sub optimal 
moreover  the planting window can be fairly brief  requiring the farmer to focus almost exclusively on planting during this time 
seeds also germinate at different times due to variations in absorption of water  thus providing for variations in the growth rate of the crops 
the company s intellicoat seed coating prevents planted seeds from absorbing water when the ground temperature is below the coating s pre set temperature switch 
intellicoat seed coatings are designed to enable coated seeds to be planted early without risk of chilling damage caused by the absorption of water at cold soil temperatures 
as spring advances and soil temperatures rise to the pre determined switch temperature close to where seed germination normally occurs  the polymer s permeability increases and the coated seeds absorb water and begin to germinate 
the company believes that intellicoat seed coatings provide the following advantages a longer planting window  avoidance of chilling injury  more uniform germination and better utilization of equipment and labor 
as a result  the company believes that intellicoat seed coatings offer the potential for improvements in crop yields and net income to the farmer 
the business landec ag landec ag had sales of approximately million for the fiscal year ended may   million for the fiscal year ended may   million for the seven months ended may  and million for the fiscal year ended october  based in monticello  indiana  landec ag sells a comprehensive line of hybrid seed corn to more than  farmers in over forty states through direct marketing programs 
the success of landec ag comes  in part  from its expertise in selling directly to the farmer  bypassing the traditional and costly farmer dealer system 
the company believes that this direct channel of distribution provides up to a cost advantage to its customers 
in order to support its direct marketing programs  landec ag has developed a proprietary direct marketing  and consultative selling information technology that enables state of the art methods for communicating with a broad array of farmers 
this proprietary direct marketing information technology includes a current database of over  farmers 
the acquisition of fielder s choice in by landec ag was strategic in providing a cost effective vehicle for marketing intellicoat seed coating products 
the company believes that the combination of coating technology and a direct channel of distribution  telephonic and electronic commerce capabilities will enable landec ag to more quickly achieve meaningful market penetration 
technology licensing research and development businesses the company believes its technology has commercial potential in a wide range of industrial  consumer and medical applications beyond those identified in its core businesses 
for example  landec s core patented intelimer materials technology  can be used to trigger release of small molecule drugs  catalysts  pesticides or 
table of contents fragrances just by changing the temperature of the intelimer materials or to activate adhesives through controlled temperature change 
in order to exploit these opportunities  the company has entered into and will enter into licensing and collaborative corporate agreements for product development and or distribution in certain fields 
however  given the infrequency and unpredictability of when the company may enter into any such licensing and research and development arrangements  the company is unable to disclose its financial expectations in advance of entering into such arrangements 
industrial materials and adhesives landec s industrial product development strategy is to focus on coatings  catalysts  resins  additives and adhesives in the polymer materials market 
during the product development stage  the company identifies corporate partners to support the ongoing development and testing of these products  with the ultimate goal of licensing the applications at the appropriate time 
intelimer polymer systems 
landec has developed latent catalysts useful in extending pot life  extending shelf life  reducing waste and improving thermoset cure methods 
some of these latent catalysts are currently being distributed by akzo nobel chemicals bv the company has also developed intelimer polymer materials useful in enhancing the formulating options for various personal care products 
landec s pressure sensitive adhesives psa technology is currently being evaluated in a variety of industrial and medical applications where strong adhesion to a substrate ie steel  glass  silicon  skin  etc 
is desired for a defined time period and upon thermal triggering  results in a significant peel strength reduction 
for example  select psa systems exhibit greater than reduction in peel strength upon warming  making them ideal for applications on fragile substrates 
ucb chemicals corporation 
on april   the company entered into a research and development agreement with ucb chemicals corporation ucb  an operating entity of cytec  inc  a major pharmaceutical and chemical company located in belgium 
ucb s chemical business is a major supplier of radiation curing and powder coating resins 
under this agreement  the company explored polymer systems for evaluation in several industrial product applications 
based on the success of this initial research and development collaboration  in december  the company entered into a million license and research and development agreement with ucb 
this agreement had a term of one year through december and was for the exclusive rights to use the company s intelimer materials technology in the fields of powder coatings worldwide and pressure sensitive adhesives worldwide  except asia 
personal care and cosmetic applications landec s personal care and cosmetic applications strategy is focused on supplying intelimer materials to industry leaders for use in lotions and creams  and potentially color cosmetics  lipsticks and hair care 
the company is currently shipping products to l oreal of paris for use in lotions and creams 
to date  sales of landec materials used in l oreal products have not been material to the company s financial results and given the company s limited history with l oreal  the company is unable to predict future revenues for this product or for any other products sold by l oreal that may contain landec materials 
medical applications port tm ophthalmic devices 
landec developed the port punctal occluder for the retention of tears ophthalmic device initially to address a common  yet poorly diagnosed condition known as dry eye that is estimated to affect million americans annually 
the device consists of a physician applied applicator containing solid intelimer material that transforms into a flowable  viscous state when heated slightly above body temperature 
after inserting the intelimer material into the lacrimal drainage duct  it quickly solidifies into a form fitting  solid plug 
occlusion of the lacrimal drainage duct allows the patient to retain tear fluid and thereby provides relief and therapy to the dry eye patient 
the port device was approved by the fda during fiscal year to date  alcon has not commercialized and may choose not to commercialize the port device and  therefore the company may not receive royalties on any future sales 

table of contents in december  landec licensed the rights to worldwide manufacturing  marketing and distribution of its port ophthalmic device to alcon 
under the terms of the transaction  landec received an up front cash payment of  a  milestone payment in november  and research and development funding and landec will receive ongoing royalties of on product sales of each port device through any fees paid to the company are non refundable 
landec will continue to provide development support on a contract basis through product launch 
landec also provides the intelimer polymer to alcon which is used in the port device 
medical device 
on april   landec entered into an exclusive licensing and one year research and development collaboration with a large medical device company 
upfront payments totaled  with total potential payments of up to million based on certain milestones being met 
in addition  royalties of will be paid on future product sales 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the collaboration with the medical device company and the timing or amount of revenues  if any 
discontinued operations dock resins 
in april  the company acquired dock resins  a privately held manufacturer and marketer of specialty acrylic and other polymers based in linden  new jersey 
dock resins supplied proprietary polymers including acrylic  methacrylic  alkyd  polyester  urethane and polyamide polymers to film converters engaged in hot stamping  decorative wood grain  automotive interiors  holograms  and metal foil applications 
dock resins also supplied products to a number of other markets  such as  graphic arts  automotive refinishing  construction  pressure sensitive adhesives  paper coatings  caulks  concrete curing compounds and sealers 
in october  the company sold dock resins for million million net of debt not assumed and before expenses in order to strengthen its balance sheet and focus management s attention on our core food and agricultural technology businesses 
the company recorded a loss on the sale of million  of which million was recorded in fiscal year and million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year upon the close of the sale 
as a result of the sale of dock resins  the financial results of dock resins have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all applicable periods 
unless otherwise specified  the information and descriptions provided in this report relate only to the continuing operations of the company 
sales and marketing each of the company s core businesses are supported by dedicated sales and marketing resources 
the company intends to develop its internal sales capacity as more products progress toward commercialization and as business volume expands geographically 
during fiscal year  sales to the company s top five customers accounted for approximately of its revenues  with the top customer  costco wholesale corp  accounting for approximately of the company s revenues 
food products technology business apio has sales people  located in central california and throughout the us  supporting the export business and the specialty packaged value added produce business 
agricultural seed technology business landec ag utilizes seed sales consultants and associates located in monticello  indiana for its direct marketing of fielders choice direct seed corn and intellicoat coated products 
customer contacts are made based on direct responses and inquiries from customers 

table of contents manufacturing and processing landec intends to control the manufacturing of its own products whenever possible  as it believes that there is considerable manufacturing margin opportunity in its products 
in addition  the company believes that know how and trade secrets can be better maintained by landec retaining manufacturing capability in house 
food products technology business the manufacturing process for the company s proprietary breatheway packaging products is comprised of polymer manufacturing  membrane manufacturing and label package conversion 
dock resins currently manufactures virtually all of the polymers for the breatheway packaging 
select outside contractors currently manufacture the breathable membranes and landec has transitioned virtually all of the label package conversion to apio s guadalupe facility to meet the increasing product demand and to provide additional developmental capabilities 
apio processes all of its fresh cut value added products in its state of the art processing facility located in guadalupe  california 
cooling of produce is done through third parties and apio cooling  a separate company in which apio has a ownership interest and is the general partner 
agricultural seed technology business the company performs its batch coating operations in a leased facility in oxford  indiana 
this facility is being used to coat other seed companies inbred seed corn with the company s pollinator plus seed corn coatings 
the company has a pilot manufacturing facility in indiana to support the commercialization of its early plant corn and for its relay cropping system for wheat coated soybean products 
this facility utilizes a continuous coating process that has increased seed coating capabilities by tenfold compared to the previous system using batch coaters 
landec ag contracts for production of its hybrid seed corn from established seed producers 
general many of the raw materials used in manufacturing certain of the company s products are currently purchased from a single source  including certain monomers used to synthesize intelimer polymers and substrate materials for the company s breathable membranes 
in addition  a large majority of the hybrid corn varieties sold by landec ag are sourced from a single seed producer 
upon manufacturing scale up of seed coating operations and as hybrid corn sales increase  the company may enter into alternative supply arrangements 
although to date the company has not experienced difficulty acquiring materials for the manufacture of its products nor has landec ag experienced difficulty in acquiring hybrid corn varieties  no assurance can be given that interruptions in supplies will not occur in the future  that the company will be able to obtain substitute vendors  or that the company will be able to procure comparable materials or hybrid corn varieties at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time 
any such interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture and distribute its products and  consequently  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
research and development landec is focusing its research and development resources on both existing and new applications of its intelimer technology 
expenditures for research and development for the fiscal year ended may   for the fiscal year ended may   for the seven month period ended may  and for the fiscal year ended october  were million  million  million and million  respectively 
research and development expenditures funded by corporate partners were  for the fiscal year ended may    for the fiscal year ended may    for the seven month period ended may  and  for the fiscal year ended october  the company may continue to seek funds for 
table of contents applied materials research programs from us government agencies as well as from commercial entities 
the company anticipates that it will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain its competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative  high quality products and services 
as of may   landec had employees engaged in research and development with experience in polymer and analytical chemistry  product application  product formulation  mechanical and chemical engineering 
competition the company operates in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition from large food packaging and agricultural companies is intense 
in addition  the nature of the company s collaborative arrangements and its technology licensing business may result in its corporate partners and licensees becoming competitors of the company 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the company  and many have substantially greater experience in conducting field trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
there can be no assurance that these competitors will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
patents and proprietary rights the company s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
the company has been granted twenty seven us patents with expiration dates ranging from to and has filed applications for additional us patents  as well as certain corresponding patent applications outside the united states  relating to the company s technology 
the company s issued patents include claims relating to compositions  devices and use of a class of temperature sensitive polymers that exhibit distinctive properties of permeability  adhesion and viscosity control 
there can be no assurance that any of the pending patent applications will be approved  that the company will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable  that any patents issued to the company will provide the company with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating the company s technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s products or design around the company s patents 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the commercial success of the company will also depend  in part  on its ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others 
the company has received  and may in the future receive  from third parties  including some of its competitors  notices claiming that it is infringing third party patents or other proprietary rights 
if the company were determined to be infringing any third party patent  the company could be required to pay damages  alter its products or processes  obtain licenses or cease certain activities 
in addition  if patents are issued to others which contain claims that compete or conflict with those of the company and such competing or conflicting claims are ultimately determined to be valid  the company may be required to pay damages  to obtain licenses to these patents  to develop or obtain alternative technology or to cease using such technology 
if the company is required to obtain any licenses  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
the company s failure to obtain a license to any technology that it may require to commercialize its products could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to the company  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to the company or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
if competitors of the company prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology also claimed by the company  the company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in 
table of contents substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to the company 
any such litigation or interference proceeding  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming and could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require the company to cease using such technology and consequently  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition to patent protection  the company also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances which the company seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its collaborators  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 
government regulations the company s products and operations are subject to regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
food products technology business the company s food packaging products are subject to regulation under the food  drug and cosmetic act fdc act 
under the fdc act any substance that when used as intended may reasonably be expected to become  directly or indirectly  a component or otherwise affect the characteristics of any food may be regulated as a food additive unless the substance is generally recognized as safe 
food additives may be substances added directly to food  such as preservatives  or substances that could indirectly become a component of food  such as waxes  adhesives and packaging materials 
a food additive  whether direct or indirect  must be covered by a specific food additive regulation issued by the fda 
the company believes its proprietary breatheway packaging technology products are not subject to regulation as food additives because these products are not expected to become a component of food under their expected conditions of use 
if the fda were to determine that the company s breatheway packaging technology products are food additives  the company may be required to submit a food additive petition 
the food additive petition process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
a determination by the fda that a food additive petition is necessary would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s agricultural operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws including the food quality protection act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process 
environmental concerns are  however  inherent in most agricultural operations  including those conducted by the company  and there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be material 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder  and further restrictions on the use of manufacturing chemicals could result in increased compliance costs 
the company is subject to the united states department of agriculture usda rules and regulations concerning the safety of the food products handled and sold by apio  and the facilities in which they are packed and processed 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspensions or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  product seizures  including cessation of manufacturing and sales  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
certain of the company s products are also subject to the perishable agricultural commodities act paca law 
paca regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs all the products sold by apio 
our failure to comply with the paca requirements could among other things  result in 
table of contents civil penalties  suspension or revocation of a license to sell produce  and in the most egregious cases  criminal prosecution  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
agricultural seed technology business the company s agricultural products are subject to regulations of the usda and the epa 
the company believes its current intellicoat seed coatings are not pesticides as defined in the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra and are not subject to pesticide regulation requirements 
the process of meeting pesticide registration requirements is lengthy  expensive and uncertain  and may require additional studies by the company 
there can be no assurance that future products will not be regulated as pesticides 
in addition  the company believes that its intellicoat seed coatings will not become a component of the agricultural products which are produced from the seeds to which the coatings are applied and therefore are not subject to regulation by the fda as a food additive 
while the company believes that it will be able to obtain approval from such agencies to distribute its products  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain necessary approvals without substantial expense or delay  if at all 
polymer manufacture the company s manufacture of polymers is subject to regulation by the epa under the toxic substances control act tsca 
pursuant to tsca  manufacturers of new chemical substances are required to provide a pre manufacturing notice pmn prior to manufacturing the new chemical substance 
after review of the pmn  the epa may require more extensive testing to establish the safety of the chemical  or limit or prohibit the manufacture or use of the chemical 
to date  pmns submitted by the company have been approved by the epa without any additional testing requirements or limitation on manufacturing or use 
no assurance can be given that the epa will grant similar approval for future pmns submitted by the company 
other the company and its products under development may also be subject to other federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations 
although landec believes that it will be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of its products and polymer materials  such regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold 
there can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or interpretations made by the fda  epa or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  relating to such matters as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  environmental controls  fire hazard control  and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances will not adversely affect the company s business 
there can also be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future  or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to do business 
furthermore  the introduction of the company s products in foreign markets may require obtaining foreign regulatory clearances 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain regulatory clearances for its products in such foreign markets 
employees as of may   landec had full time employees  of whom were dedicated to research  development  manufacturing  quality control and regulatory affairs and were dedicated to sales  marketing and administrative activities 
landec intends to recruit additional personnel in connection with the development  manufacturing and marketing of its products 
none of landec s employees is represented by a union  and landec believes relationships with its employees are good

except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described below under additional factors that may affect future results 
landec undertakes no 
table of contents obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast tm splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  intelimer packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems in june that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications and beginning in november for personal care applications  and intellicoat coated inbred corn seeds in the fall of with the acquisition of apio in december and landec ag in september  the company is focused on two core businesses food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the agricultural seed technology segment integrates the intellicoat seed coating technology with landec ag s direct marketing  telephone sales and distribution capabilities 
the company also operates a technology licensing research and development business which develops products to be licensed outside of the company s core businesses 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
notes and advances receivables apio has made advances to fruit growers for the development of orchards  and to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically  except for development advances  these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from harvested crops 
development advances and advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from twelve to sixty months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines the company may be unable to fully recoup its note or advance receivable and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total note or advance receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make 
table of contents payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to low risks related to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially sound national and regional retailers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory considered to be useable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab  sab 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized over the period of the agreement to revenue when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
prior to november   the company recognized noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees as revenue when received and when all significant contractual obligations of the company relating to the fees had been met 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees to recognize such fees over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
the company believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sab the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of november   was reported as a charge in the year ended october  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the research and development period or supply period commitment of the agreement 
during the year ended october   the impact of the change in accounting was to increase net loss by approximately million  or per share  comprised of the million cumulative effect of the change as described above per share  net of  of the related deferred revenue which was recognized as recycled revenue during per share 
recycled revenue refers to revenue that had previously been recognized as licensing revenue in the company s financial statements  but as a result of the company s adoption of sab  was reversed through a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in fiscal year and is now being recognized as revenue over the research and development period and or the supply period commitment of the agreement  whichever is longer 
during the fiscal years ended may  and may  and for the seven months ended may   and for fiscal year ended october      and  respectively  of the related deferred revenue was recognized as recycled revenue 
the remainder of the related deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue per fiscal year as follows  per year for through  and  for fiscal year contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible asset impairment the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october  and is required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually 
this evaluation incorporates a variety of estimates including the fair value of the company s operating segments 
if the carrying value of an operating segment s assets exceeds the estimated fair value  the company would likely be required to record an impairment loss  possibly for the entire carrying balance of goodwill and intangible assets 
to date no impairment losses have been incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb opinion sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
on april   the sec adopted a new rule that amended the compliance dates for sfas r such that the company is now allowed to adopt the new standard effective in the second quarter of fiscal year the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r as well as option valuation methodologies related to its stock option plans 
although the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  the company expects that the adoption of sfas r may have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future  the method of adoption and the option valuation method used 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption

the increase in apio s value added revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year is due to increased product offerings  increased sales to existing customers and the addition of new customers 
specifically  sales of apio s value added ounce specialty packaged retail product line grew and sales of apio s value added vegetable tray products grew during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year 
overall value added sales volume increased during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year 
apio trading apio trading revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to asia through apio s export company  cal ex and from the purchase and sale of whole commodity fruit and vegetable products domestically to wal mart 
the export portion of trading revenues for fiscal year was million or of total trading revenues 
the slight decrease in revenues in apio s trading business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to produce shortages during the winter months as a result of near record rains in the western portion of the united states 
trading sales volumes were lower by for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in volumes was virtually offset by higher average sales prices due to the scarcity of product during certain months of the year 
apio tech apio tech consists of apio s packaging technology business using its breatheway tm membrane technology 
the first commercial application included in apio tech is our banana packaging technology 
current revenues generated from apio tech are from the sale of our proprietary packaging for bananas 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of bananas for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to the company only selling banana packaging not bananas themselves in fiscal year in addition  the sales of banana packaging occurred solely during the company s fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year and were for market trial purposes 

table of contents apio service prior to its sale on june  to apio fresh  apio operated a domestic commodity vegetable business that marketed and sold whole produce for growers 
apio charged a per carton service fee for marketing and selling these whole commodity products 
subsequent to june   apio s service revenues consist of revenues generated from apio cooling  lp  a vegetable cooling operation in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position 
the decrease in service revenues during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year is due to a decrease in volumes in apio s cooling operation due to lower commodity product volumes from apio fresh and one month of commodity revenues in fiscal year before the sale of apio fresh 
landec ag landec ag revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of hybrid seed corn to farmers under the fielder s choice direct brand and from the sale of intellicoat coated corn and soybean seeds to farmers and seed companies 
for the fiscal years ended may  and may   over of landec ag s revenues were from the sale of uncoated hybrid seed corn under the fielder s choice brand 
the increase in revenues at landec ag during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year is due to a change in product mix to higher priced hybrid corn varieties that resulted in a increase in the average price per unit 
in addition  sales volumes increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year corporate corporate revenues consist of revenues generated from partnering with others under research and development agreements and supply agreements and from fees for licensing our proprietary intelimer technology to others and from the corresponding royalties from these license agreements 
the decrease in corporate revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period of the prior year is primarily due to the completion of two r d contracts ucb and a medical device collaboration in early fiscal year which resulted in r d revenues decreasing  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit in thousands fiscal year fiscal year ended ended may  may  change apio value added apio trading apio tech apio service total apio landec ag corporate total gross profit general there are numerous factors that can influence gross profits including product mix  customer mix  manufacturing costs  volume  sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory  to name a few

table of contents of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors 
therefore  it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually 
the company includes in cost of sales all the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these costs include the following raw materials including produce  seeds and packaging  direct labor  overhead including indirect labor  depreciation  and facility related costs and shipping and shipping related costs 
the following discussion surrounding gross profits includes management s best estimates of the reasons for the changes for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above 
apio value added the increase in gross profits for apio s value added specialty packaged vegetable business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to a increase in value added sales during fiscal year and improved manufacturing efficiencies through further automation of apio s production process 
these increases in gross profits were partially offset by produce shortages in march and the first half of april due to near record rains in the western us this past winter which reduced gross profits by approximately million 
apio trading apio s trading business is a buy sell business that realizes a commission based margin in the range 
the increase in gross profits during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a sales mix change to higher margin fruit and vegetable products which increased fiscal year gross margins to compared to gross margins of for the same period last year 
apio tech the increase in gross profits for apio tech for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to apio only selling its proprietary banana packaging in fiscal year versus selling bananas in its banana packaging in fiscal year which resulted in significant gross profit losses 
apio service the decrease in apio s service business gross profits during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was directly attributable to lower volume sales in apio s cooling operation and the sale of apio fresh in june landec ag the increase in gross profits for landec ag for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to the increase in revenues  partially offset by higher royalty fees on corn seed hybrids with traits  such as genetics or certain chemicals  resulting in lower gross profits as a percentage of sales in fiscal year compared to the same period last year 
corporate the decrease in gross profits for corporate for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the completion of two r d contracts ucb and a medical device collaboration in early fiscal year which resulted in r d gross profits decreasing  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year

research and development efforts at apio are focused on the company s proprietary breatheway membranes used for packaging produce  with recent focus on extending the shelf life of bananas and other shelf life sensitive vegetables and fruit 
at landec ag  the research and development efforts are focused on the company s proprietary intellicoat coatings for seeds  primarily corn seed 
at corporate  the research and development efforts are focused on uses for the proprietary intelimer polymers outside of food and agriculture 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to lower research and development expenses associated with the company s specialty packaging banana program as the focus of the program has shifted to market testing of the packaging technology with apio s partner  chiquita brands international  a greater shift of landec ag research and development personnel to production activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and a reduction in staff at corporate and lower facility related expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the  gain on the sale of land at apio which is netted against selling  general and administrative expenses  for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in selling and marketing expenses at apio and landec ag in order to increase revenues

minority interest expense the minority interest expense consists of the minority interest associated with the limited partners equity interest in the net income of apio cooling  lp 
the decrease in the minority interest in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to lower profits generated from apio cooling in fiscal year other other consists of non operating income and expenses

the export portion of trading revenues for fiscal year was million or of total trading revenues 
the increase in revenues in apio s trading business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may  was primarily due to changes in the provisions of certain export contracts 
based on these revised contracts  the company takes title to the products and therefore recognizes the revenue at its gross sales value rather than recording only the commission portion as revenue as it had done in previous years before the changes in the provisions on certain of these contracts had been completed 
in addition  export sales volumes were higher by for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may  apio tech apio tech consist of apio s packaging technology business using its breatheway tm membrane technology 
the first commercial application included in apio tech is our banana packaging technology 
during fiscal year  apio sold bananas in our proprietary packaging almost exclusively to food service companies whereas in the twelve months ended may   there were also product sales to retail grocery chains 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of bananas for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was due to the company not selling bananas to retail grocery stores in fiscal year resulting in a decrease in the unit volume of bananas sold 
this decrease was due to the company focusing on selling bananas to food service companies and developing alternative packaging formats during fiscal year during the fourth fiscal quarter of  apio began to transition from sourcing its own bananas to working with banana shippers who will package their bananas in landec s packaging and sell those packaged bananas to food service and retail customers

subsequent to june   apio s service revenues consist of revenues generated from apio cooling  lp  a vegetable cooling operation in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position 
the decrease in service revenues during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   is directly attributable to the sale of apio s domestic commodity vegetable business on june

corporate corporate revenues consist of revenues generated from partnering with others under research and development agreements and supply agreements and from fees for licensing our proprietary intelimer technology to others and from the corresponding royalties from these license agreements 
the decrease in corporate revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   is due primarily to a decrease in revenues from the million licensing agreement with ucb chemicals corporation ucb entered into in december which was recognized to revenue ratably over a month period through december and from the completion of the research and development agreement with a medical device company in june gross profit in thousands fiscal year twelve months ended ended may  may  change unaudited apio value added apio trading apio tech apio service total apio landec ag corporate total gross profit general there are numerous factors that can influence gross profits including product mix  customer mix  manufacturing costs raw materials  such as fresh produce  corn seed  polymer materials and packaging  labor and overhead  volume  sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory  to name a few 
many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors 
therefore  it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually 
the following discussion surrounding gross profits includes management s best estimates of the reasons for the changes for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   as outlined in the table above 
apio value added the increase in gross profits for apio s value added specialty packaged vegetable business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was due to a increase in value added sales during fiscal year  product mix changes to higher margin products such as vegetable trays and improved manufacturing efficiencies through further automation of apio s production 
table of contents process 
these increases in gross profits were partially offset by produce shortages in late december and most of january which reduced gross profits by million 
apio trading apio s trading business is a buy sell business that realizes a commission based margin in the range 
the decrease in gross profits during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was primarily due to a sales mix change to lower margin fruit products from higher margin broccoli products 
apio tech the decrease in gross profits for apio tech for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was primarily due to apio only selling bananas in its proprietary packaging to a few food service companies during fiscal year versus selling bananas to both food service companies and retail grocery chains in in addition  food service companies often do not purchase the entire container load of bananas that apio has had shipped from central america 
when this occurs  apio has to sell the remaining bananas on the open market at prices that do not cover its full costs and recognizes negative gross profits on the sale of those bananas 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  apio began to transition from sourcing its own bananas to working with banana shippers who will package their bananas in landec s packaging and sell those packaged bananas to food service and retail customers 
apio service the decrease in apio s service business gross profits during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was directly attributable to the sale of apio s domestic commodity vegetable business on june  landec ag the increase in gross profits for landec ag for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was due to the increase in revenues  partially offset by higher royalty fees on corn seed hybrids with traits  such as genetics or certain chemicals  resulting in lower gross profits as a percentage of sales in fiscal year compared to the twelve months ended may  corporate the decrease in gross profits for corporate for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was primarily due to the million licensing agreement with ucb  which was entered into in december  being recognized to gross profits ratably over a month period through december and from the completion of the research and development agreement with a medical device company in june

research and developments efforts at apio are focused on the company s proprietary breathable membranes used for packaging produce  with recent focus on extending the shelf life of bananas 
at landec ag  the research and development efforts are focused on the company s proprietary intellicoat coatings for seeds  primarily corn seed 
at corporate  the research and development efforts are focused on uses for the proprietary intelimer polymers outside of food and agriculture 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was primarily due to lower research and development expenses associated with the company s specialty packaging banana program as the focus of the program has shifted to market testing of the packaging technology and developing collaborative supply arrangements with banana shippers 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year compared to the twelve months ended may   was primarily due to a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses at apio as a result of the sale of apio s domestic commodity vegetable business on june  
table of contents other in thousands fiscal year twelve months ended ended may  may  change unaudited interest income interest expense minority interest expense other income total other expense interest income the decrease in interest income for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was due to a reduction in interest bearing notes receivable at apio 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was due to the company using cash generated from operations to pay down debt and thus lowering interest expenses 
minority interest expense the minority interest expense consists of the minority interest associated with the limited partners equity interest in the net income of apio cooling  lp 
other other consists of non operating income and expenses such as the gain or loss on the sale of assets 
the decrease in the net other income for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the twelve months ended may   was primarily due to a decrease in income recognized during fiscal year compared to twelve months ended may  during the twelve months ended may   other income included  in farm equipment rental income associated with the domestic commodity vegetable business sold in june and other miscellaneous credits 
seven months ended may  compared to seven months ended june  unaudited total revenues for the seven months ended may  were million compared to million during the same period in revenues from product sales and services for the seven months ended may  decreased to million from million during the same period of due primarily to decreased revenues in apio s fee for service commodity business which decreased to million during the seven months ended may  compared to million in revenues during the same period of as a result of the company focusing on its value added business  apio s export business which decreased to million during the seven months ended may  compared to million during the same period of as a result of decreased sales of broccoli and fruit to asia and apio s banana business which decreased to million during the seven months ended may  compared to million for the same period of as a result of reduced retail sales as the company prepared for market trials 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by increased revenues in apio s value added fresh cut and whole vegetable produce business which increased to million during the seven months ended may  from million in the same period of as a result of increased product offerings  increased sales to existing customers and the addition of new customers 
in addition  landec ag revenues increased to million during the seven months ended may  from million in the same period of due

selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the seven months ended may  compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during the seven months ended may  compared to the same period of is primarily due to a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses at apio resulting from its cost reduction efforts 
for the seven months ended may  sales and marketing expenses decreased to million from million during the same period of effective june   the company sold certain assets related to its former domestic commodity vegetable business to apio fresh  llc  in exchange for notes receivable  a long term produce supply agreement for the company s value added specialty packaging business and a per carton royalty for use of apio s brand names based on units sold by apio fresh  llc 
as a result of no longer being in the domestic commodity vegetable business  the company recorded a million charge at may   primarily for the write down of inventories and notes receivable associated with the domestic commodity vegetable business 
interest income for the seven months ended may  was  compared to  for the same period of interest expense for the seven months ended may  was  compared to million for the same period of the decrease in interest expense is due to using cash generated from operations  the sale of non strategic assets and from past equity financings to pay down debt and thus lower interest expenses 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  a net increase of million from million at may  cash flow from operating activities landec generated million of cash flow from operating activities during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the primary sources of cash during the fiscal year ended may  were from net income  a decrease in seed inventory  and an increase in payables as a result of the timing of payments 

table of contents cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended may  was million compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary uses of cash from investing activities in fiscal year were for the purchase of million of property and equipment and million invested in marketable securities 
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended may  was million compared to million for the same period last year 
the primary use of cash was to repay debt of million 
this use of cash was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of million of the company s common stock and the proceeds from the issuance of million of long term debt for the expansion of the apio facility 
capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended may   landec purchased vegetable processing equipment and expanded its processing facility to support the growth of apio s value added business 
these expenditures represented the majority of the million of equipment purchased 
debt in august  apio entered into a new million working capital line and a million equipment line the lines with wells fargo business credit  inc wells fargo 
the term of the lines is three years expiring on july  during fiscal year  the interest rate was calculated based on the libor rate plus  or approximately on an annual basis 
the lines contain restrictive covenants that require apio to meet certain financial tests including minimum levels of net income  minimum debt coverage ratio  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
apio was in compliance with all of the loan covenants throughout fiscal year landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of apio to secure the lines 
as of may   no amounts were outstanding under the lines 
on september   apio entered into with wells fargo bank na wells fargo a new million revolving line of credit that expires on august   a month  million equipment line of credit  and a month  million term note for equipment purchased under the equipment line of credit with wells fargo business credit collectively the loan agreement 
outstanding amounts under the loan agreement bear interest at either the prime rate or the libor adjustable rate plus at may  
the loan agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which requires apio to meet certain financial tests  including  minimum levels of net income  maximum leverage ratio  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of apio to secure the lines with wells fargo 
concurrently with entering into this agreement with wells fargo  the company paid off and terminated its lines of credit with wells fargo business credit 
at may   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit or the equipment line of credit 
apio has been in compliance with all loan covenants in the loan agreement since the inception of this loan 
landec ag has a revolving line of credit which allows for borrowings of up to million  based on landec ag s inventory levels 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is the prime rate plus  currently on an annual basis 
the line of credit contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  restrict the ability of landec ag to make payments on debt owed by landec ag to landec 
landec ag was in compliance with all of the loan covenants throughout fiscal year landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of landec ag to secure the line of credit 
at may   no amounts were outstanding under landec ag s revolving line of credit 
at may   landec s total debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations  was million and the total debt to equity ratio was as compared to at may  this debt was comprised of term debt and capital lease obligations  million of which is mortgage debt on apio s manufacturing facilities 
the amount of debt outstanding on the company s revolving lines of credit fluctuates 
table of contents over time 
borrowings on landec s lines of credit are expected to vary with seasonal requirements of the company s businesses 
contractual obligations the company s material contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of may   are as follows in thousands due in fiscal year ended may obligation total thereafter lines of credit long term debt capital leases interest expense operating leases licensing obligation purchase commitments total interest expense was determined based on the assumption that the company s lines of credit will have an average daily outstanding balance of million at an annual interest rate of for all periods presented 
the interest expense on long term notes and lease obligations is based on the payment schedules and interest rates from the relevant agreements 
landec is not a party to any agreements with  or commitments to  any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above 
landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  the development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms if at all 
landec believes that its cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and existing borrowing capacities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
additional factors that may affect future results landec desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e and rule b under the securities exchange act of specifically  landec wishes to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in this report  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  landec s actual results and could cause landec s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of landec 
landec assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 

table of contents our future operating results are likely to fluctuate which may cause our stock price to decline in the past  our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
historically  our direct marketer of hybrid corn seed  landec ag  has been the primary source of these fluctuations  as its revenues and profits are concentrated over a few months during the spring planting season generally during our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in addition  apio can be heavily affected by seasonal and weather factors which have impacted quarterly results  such as the high cost of sourcing product in december  january and march april due to a shortage of essential value added produce items 
our earnings may also fluctuate based on our ability to collect accounts receivables from customers and note receivables from growers 
our earnings from our food products technology business are sensitive to price fluctuations in the fresh vegetables and fruits markets 
excess supplies can cause intense price competition 
other factors that affect our food and or agricultural operations include the seasonality of our supplies  our ability to process produce during critical harvest periods  the timing and effects of ripening  the degree of perishability  the effectiveness of worldwide distribution systems  total worldwide industry volumes  the seasonality of consumer demand  foreign currency fluctuations  and foreign importation restrictions and foreign political risks 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
we may not be able to achieve acceptance of our new products in the marketplace our success in generating significant sales of our products will depend in part on the ability of us and our partners and licensees to achieve market acceptance of our new products and technology 
the extent to which  and rate at which  we achieve market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products is a function of many variables including  but not limited to price  safety  efficacy  reliability  conversion costs  marketing and sales efforts  and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner or new products and technologies may not gain market acceptance 
we are in the early stage of product commercialization of certain intelimer based specialty packaging  intellicoat seed coating and other intelimer polymer products and many of our potential products are in development 
we believe that our future growth will depend in large part on our ability to develop and market new products in our target markets and in new markets 
in particular  we expect that our ability to compete effectively with existing food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies will depend substantially on successfully developing  commer 
table of contents cializing  achieving market acceptance of and reducing the cost of producing our products 
in addition  commercial applications of our temperature switch polymer technology are relatively new and evolving 
our failure to develop new products or the failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face strong competition in the marketplace competitors may succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by us or that would render our technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
we operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition from large food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies is expected to be intense 
in addition  the nature of our collaborative arrangements may result in our corporate partners and licensees becoming our competitors 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do  and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
we have a concentration of manufacturing in one location for apio and may have to depend on third parties to manufacture our products any disruptions in our primary manufacturing operation would reduce our ability to sell our products and would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
additionally  we may need to consider seeking collaborative arrangements with other companies to manufacture our products 
if we become dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of our products  our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver those products on a timely basis may be affected 
failures by third parties may impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and impair our competitive position 
we may not be able to continue to successfully operate our manufacturing operations at acceptable costs  with acceptable yields  and retain adequately trained personnel 
our dependence on single source suppliers and service providers may cause disruption in our operations should any supplier fail to deliver materials we may experience difficulty acquiring materials or services for the manufacture of our products or we may not be able to obtain substitute vendors 
we may not be able to procure comparable materials or hybrid corn varieties at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time 
several services that are provided to apio are obtained from a single provider 
several of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products are currently purchased from a single source  including some monomers used to synthesize intelimer polymers and substrate materials for our breathable membrane products 
in addition  a majority of the hybrid corn varieties sold by landec ag are grown under contract by a single seed producer 
any interruption of our relationship with single source suppliers or service providers could delay product shipments and materially harm our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we may receive notices from third parties  including some of our competitors  claiming infringement by our products of patent and other proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  we could be required to alter our products or processes and our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
any pending patent applications we file may not be approved and we may not be able to develop additional proprietary products that are patentable 
any patents issued to us may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
patents 
table of contents held by others may prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
our operations are subject to regulations that directly impact our business our food packaging products are subject to regulation under the food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act 
under the fdc act  any substance that when used as intended may reasonably be expected to become  directly or indirectly  a component or otherwise affect the characteristics of any food may be regulated as a food additive unless the substance is generally recognized as safe 
we believe that food packaging materials are generally not considered food additives by the fda because these products are not expected to become components of food under their expected conditions of use 
we consider our breathable membrane product to be a food packaging material not subject to regulation or approval by the fda 
we have not received any communication from the fda concerning our breathable membrane product 
if the fda were to determine that our breathable membrane products are food additives  we may be required to submit a food additive petition for approval by the fda 
the food additive petition process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
a determination by the fda that a food additive petition is necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the use  storage  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in some of the manufacturing processes 
our failure to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended and changes in environmental regulations may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
our agricultural operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws including  the food quality protection act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process 
environmental concerns are  however  inherent in most agricultural operations  including those we conduct 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies could result in increased compliance costs 
the company is subject to the perishable agricultural commodities act paca law 
paca regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs all the products sold by apio 
our failure to comply with the paca requirements could among other things  result in civil penalties  suspension or revocation of a license to sell produce  and in the most egregious cases  criminal prosecution  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
adverse weather conditions and other acts of god may cause substantial decreases in our sales and or increases in our costs our food products and agricultural seed technology businesses are subject to weather conditions that affect commodity prices  crop yields  and decisions by growers regarding crops to be planted 
crop diseases and severe conditions  particularly weather conditions such as floods  droughts  frosts  windstorms  earthquakes and hurricanes  may adversely affect the supply of vegetables and fruits used in our business  which could reduce the sales volumes and or increase the unit production costs 
because a significant portion of the costs are fixed and contracted in advance of each operating year  volume declines due to production interruptions or other factors could result in increases in unit production costs which could result in substantial losses and weaken our financial condition 
we depend on strategic partners and licenses for future development our strategy for development  clinical and field testing  manufacture  commercialization and marketing for some of our current and future products includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners  licensees and others 
we are dependent on our corporate partners to develop  test  manufacture 
table of contents and or market some of our products 
although we believe that our partners in these collaborations have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within our control 
our partners may not perform their obligations as expected or we may not derive any additional revenue from the arrangements 
our partners may not pay any additional option or license fees to us or may not develop  market or pay any royalty fees related to products under the agreements 
moreover  some of the collaborative agreements provide that they may be terminated at the discretion of the corporate partner  and some of the collaborative agreements provide for termination under other circumstances 
in addition  we may not receive any royalties on future sales of the port tm product because in the related agreement we have no control over commercializing the product or generating revenues from the sales of the product 
our partners may pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to our technology 
furthermore  we may not be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  and our collaborative arrangements may not be successful 
both domestic and foreign government regulations can have an adverse effect on our business operations our products and operations are subject to governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
the manufacture of our products is subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
we may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive approvals or loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we have no reason to believe that we will not be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products and polymer materials  regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold 
future changes in regulations or interpretations relating to matters such as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  environmental controls  and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances may adversely affect our business 
we are subject to usda rules and regulations concerning the safety of the food products handled and sold by apio  and the facilities in which they are packed and processed 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  and suspensions  withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls and product seizures  including cessation of manufacturing and sales  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations in the future which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international operations and sales may expose our business to additional risks for fiscal year  approximately of our total revenues were derived from product sales to international customers 
a number of risks are inherent in international transactions 
international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by any of the following regulatory approval process  government controls  export license requirements  political instability  price controls  
table of contents trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  or difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
foreign regulatory agencies have or may establish product standards different from those in the united states  and any inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our international business  and our financial condition and results of operations 
while our foreign sales are currently priced in dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  may reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries to which the products are sold 
regulatory  geopolitical and other factors may adversely impact our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
cancellations or delays of orders by our customers may adversely affect our business during fiscal year  sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenues  with our largest customer  costco wholesale corp 
accounting for approximately of our revenues 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  a limited number of customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues 
we may experience changes in the composition of our customer base  as apio and landec ag have experienced in the past 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with any of our customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of our major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  since some of the products processed by apio at its guadalupe  california facility are sole sourced to its customers  our operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
our current customers may not continue to place orders  orders by existing customers may be canceled or may not continue at the levels of previous periods or we may not be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our sale of some products may increase our exposure to product liability claims the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of the products we develop involves an inherent risk of allegations of product liability 
if any of our products were determined or alleged to be contaminated or defective or to have caused a harmful accident to an end customer  we could incur substantial costs in responding to complaints or litigation regarding our products and our product brand image could be materially damaged 
either event may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we have taken and intend to continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to product liability claims  we may not be able to avoid significant liability 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with limits in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the annual aggregate 
our coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at an acceptable cost  if at all 
a product liability claim  product recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions over the past several years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the following events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly technological innovations applicable to our products  our attainment of or failure to attain milestones in the commercialization of our technology  our development of new products or the development of new products by our competitors  new patents or changes in existing patents applicable to our products  our acquisition of new businesses or the sale or disposal of a part of our businesses  
table of contents development of new collaborative arrangements by us  our competitors or other parties  changes in government regulations applicable to our business  changes in investor perception of our business  fluctuations in our operating results and changes in the general market conditions in our industry 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
since we order cartons and film for our products from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for such products  we could face a material inventory risk as part of our inventory planning  we enter into negotiated orders with vendors of cartons and film used for packing our products in advance of receiving customer orders for such products 
accordingly  we face the risk of ordering too many cartons and film since orders are generally based on forecasts of customer orders rather than actual orders 
if we cannot change or be released from the orders  we may incur costs as a result of inadequately predicting cartons and film orders in advance of customer orders 
because of this  we may currently have an oversupply of cartons and film and face the risk of not being able to sell such inventory and our anticipated reserves for losses may be inadequate if we have misjudged the demand for our products 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of these increased costs 
our seed products may fail to germinate properly and we may be subject to claims for reimbursement or damages for losses from customers who use such products farmers plant seed products sold by landec ag with the expectation that they will germinate under normal growing conditions 
if our seed products do not germinate at the appropriate time or fail to germinate at all  our customers may incur significant crop losses and seek reimbursement or bring claims against us for such damages 
although insurance is generally available to cover such claims  the costs for premiums of such policies are prohibitively expensive and we currently do not maintain such insurance 
any claims brought for failure of our seed products to properly germinate could materially and adversely affect our operating and financial results 
recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs the sarbanes oxley act of the act that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
in addition  nasdaq has made revisions to its requirements for companies  such as landec  that are listed on the nasdaq 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and financial compliance costs 
these changes could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
our controlling shareholders exert significant influence over corporate events that may conflict with the interests of other shareholders our executive officers and directors and their affiliates own or control approximately of our common stock including options exercisable within days 
accordingly  these officers  directors and shareholders may have the ability to exert significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval of amendments to our articles and bylaws and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions requiring shareholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or other business combination transaction  even if the transaction or amendments would be beneficial to our other shareholders 
in addition  our controlling shareholders may approve amendments to our articles or 
table of contents bylaws to implement anti takeover or management friendly provisions that may not be beneficial to our other shareholders 
terrorist attacks and risk of contamination may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price the september terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or trade disruptions impacting our domestic suppliers or our customers  may impact our operations and may  among other things  cause decreased sales of our products 
more generally  these events have affected  and are expected to continue to affect  the general economy and customer demand for our products 
while we do not believe that our employees  facilities  or products are a target for terrorists  there is a remote risk that terrorist activities could result in contamination or adulteration of our products 
although we have systems and procedures in place that are designed to prevent contamination and adulteration of our products  a disgruntled employee or third party could introduce an infectious substance into packages of our products  either at our manufacturing plants or during shipment of our products 
were our products to be tampered with  we could experience a material adverse effect in our business  operations and financial condition 
we may be exposed to employment related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect our business we have been subject in the past  and may be in the future  to claims by employees based on allegations of discrimination  negligence  harassment and inadvertent employment of illegal aliens or unlicensed personnel  and we may be subject to payment of workers compensation claims and other similar claims 
we could incur substantial costs and our management could spend a significant amount of time responding to such complaints or litigation regarding employee claims  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on our key employees and if one or more of them were to leave  we could experience difficulties in replacing them and our operating results could suffer the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior management  technical  sales  and marketing personnel 
the loss of any of our key personnel would likely harm our business 
in addition  competition for senior level personnel with knowledge and experience in our different lines of business is intense 
if any of our key personnel were to leave  we would need to devote substantial resources and management attention to replace them 
as a result  management attention may be diverted from managing our business  and we may need to pay higher compensation to replace these employees 
we may have to pursue new financings if we are unable to comply with provisions in our loan agreements in the future apio is subject to various financial and operating covenants under the well fargo bank lines of credit  including minimum levels of net income  maximum leverage ratio  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
the wells fargo bank agreement limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec 
if we violate any obligations under the lines of credit in the future  we could trigger an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our obligation to repay the indebtedness due under our lines 
if the indebtedness due under the lines were accelerated  we would be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets  seeking new debt financing from another lender or seeking additional equity capital  which might not be achievable or available on attractive terms  if at all  and which could substantially dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders
