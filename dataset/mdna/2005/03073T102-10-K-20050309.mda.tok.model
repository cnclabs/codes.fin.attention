item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi state managed healthcare company focused on serving people who receive healthcare benefits through publicly sponsored programs  including medicaid  schip and familycare 
we were founded in december with the objective of becoming the leading managed care organization in the us focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
having concluded our tenth year of operations  we continue to believe that managed healthcare remains the only proven mechanism that significantly reduces medical cost trends and helps our state partners control their costs 
in  we increased our total revenues by over total membership increased by  members  or  to  members as of december our revenue growth came from a number of factors including in a difficult state budgetary environment  we leveraged our partnerships with our states and negotiated a weighted average rate increase of for each of the states budget years that began in during the year of  we successfully integrated members in texas  florida and the district of columbia which came to us from competitors exiting these markets 
we implemented new product or program expansions the state of texas awarded us a contract for the travis service area  which includes austin and seven additional counties  bringing the number of counties that we serve in texas to while initial estimates of growth are modest  this service area complements our long term growth strategy 
currently  these counties are served by only one other health plan 
we successfully insourced our behavioral health benefits servicing eligible members in four states and the district of columbia 
we believe this strategy optimizes member health status  and reinforces our mission to coordinate our members physical and behavioral health and positions us well for future growth in existing states 
our same store premium revenues increased over from expansion in existing service areas and new markets 
in  our health benefits ratio hbr was versus in the hbr increase is driven by a reduction in the favorable prior year development offset by increased leverage of premium revenue 
the reduction in favorable prior year development is due to a decrease in claims payment variability related to maturing products and markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to in this improvement is a result of a reduction in overall sg a dollars  excluding the effect of premium tax  and an increased leverage of premium revenue due to favorable rate increases 
cash and investments totaled million at the end of a significant portion of this cash is regulated by state capital requirements 
however  million of our cash and investments was unregulated and held at the parent level 
in january  we used million of unregulated cash to effect the stock acquisition of careplus 
we expect acquisitions to continue to be an important part of our growth strategy 
as of december   over of our current membership has resulted from nine acquisitions and we are currently evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
effective january   we acquired careplus with membership of approximately  participating in new york state medicaid  child health plus and family health plus programs 
we believe our undrawn credit facility and our cash flows from operating activities position us to continue to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
the state of florida approved our request effective march  for expansion into polk and pasco counties for long term care services 
we have an exclusive risk sharing arrangement with cook children s health care network cchcn and cook children s physician network ccpn  which includes cook children s medical center ccmc  that covers an estimated  americaid members in fort worth  texas 
of these members  approximately  or  are children under the age of who may utilize services of either ccpn or ccmc 
of this subset  approximately  are signed up with primary care physicians who are either employees of ccpn or exclusively contracted with ccpn 
unless either party gives the other a written notice of non renewal six months in advance  the risk sharing arrangement with cchcn and ccpn would automatically be extended for a one year period commencing on august  on february   we received a written notice of non renewal from cchcn and ccpn  therefore this contract will terminate on august  it is our intent to enter into a new contract with ccpn  ccmc and the ccpn physicians individually 
however  there is no assurance that our contracting effort will be successful or that the terms of any new contract will be as favorable as the current risk sharing arrangement 
therefore  our results from operations could be harmed as a result of the expiration of the risk sharing arrangement and the impact could be material 
additionally  we could lose members if ccpn chooses to associate with another hmo or if cchcn obtains its own contract with the state of texas to provide healthcare services to medicaid recipients 
on july   the state of texas released a request for proposal rfp to re procure its current medicaid managed care programs  as well as to expand the current programs 
although the state has said it will announce contract awards in early with implementation continuing into  the announcement of the awards may not occur until after the conclusion of the texas legislative session on may  the rfp includes all of the current texas service areas and products in which we operate 
our response to the rfp included our current texas service areas and products as well as expansion into new service areas and products 
if we lost one or more contracts through the re procurement process  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
on september   we were informed that we were a successful bidder in a request for proposal from the state of indiana for expansion of its managed care program in because of limited expansion opportunities and provider network restrictions  we evaluated our market entry options and decided not to enter the market at this time 
in april  the maryland legislature enacted a budget for the fiscal year beginning july  that included a provision to reduce the premium paid to managed care organizations that did not meet certain hedis scores and whose medical loss ratio was below for the calendar year ended december  in may  the maryland secretary of health and mental hygiene  in consultation with maryland s legislative leadership  determined our premium recoupment to be  a liability for the recoupment was recorded with a corresponding charge to premium revenue during the year ended december  additionally  the legislature directed that the department of health and mental hygiene complete a study by september on the relevance of the medical loss ratio threshold as an indicator of quality 
the results of this  which were released in october  did not directly address what would happen in the future if a managed care organization reported a medical loss ratio below 
as a result  we believe the maryland legislature could enact similar legislation in as part of its fiscal year budget  requiring premium recoupment 
we have recorded a reduction in premium in our financial statements of our best estimate of the outcome of this issue as of the year ended december  it is possible that the maryland legislature in  as part of its fiscal year budget  could enact similar legislation relating to the year ended december  however  at this time we are unable to predict the regulatory  economic or political climate that might exist at that time 
accordingly  we have not recorded any liability for the twelve months ended december  however  if the maryland legislature were to enact legislation in april consistent with the legislation passed in april and we failed to meet the required quality measures  we could have a recoupment obligation for that period commencing on july  ranging from zero to approximately  with respect to the premium revenue for the twelve month period ended december  in the fourth quarter of  our florida health plan implemented medical review procedures designed to reduce the incidence of inappropriate authorizations of speech therapy and occupational therapy services 
in february of  the health plan was informed by the applicable regulatory agency  agency for health care administration ahca  that the medical review procedures it had implemented were not compliant with the medicaid contract and the state s therapy services handbook 
we were directed to reprocess and pay all denied claims and to file a corrective action plan 
our florida health plan disputed ahca s assessment of its medical review procedures 
ahca rejected the health plan s corrective action plan and we appealed their decision 
on january   the florida health plan reached an agreement with ahca to settle the issues relating to speech therapy and occupational therapy services 
the settlement did not have a material impact on the fourth quarter results of operations 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for health benefit services for our members 
we generally receive premiums in advance of arranging for services  and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed premium per member per month is paid to us to arrange for healthcare benefit services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
these premium payments are based upon eligibility determined by the state governments with which we have contracted 
errors in this eligibility determination on which we rely can result in positive and negative premium adjustments to the extent this information is adjusted by the state 
in all of our states  except florida  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for newborn obstetric deliveries 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are generated 
upon delivery of a newborn  each state is notified according to our contract 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member based on our authorization system for these services 
additionally  in some states we receive supplemental payments for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings 
any amounts that have not been received from the state by the end of the period are recorded on our balance sheet as premium receivables 
we also generate income from investments 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable our results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health benefits  as well as our ability to accurately predict costs incurred in recording the amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
expenses related to health benefits have two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include fees paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  radiology  dental and vision 
medically related administrative costs include expenses related to services such as health promotion  quality assurance  case management  disease management and hour on call nurses 
direct medical expenses also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical payments related to fees paid on a fee for service basis to our pcps  specialist physicians and other providers  including fees paid to third party vendors for ancillary services 
the balance related to fees paid on a capitation  or per member  basis 
primary care and specialist physicians not paid on a capitated basis are paid on a maximum allowable fee schedule set forth in the contracts with our providers 
we reimburse hospitals on a negotiated per diem  case rate or an agreed upon percent of their standard charges 
in maryland  the state sets the amount reimbursed to hospitals 
we have used the same methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical liabilities since our inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims  product and market experience 
as medical utilization patterns and cost trends change from year to year  our underlying claims payments reflect the variations in experience 
our estimates are revised based upon actual claims payments using historical per member per month claims cost  including provider settlements  changes in the age and gender of our membership and variations in the severity of medical conditions 
these variations are considered in determining our current medical liabilities and adjusted to reflect expected changes in cost or utilization patterns 
there are certain aspects of the managed care business that are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state eg  cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births  and the number of neonatal intensive care babies as well as non medical aspects  such as changes in provider contracting and contractual benefits 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix and growth of members 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience and authorization data 
authorization data is information captured in our medical management system  which identifies services requested by providers or members 
the medical cost related to these authorizations is estimated by pricing the approved services using contractual or historical amounts adjusted for known variables such as historical claims trends 
these estimated costs are included as a component of ibnr in the more current months 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims  and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in claims payment patterns  membership  products and authorization trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available and any adjustments are included in current operations 
we utilize the services of independent actuarial consultants  who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
judgments are made based on knowledge and experience about past and current events 
there is a likelihood that actual results could be materially different if different assumptions or conditions prevail 
also included in claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to or from contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
the following table shows the components of the change in medical claims payable for the years ended december   and in thousands medical claims payable as of january medical claims payable assumed from businesses acquired during the year health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december in the current year  we experienced a reduction in the favorable prior year development of approximately million related to and prior 
in  we experienced an increase in the favorable prior year development of million related to and prior 
the current year reduction was primarily the result of more precise claims estimates at december  due to a decrease in claims payment variability related to our maturing products and markets compared to the prior year 
actuarial claims estimates are based upon facts and circumstances at the time we record them 
we believe that our claims experience has stabilized as the company has grown  allowing us to more accurately estimate our medical expense liabilities at each period end 
as we add new markets and products  the claims fluctuations may increase  but overall growth in the size of the company mitigates this volatility on a consolidated basis 
the company s methodology includes adding a factor to compensate for normal claim uncertainty 
the more precisely we have been able to predict claims patterns  the lower the required factor for uncertainty as a percentage of our medical liability 
due to the changing mix of members  products and markets  this factor is a necessary component of our medical liabilities 
while our prior year development historically has been favorable  there is no guarantee this will continue and the factor for uncertainty mitigates the risk of emerging claims experience that is different from historical patterns 
the health benefits expenses incurred during the period related to prior years relate almost entirely to revisions in estimates for the immediately preceding year 
the application of our methodology has resulted in reversals of estimated incurred claims related to prior years in each of the years in the three year period ended december  the resulting impact on operations is a function of the variation of the change in estimate from year to year 
included above was the impact on earnings of the change in our factor for uncertainty of a favorable development of million in  an unfavorable development of million in and a favorable development of million in changes in estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
since our estimates are based upon the blended per member per month claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experience 
these variables include fluctuations in claims payment patterns  changes in membership levels  number and mix of products  benefit structure  severity of illness and authorization trends 
we believe there will be less volatility as we increase in size and gain more maturity in our markets 
we believe that the amount of claims payable is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of claims payable and actual claims payable  net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted rates  including estimated tax rates in states where we do business applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years 
historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and  we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  net of accumulated amortization 
we review our intangible assets with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future utility and cash flows and other internal and external factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
recent accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised sfas no 
r  shared based payment  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and amends fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of proforma disclosures either a all prior presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are in the process of evaluating these methods 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in note h to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios for the years ended december   and all ratios  with the exception of the health benefits ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended december  premium revenue investment income total revenues health benefits selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes net income the health benefits ratio is shown as a percentage of premium revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premium received and the health benefits provided 
the following table sets forth the approximate number of our members in each of our service areas for the periods presented 
december  market texas      florida maryland new jersey district of columbia illinois total on december   we announced a two for one split of our common stock 
the stock split was in the form of a one hundred percent stock dividend of one share of common stock for every share of common stock issued and outstanding 
the stock dividend was distributed on january   to shareholders of record on december  all share and per share data described herein give retroactive effect to the two for one stock split effective january  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from  million in the increase was primarily due to internal growth in membership as well as premium rate increases 
total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  investment income increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase in investment income is primarily due to increased levels of cash and investments that were a result of having the proceeds from the secondary offering that occurred in october available for a full year of investing in and cash generated from operations  as well as increases in market interest rates and a shift in our investment portfolio toward longer term investments with higher yields 
health benefits expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from  million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in membership 
the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in hbr is driven by less favorable development than in the prior year due to a combination of more mature claims patterns in existing products and markets offset by increased leverage of premium revenue 
this had the effect of increasing the current year hbr even though there was no increase in our core medical run rates 
the underlying medical performance continues to be stable with trend patterns consistent with those of the prior year  except for more moderate seasonal respiratory disorders than in the prior year and continued elevated obstetric services 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the net increase in sg a was primarily due to an increase in premium taxes that the states of texas and new jersey began assessing in september and july  respectively  a decrease in purchased services related to strategic initiatives in for operational improvements  including expenses related to the implementation of the hipaa guidelines  and a decrease in experience rebate expense in our texas market 
our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in this improvement was achieved due to increased leverage of premium revenue from successful rate increases and increased membership levels 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease primarily relates to the repayment of our outstanding balance of our credit facility on october   with a portion of the net proceeds from our october  public offering 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for was million with an effective tax rate of as compared to the million for with an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  an increase in investments in tax advantaged securities and the resolution of potential tax issues from a prior year 
net income net income for rose million to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in diluted earnings per share rose as compared to an increase in net income of due to the increase in shares outstanding primarily resulting from the issuance of  shares from our october  public offering 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  from  million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of php  members and st 
augustine  members  as well as internal growth in overall membership 
total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  investment income decreased million to million for the year ended december  the decrease in investment income was primarily due to the continued decline in market interest rates and increased levels of tax advantaged securities partially offset by an increase in overall cash and investments levels throughout the year 
cash and investments levels increased due to proceeds from our public offering and cash generated from operations 
health benefits expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in membership 
the health benefits ratio  as a percentage of premium revenue  for the year ended december  was compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in sg a was primarily due to an increase in wages and related expenses for additional staff to support our increased membership  expenses related to implementation of the hipaa guidelines  as well as expenses related to market development activities 
our sg a ratio to revenue was for both the years ended december  and interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase primarily related to increased average borrowings under our revolving credit facility to partially finance the php acquisition 
on october   we used a portion of the net proceeds from our october  public offering to repay the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for was million with an effective tax rate of as compared to the million for with an effective tax rate of 
net income net income for rose million to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in diluted earnings per share rose as compared to an increase in net income of  due to the increase in shares outstanding primarily resulting from the issuance of  shares from our october  public offering 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short and long term investments of million and restricted investments on deposit for licensure of million 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our million credit agreement 
cash and investments totaled million at december  a significant portion of this cash and investments is regulated by state capital requirements 
however  million of our cash and investments were unregulated and held at the parent level 
on october   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  including an over allotment issuance of  shares 
net proceeds from the offering  after fees and expenses  were approximately million 
on october   we used million of proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
the balance of approximately million was used to partially fund the careplus acquisition effective january  cash from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash from operations is primarily due to the following items reductions in cash flows due to a change of million in unearned revenue due to the early receipt of premium revenue received for two states in versus one state in and  a reduction in the increase in the claim liability of million primarily related to the payment of provider settlements in  an increase of million in the change of accounts payable  accrued and other due to an increase in premium tax payable and the accrual of a potential recoupment of premium in maryland  offset by increases in cash flows due to a decrease in the reduction of prepaid expenses and other current assets of million due to the accrual of an experience rebate receivable in that remains in  and an increase in net income of million 
cash flows provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a net increase in the proceeds from sales of investments offset by purchases of investments in compared to the cash for these additional investments in was generated from our public offering in october  as well as cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
the weighted average maturity is less than six months 
we utilize investment vehicles such as commercial paper  municipal bonds  us government backed agencies  auction rate securities and us treasury instruments 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their cash 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield on consolidated investments as of december  was approximately 
cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from our public offering in of million partially offset by million in repayments in of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on october   we entered into a million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement contains a provision which allows us to obtain  subject to certain conditions  an increase in revolving commitments of up to an additional million 
the proceeds of the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  permitted acquisitions of businesses  assets and technologies 
the borrowings under the credit agreement will accrue interest at one of the following rates  at our option eurodollar plus the applicable margin or an alternate base rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for eurodollar borrowings is between and and the applicable margin for alternate base rate borrowings is between and 
the applicable margin will vary depending on our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of amerigroup corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  php holdings  inc  including the stock of their respective wholly owned managed care subsidiaries 
there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit agreement that ranges from to  depending on the leverage ratio 
the credit agreement terminates on october  and was undrawn as of december  our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum statutory capital requirements prescribed by various jurisdictions  including the departments of insurance in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries were in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements for the next months 
in january  we used million of unregulated cash to effect the stock acquisition of careplus 
remaining cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to meet current cash requirements without the need to liquidate securities held earlier than anticipated 
we believe that internally generated funds and available funds under our credit agreement will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategy for at least months

our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under non cancelable office space leases 
capital lease obligations 
our capital lease obligations are primarily related to leased furniture  fixtures and equipment 
the terms of these leases are normally between three and five years 
long term borrowings credit agreement 
on october   we entered into a million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement contains a provision which allows us to obtain  subject to certain conditions  an increase in revolving commitments of up to an additional million

the credit agreement terminates on october  and was undrawn as of december  commitments lease guarantee 
in connection with our acquisition of php  we agreed to guarantee a certain lease for office space operated by the former management of php 
the lease term ends on march  regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos and one mco 
hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  certain state regulatory agencies require individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries are in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of approximately million 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted rules which  to the extent that they are implemented by the states  set new minimum net worth requirements for insurance companies  hmos and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
the change in rules for insurance companies became effective as of december  illinois  texas and the district of columbia adopted various forms of the rules as of december   and  respectively 
since our maryland subsidiary is licensed in both the district of columbia and maryland  the highest risk based capital requirement between the two will prevail 
new jersey and florida have not yet adopted risk based capital as their net worth requirements 
the naic s hmo rules  if adopted by these states in their proposed form  may increase the minimum capital required for our subsidiaries 
effective december   our new jersey subsidiary is required to maintain a statutory capital level greater than the state regulations 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements at december  include future minimum rental commitments of million and a lease guarantee of  both of which are disclosed in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no investments  loans or any other known contractual arrangements with special purpose entities  variable interest entities or financial partnerships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had short term investments of million  long term investments of million and investments on deposit for licensure of million 
these investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities between three and months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
credit risk is managed by investing in commercial paper  money market funds  us treasury securities  cash escrow accounts  asset backed securities  debt securities of government sponsored entities  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
our investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and our cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
we have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  and as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
as of december   a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change in our annual investment income 
risk factors risks related to being a regulated entity changes in government regulations designed to protect providers and members rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 
our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders 
changes in existing laws and rules  the enactment of new laws and rules and changing interpretations of these laws and rules could  among other things force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health benefits and administrative costs  impose additional capital requirements  and increase or change our claims liability 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends  distributions or administrative fees by our subsidiaries to us  it could negatively affect our business strategy 
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
we also have administrative services agreements with our subsidiaries in which we agree to provide them with services and benefits both tangible and intangible in exchange for the payment of a fee 
if the regulators were to deny our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends to us or restrict or disallow the payment of the administrative fee  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
regulations could limit our profits as a percentage of revenues 
our new jersey and maryland subsidiaries are subject to minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenue 
our florida subsidiary is subject to minimum behavioral health expense levels as a percentage of behavioral health premium 
in new jersey  maryland and florida  contractual sanctions may be imposed if these levels are not met 
in addition  our texas plans are required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels 
these regulatory requirements  changes in these requirements and additional requirements by our other regulators could limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues  which could harm our operating results 
we have been required  and may in the future be required  to make payments to the states as a result of not meeting these expense and profit levels 
our failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties and limitations on our profitability 
violation of the laws or regulations governing our operations could result in the imposition of sanctions  the cancellation of our contracts to provide services  or in the extreme case  the suspension or revocation of our licenses 
for example  in two markets in which we operate we are required to spend a minimum percentage of our premium revenue on medical expenses 
if we fail to comply with this requirement  we could be required to pay monetary damages 
additionally  we could be required to file a corrective plan of action with the state and we could be subject to further fines and additional corrective measures if we did not comply with the corrective plan of action 
our failure to comply could also affect future rate determinations 
these regulations could limit the profits we can obtain 
while we have not been subject to any fines or violations that were material  we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to material fines or other sanctions in the future 
if we became subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions were imposed upon us  our ability to continue to operate our business could be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time we have been subject to sanctions as a result of violations of marketing regulations in illinois and florida and for failure to meet timeliness of the payment requirements in new jersey 
in and  our florida plan was fined for marketing violations 
in july  our new jersey subsidiary received a notice of deficiency for failure to maintain provider network requirements in one new jersey county as required by our medicaid contract with new jersey 
we submitted to the state of new jersey a corrective action plan and a request for a waiver of certain contractual provisions on august  on october   the state of new jersey denied our request for a waiver  but we have been granted extensions to correct the network deficiency through march  prior to the expiration of the extension  we will renew our request for a waiver or an additional extension of the time in which to correct the network deficiencies 
on october   we responded to a civil investigative demand cid of the hmo industry by the office of the attorney general of the state of texas relating to processing of provider claims 
we understand from the office of the attorney general that responses were required from the nine largest hmos in texas  of which  at the time  we were the ninth 
the other eight are hmos that primarily provide commercial products 
the cid is being conducted in connection with allegations of unfair contracting  delegating and payment practices and violations of the texas deceptive trade practices consumer protection act and article of the texas insurance code by hmos 
it is our understanding that we are not currently the target of any investigation by the office of the attorney general 
we have responded to all of the requests for information 
the office of the attorney general could request additional information or clarification that could be costly and time consuming for us to produce 
hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies 
hipaa created civil penalties for  among other things  billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
hipaa establishes new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including a whistle blower program 
further  hipaa imposes civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with the privacy and security standards set forth in the regulation 
despite a press release issued by the department of health and human services  hhs recommending that congress create a private right of action under hipaa  no such private cause of action has yet been created  and we do not know when or if such changes may be enacted 
the federal government has enacted  and state governments are enacting  other fraud and abuse laws as well 
our failure to comply with hipaa or these other laws could result in criminal or civil penalties and exclusion from medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs and could lead to the revocation of our licenses 
these penalties or exclusions  were they to occur  would negatively impact our ability to operate our business 
compliance with new federal and state rules and regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures 
in august  hhs issued a regulation under hipaa requiring the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
although compliance with the new transactions regulation was required by october   cms issued its guidance on the october compliance deadline for the hipaa transactions and code set rules  stating that enforcement by cms will be on a complaint driven basis 
since that time  many health organizations have operated under contingency plans pending their full implementation of these regulatory requirements 
in february  hhs finalized a regulation to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
this security regulation requires compliance by april the next milestone date for us is implementation of the national provider identifier npi by may we expect to be fully compliant by the required dates 
to the extent that state laws impose stricter privacy standards than the hipaa privacy regulations or to the extent that a state seeks and receives an exception from hhs regarding certain state laws  such laws will not be preempted 
the states ability to promulgate stricter rules regarding privacy make compliance with the regulatory landscape more difficult 
if we enter new markets with different  more stringent privacy rules  we may incur significant additional costs in complying with these more stringent state rules  or our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with these rules 
future costs may be incurred in complying with the security and npi regulations 
we are in the process of developing our compliance plan for the npi regulations and cannot estimate the cost of compliance at this time 
further  compliance with these regulations may require additional changes  beyond those implemented to comply with privacy requirements  to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states 
the new regulations and related costs to comply with the new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  failure to comply with the new regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
on june   cms published final regulations regarding medicaid managed care 
the final regulations implemented requirements of the balanced budget act of bba that are intended to give states more flexibility in their administration of medicaid managed care programs  provide certain new patient protections for medicaid managed care enrollees  and require states rates to meet new actuarial soundness requirements 
the effective date for compliance with the regulation was august   with an extension provided to states operating under an demonstration waiver with a three year bba extension 
if states fail to comply with the new regulations they could lose their funding from the federal fund matching program 
the new regulations have been reflected in amendments in our contracts or new contracts with the medicaid agencies in our various markets  with the exception of the maryland market  which currently operates under the demonstration waiver with the bba extension 
compliance with these new provisions have required changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nyse  have imposed various requirements on public companies  including requiring changes in corporate governance practices 
our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls over our financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of our testing  or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm  may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses 
our compliance with section will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time and effort 
moreover  if we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse  sec or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
changes in healthcare laws could reduce our profitability 
numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced  some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time 
we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business 
although some of the recent changes in government regulations  such as the removal of the requirements on the enrollment mix between commercial and public sector membership  have encouraged managed care participation in public sector programs  we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will continue to favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare 
an example is state and federal legislation that would enable physicians to collectively bargain with managed healthcare organizations 
the legislation  as currently proposed  generally contains an exemption for public sector managed healthcare organizations 
if legislation of this type were passed without this exemption  it would negatively impact our bargaining position with many of our providers and might result in an increase in our cost of providing medical benefits 
we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the effect which they might have on us 
legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation  provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements could seriously harm our operations and financial results 
changes in federal funding mechanisms could reduce our profitability 
as part of president bush s budget submission to congress  there are a number of proposals designed to crack down on inappropriate financing mechanisms employed by the states  primarily through use of intergovernmental transfers 
these initiatives  together with medicaid expansion proposals  are estimated to generate billion in net reductions in medicaid spending over a ten year period 
hhs is also interested in offering states increased flexibility of its medicaid program for optional populations and services in exchange for more predictable cost growth within the overall medicaid program 
the president s budget contains little detail on this medicaid reform proposal  and it is expected that more discussion of the president s medicaid reform proposal will occur throughout the year 
it is uncertain whether any of these proposals  or a variation thereof  will be enacted sometime in the future 
if the president s proposals are ultimately adopted and states are required to reduce or change funding mechanisms  our operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 
reductions in medicaid funding by the states could substantially reduce our profitability 
most of our revenues come from state government medicaid premiums 
the base premium rate paid by each state differs  depending on a combination of various factors such as defined upper payment limits  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility category 
future levels of medicaid premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 
changes to medicaid programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under such programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
we believe that additional reductions in medicaid payments could substantially reduce our profitability 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state in the event of unavailability of state funds 
in some jurisdictions  such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
state governments generally are experiencing budgetary shortfalls 
budget problems in the states in which we operate could result in limited increases or even decreases in the premiums paid to us by the states 
if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us  or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
if state governments do not renew our contracts with them on favorable terms  our business will suffer 
as of december   we served members who received healthcare benefits through contracts with the regulatory entities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
five of these contracts  which are with the states of florida  maryland  new jersey and texas  individually accounted for or more of our revenues for the year ended december   with the largest of these contracts representing approximately of our revenues 
if any of our contracts were not renewed on favorable terms or were terminated for cause or if we were to lose a contract in a re bidding process  our business would suffer 
all our contracts have been extended until at least mid termination or non renewal of any single contract could materially impact our revenues and operating results 
some of our contracts are subject to a re bidding process 
for example  we are subject to a re bidding process in each of our three texas markets 
our texas markets are re bid every six years and the re bidding process occurred in although the state of texas has said it will announce contract awards in early with implementation continuing into  the announcement of the awards may not occur until after the conclusion of the texas legislative session on may  until the announcement is made and the legislative review process is complete  we can give no assurance that we will be able to enter into new markets and new products or retain our current business in existing markets 
if we lost a contract through the re bidding process  or if an increased number of competitors were awarded contracts in a specific market  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our schip contract covering our three florida markets expires on september   with the state of florida having the option to extend the contract for two additional one year terms 
we can give no assurance that the contracts will not be re bid 
if we lost a contract through the re bidding process  or if an increased number of competitors were awarded contracts in a specific market  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease 
states may only mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state s application for renewal  our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership 
we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by the state government 
inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 
premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by the state government 
from time to time  states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
alternatively  a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to receive payment 
our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 
if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations we may be required to make additional capital contributions 
our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos and one mco 
hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state 
additionally  state regulatory agencies may require  at their discretion  individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries  we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary 
any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 
risks related to our business receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively impact our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these premiums are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract period to facilitate access to healthcare services as established by the state governments 
we have less control over costs related to the provision of healthcare than we do over our selling  general and administrative expenses 
historically  our expenses related to health benefits as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated 
for example  our expenses related to health benefits were of our premium revenue in  and of our premium revenue in if premiums are not increased and expenses related to health benefits rise  our earnings could be impacted negatively 
in addition  our actual health benefits costs may exceed our estimated costs 
the premiums we receive under our current contracts may therefore be inadequate to cover all claims  which could cause our profits to decline 
maryland sets the rates that must be paid to hospitals by all payors 
it is possible for the state to increase rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us 
if this were to occur  or if other states were to take similar actions  our profitability would be harmed 
premiums are contractually payable to us before or during the month for services that we are obligated to provide to our members 
our cash flow would be negatively impacted if premium payments are not made according to contract terms 
our inability to manage medical costs effectively would reduce our profitability 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
changes in healthcare regulations and practices  level of use of healthcare services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  new medical technologies and other external factors  including general economic conditions such as inflation levels  are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of healthcare services 
although we have been able to manage medical costs through a variety of techniques  including various payment methods to primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements  medical management and quality management programs  our information systems and reinsurance arrangements  we may not be able to continue to manage costs effectively in the future 
it is possible that claims previously denied and claims previously paid to non network providers will be appealed and subsequently reprocessed at different amounts 
this would result in an adjustment to claims expense 
if our costs for medical services increase  our profits could be reduced  or we may not remain profitable 
we have a significant relationship with cook children s physician network in fort worth  texas 
any material modification or discontinuation of this relationship could negatively affect our results of operations 
we have an exclusive risk sharing arrangement with cook children s health care network cchcn and cook children s physician network ccpn  which includes cook children s medical center ccmc  that covers an estimated  americaid members in fort worth  texas 
of these members  approximately  or  are children under the age of who may utilize services of either ccpn or ccmc 
of this subset  approximately  are signed up with primary care physicians who are either employees of ccpn or exclusively contracted with ccpn 
unless either party gives the other a written notice of non renewal six months in advance  the risk sharing arrangement with cchcn and ccpn would automatically be extended for a one year period commencing on august  on february   we received a written notice of non renewal from cchcn and ccpn  therefore this contract will terminate on august  it is our intent to enter into a new contract with ccpn  ccmc and the ccpn physicians individually 
however  there is no assurance that our contracting effort will be successful or that the terms of any new contract will be as favorable as the current risk sharing arrangement 
therefore  our results from operations could be harmed as a result of the expiration of the risk sharing arrangement and the impact could be material 
additionally  we could lose members if ccpn chooses to associate with another hmo or if cchcn obtains its own contract with the state of texas to provide healthcare services to medicaid recipients 
our limited ability to predict our incurred medical expenses accurately could negatively impact our reported results 
our medical expenses include estimates of medical expenses ibnr 
we estimate our ibnr medical expenses based on a number of factors  including authorization data  prior claims experience  maturity of markets  complexity and mix of products and stability of provider networks 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change 
we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted on a regular basis to calculate and review the adequacy of our medical liabilities  in addition to using our internal resources 
we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to such ibnr estimates will not harm our results of operations 
further  our inability to accurately estimate ibnr may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further exacerbating the extent of the harm on our results 
we maintain reinsurance to protect us against severe or catastrophic medical claims  but we can provide no assurance that such reinsurance coverage will be adequate or available to us in the future or that the cost of such reinsurance will not limit our ability to obtain it 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy or integrating acquired business could adversely affect our business 
historically  acquisitions including the acquisition of medicaid contract rights and related assets of other health plans  both in our existing service areas and in new markets  have been a significant factor in our growth 
although we cannot predict our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions with complete accuracy  we believe that acquisitions similar in nature to those we have historically executed will be important to our growth strategy 
many of the other potential purchasers of these assets have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  many of the sellers are interested in either selling  along with their medicaid assets  other assets in which we do not have an interest  or selling their companies  including their liabilities  as opposed to just the assets of the ongoing business 
therefore  we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us or that we can obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions 
we are currently evaluating potential acquisitions that would increase our membership  as well as acquisitions of complementary healthcare service businesses 
these potential acquisitions are at various stages of consideration and discussion and we may enter into letters of intent or other agreements relating to these proposals at any time 
however  we cannot predict when or whether we will actually acquire these businesses 
we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we will be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if  as a result of the acquisition  we will operate in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
our existing credit facility imposes certain restrictions on acquisitions 
we may not be able to meet these restrictions 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate our acquisitions with our existing operations 
this may include the integration of additional employees who are not familiar with our operations  existing provider networks  which may operate on different terms than our existing networks  existing members  who may decide to switch to another healthcare provider  and disparate information and record keeping systems 
we may be unable to successfully identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions  including integrating the acquired businesses on to our technology platform  or to implement our operations strategy in order to operate acquired businesses profitably 
we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that incurring expenses to acquire a business will result in the acquisition being consummated 
these expenses could impact our selling  general and administrative expense ratio 
if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired businesses  our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 
failure of a new business would negatively impact our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to be able to obtain a state contract and process claims 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license  winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs  the new business would fail 
we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover start up costs 
the costs associated with starting up the business could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
ineffective management of rapid growth or our inability to grow could negatively affect our results of operations  financial condition and business 
we have experienced rapid growth 
in  we had million of premium revenue 
in  we had  million in premium revenue 
this increase represents a compound annual growth rate of 
depending on acquisition and other opportunities  we expect to continue to grow rapidly 
continued growth could place a significant strain on our management and on other resources 
we anticipate that continued growth  if any  will require us to continue to recruit  hire  train and retain a substantial number of new and highly skilled medical  administrative  information technology  finance and other support personnel 
our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
if we continue to experience rapid growth  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our operations  and our management may fail to anticipate adequately all demands that growth will place on our resources 
in addition  due to the initial costs incurred upon the acquisition of new businesses  rapid growth could adversely affect our short term profitability 
our inability to manage growth effectively or our inability to grow could have a negative impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to competition that impacts our ability to increase our penetration of the markets that we serve 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
we compete with numerous types of competitors  including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided 
some of the health plans with which we compete have substantially larger enrollments  greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do 
while many states mandate health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants  the programs are voluntary in other states  such as illinois 
subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications  the federal government requires that there be choice for medicaid recipients among managed care programs 
voluntary programs and mandated competition will impact our ability to increase our market share 
in addition  in most states in which we operate we are not allowed to market directly to potential members  and therefore  we rely on creating name brand recognition through our community based programs 
where we have only recently entered a market or compete with health plans much larger than we are  we may be at a competitive disadvantage unless and until our community based programs and other promotional activities create brand awareness 
restrictions and covenants in our credit facility could limit our ability to take actions 
on october   we entered into a new million credit agreement with four lenders 
the credit agreement contains a provision which allows us to obtain  subject to certain conditions  an increase in revolving commitments of up to an additional million 
our credit agreement is secured by our assets and by the common stock of our direct  wholly owned subsidiaries 
pursuant to the credit agreement  we must meet certain financial covenants at the parent company and consolidated level 
as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
these financial covenants include meeting certain financial ratios  a limit on annual capital expenditures  and a minimum net worth requirement 
as of december   the credit agreement was undrawn 
events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in the competitive environment  could impair our operating performance  which could affect our ability to comply with the terms of the credit agreement 
breaching any of the covenants or restrictions could result in the unavailability of the credit agreement or a default under the credit agreement 
we can provide no assurance that our assets or cash flows will be sufficient to fully repay outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement or that we would be able to restructure such indebtedness on terms favorable to us 
if we were unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under the credit agreement  the lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness 
our inability to maintain satisfactory relationships with providers would harm our profitability 
our profitability depends  in large part  upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers 
our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians and specialists usually are for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year terms  subject to termination by us for cause based on provider conduct or other appropriate reasons 
the contracts generally may be canceled by either party upon to days prior written notice 
our contracts with hospitals are usually for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year periods  subject to termination for cause due to provider misconduct or other appropriate reasons 
generally  our hospital contracts may be canceled by either party without cause on to days prior written notice 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 
we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
although we have established long term relationships with many of our providers  we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our profitability will be harmed 
on occasion  our members obtain care from providers that are not in our network and with which we do not have contracts 
to the extent that we know of such instances  we attempt to redirect their care to a network provider 
we have generally reimbursed non network providers at the rates paid to comparable network providers or at the applicable rate that the provider could have received under the traditional fee for service medicaid program or at a discount therefrom 
in some instances  we pay non network providers pursuant to the terms of our contracts with the state 
however  some non network providers have requested that we pay them at their highest billing rate  or full billed charges 
full billed charges are significantly more than the amount the non network providers could otherwise receive under the traditional fee for service medicaid program 
to the extent that non network providers are successful in obtaining payment at rates in excess of the rates that we have historically paid to non network providers  our profitability could be materially adversely affected 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 
in the past  the managed care industry has received negative publicity 
this publicity has led to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services  require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate  further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting our operating results 
we may be subject to claims relating to medical malpractice  which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
in addition  some states are considering legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
in addition  we may be subject to other litigation that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance and such other lines of coverage as we believe are reasonable in light of our experience to date 
however  this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liabilities that might adversely affect our business or results of operations 
even if any claims brought against us were unsuccessful or without merit  we would still have to defend ourselves against such claims 
any such defenses may be time consuming and costly  and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
changes in the number of medicaid eligibles  or benefits provided to medicaid eligibles or a change in mix of medicaid eligibles could cause our operating results to suffer 
historically  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
however  during such economic downturns  state budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs  benefits and rates 
if this were to happen while our membership was increasing  our results of operations could suffer 
conversely  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve  thereby causing our operating results to suffer 
in either case  in the event that the company experiences a change in product mix to less profitable product lines  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
changes in schip rules restricting eligibility could cause our operating results to suffer 
the states in which we operate have experienced budget deficits 
in florida and texas  the rules governing schip have either recently changed  or may change in the near future  to restrict or limit eligibility for benefits through the imposition of waiting periods  enrollment caps and or new or increased co payments 
these changes in schip eligibility could cause us to experience a net loss in schip membership 
if the states in which we operate continue to restrict or limit schip eligibility  our operating results could suffer 
our inability to integrate  manage and grow our information systems effectively could disrupt our operations 
our operations are significantly dependent on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status and other information 
in november  we signed a software licensing agreement with the trizetto group  inc for their facets extended enterprise tm administrative system facets 
during  we invested in the implementation and testing of facets with a staggered conversion to facets by health plan beginning in and continuing through we estimate that our current claims payment system  without facets  could be at full capacity within the next months 
we currently expect that facets will meet our software needs for an estimated years and will support our long term growth strategies 
however  if we cannot execute a successful system conversion  our operations could be disrupted  which would have a negative impact on our profitability and our ability to grow could be harmed 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we are continually upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems  we could suffer  among other things  from operational disruptions  loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
for example  we acquired a new york health plan as of january   that uses information systems that are different from those used by the rest of our business 
we expect to continue using this system exclusively for our new york plan for a number of months until such time as the new york subsidiary can be successfully integrated onto our systems 
operating that system as a separate information system can be expected to increase our costs in the short term  and there is no assurance that we can effect a seamless transition of the new york plan to a new system 
both the increased operational costs of this system and any difficulties in conversion to a new system could have a negative impact on our profitability 
acts of terrorism could cause our business to suffer 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
if acts of terrorism were to occur in markets in which we operate  our business could suffer 
the results of terrorist acts could lead to higher than expected medical costs  network and information technology disruptions  and other related factors beyond our control  which would cause our business to suffer
