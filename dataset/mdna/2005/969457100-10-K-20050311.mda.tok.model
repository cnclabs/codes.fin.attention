item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of in february  we outlined our planned business strategy in response to the events that significantly impacted the energy sector and our company during late and the plan focused upon migrating to an integrated natural gas business comprised of a strong  but smaller  portfolio of natural gas businesses  reducing debt and increasing our liquidity through asset sales  strategic levels of financing and reductions in operating costs 
the plan provided us with a clear strategy to address near term and medium term debt and liquidity issues  to de leverage the company with the objective of returning to investment grade status and to develop a balance sheet capable of supporting and ultimately growing our remaining businesses 
a component of our plan was to reduce the risk and liquidity requirements of the power segment while realizing the value of power s portfolio 
in  we continued to execute certain components of the plan and substantially completed our plan as outlined in february our results for include the following 
completion of planned asset sales  which resulted in proceeds of approximately million 
replacement of our cash collateralized letter of credit and revolver facility with facilities that do not encumber cash 
reduction of approximately billion of debt through scheduled maturities and early redemptions  including an exchange offer for our feline pacs units 
reduction of risk and liquidity requirements of the power segment 
reduction of approximately million in our combined selling  general and administrative sg a and general corporate expenses 
on june   we announced an agreement with international business machines corporation ibm to aid us in transforming and managing certain areas of our accounting  finance and human resources processes 
under the agreement  ibm will also manage key aspects of our information technology  including enterprise wide infrastructure and application development 
the year agreement began july  and is expected to reduce costs in these areas while maintaining a high quality of service 
current liquidity as a result of the accomplishments noted above  we enter with improved financial condition and liquidity 
to manage our operations and meet unforeseen or extraordinary calls on cash  we expect to maintain liquidity from cash and revolving credit facilities of at least billion 
power business in september  our board of directors approved the decision to retain power and end our efforts to exit that business 
several factors affected our decision to retain the business  including the cash flow expected to be generated by the business power has contracts in place expected to generate cash in amounts that substantially cover its obligations through  the negative effect of depressed wholesale power markets on the marketability of the power segment  and our progress over the last two years in reducing the risk and increasing the certainty of cash flows from long term power contracts 
our strategy is to continue managing this business to minimize financial risk  maximize cash flow and meet contractual commitments 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to begin applying hedge accounting to qualifying derivative contracts  which is expected to reduce power s mark to market earnings volatility 

table of contents outlook for having successfully completed the key components of our february plan to strengthen our finances  we are now in a position to shift from restructuring to disciplined growth 
our plan for includes the following objectives increase focus and disciplined eva based investments in natural gas businesses  continue to steadily improve credit ratios and ratings with the goal of achieving investment grade ratios  continue to reduce risk and liquidity requirements while maximizing cash flow in the power segment  maintain liquidity from cash and revolving credit facilities of at least billion  and generate sustainable growth in eva and shareholder value 
as a result of the strategy to grow our natural gas asset base  we estimate capital and investment expenditures will increase to approximately to billion in compared to million in we expect to fund capital and investment expenditures  debt payments and working capital requirements through cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from operations  which is currently estimated to be between billion and billion in potential risks and or obstacles that could prevent us from achieving these objectives include lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations  volatility of commodity prices  decreased drilling success at exploration production  exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and litigation issues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and general economic and industry downturn 
we continue to address these risks through utilization of commodity hedging strategies  focused efforts to resolve regulatory issues and litigation claims  disciplined investment strategies and maintaining our desired level of at least billion in liquidity from cash and revolving credit facilities 
critical accounting policies estimates our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the selection of these has been discussed with our audit committee 
we believe that the following are the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition derivatives we hold a substantial portfolio of derivative contracts for a variety of purposes 
many of these are designated as hedge positions meaning changes in their fair value are not reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item impacts earnings 
others have not been designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the net change in fair value of these non hedge contracts represents unrealized gains and losses and is recognized in income currently marked to market 
the fair value for each of these derivative contracts is determined based on the nature of the transaction and the market in which transactions are executed 
we also incorporate assumptions and judgments about counterparty performance and credit considerations in our determination of fair value 
certain contracts are executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets where quoted prices in active markets may exist 
transactions are also executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets for which market prices may exist  but which may be relatively inactive with limited price transparency 
as a result  the ability to determine the fair value of the contract is 
table of contents more subjective than if an independent third party quote were available 
a limited number of transactions are also executed for which quoted market prices are not available 
determining fair value for these contracts involves assumptions and judgments when estimating prices at which market participants would transact if a market existed for the contract or transaction 
we estimate the fair value of these various derivative contracts by incorporating information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets  quoted prices in less active markets  and other market fundamental analysis 
the estimated fair value of all these derivative contracts is continually subject to change as the underlying energy commodity market changes and as management s assumptions and judgments change 
additional discussion of the accounting for energy contracts at fair value is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  energy trading activities  and item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
oil and gas producing activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
estimated natural gas and oil reserves and or forward market prices for oil and gas are a significant part of our financial calculations 
following are examples of how these estimates affect financial results 
an increase decrease in estimated proved oil and gas reserves can reduce increase our unit of production depreciation  depletion and amortization rates 
changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties 
these projected future cash flows are used o to estimate the fair value of oil and gas properties for purposes of assessing them for impairment  and o to estimate the fair value of the exploration production reporting unit for purposes of assessing its goodwill for impairment 
certain estimated reserves are used as collateral to secure financing 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
after being estimated internally  percent of our reserve estimates are either audited or prepared by independent experts 
the data may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates could occur from time to time 
a reasonably likely revision of our reserve estimates is not expected to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill 
however  reserve estimate revisions would impact our depreciation and depletion expense prospectively 
for example  a change of approximately percent in oil and gas reserves for each basin would change our annual depreciation  depletion and amortization expense between approximately million and million 
the actual impact would depend on the specific basins impacted and whether the change resulted from proved developed  proved undeveloped or a combination of these reserve categories 
forward market prices include estimates of prices for periods that extend beyond those with quoted market prices 
this forward market price information is consistent with that generally used in evaluating drilling decisions and acquisition plans 
these market prices for future periods impact the production economics underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period thus impacting our estimates 
a reasonably likely unfavorable change in the forward price curve is not expected to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill 
contingent liabilities we record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies  including environmental matters  when we assess that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which new or different facts or information become known or 
table of contents circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
liabilities for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions and estimates  and advice of legal counsel  engineers  or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
as new developments occur or more information becomes available  it is possible that our assumptions and estimates in these matters will change 
changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes different from our current assumptions and estimates could materially affect future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis and from tax carry forwards generated in the current and prior years 
we evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that may not be realizable 
this evaluation considers tax planning strategies  including assumptions about the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december   we have million of deferred tax assets for which a million valuation allowance has been established 
when assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered forecasts of future company performance  the estimated impact of potential asset dispositions  and our ability and intent to execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax carryovers 
based on our projections  we believe that it is probable that we can utilize our year end federal tax net operating loss carryovers and capital loss carryovers prior to their expiration 
we do not expect to be able to utilize million  or approximately million of tax benefit  of the charitable contribution carryovers expiring in the remaining million of charitable contribution carryovers are expected to be utilized prior to their expiration 
we also do not expect to be able to utilize million of foreign deferred tax assets related to carryovers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the tax carryovers 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from those recorded  as influenced by potential changes in jurisdictional income tax laws and the circumstances surrounding the actual realization of related tax assets 
we frequently face challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the liability associated with our various filing positions  we record a liability for probable tax contingencies 
the ultimate disposition of these contingencies could have a material impact on net cash flows 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or were required to pay amounts in excess of our accrued liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
impairment of long lived assets and investments we evaluate our long lived assets and investments for impairment when we believe events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of certain long lived assets or the decline in carrying value of an investment is other than temporary 
in addition to those long lived assets and investments for which impairment charges were recorded see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements  certain others were reviewed for which no impairment was required 
our computations utilized judgments and assumptions in the following areas the probability that we would sell an asset or continue to hold and use it  undiscounted future cash flows if a long lived asset is held for use  estimated fair value of the asset  estimated sales proceeds if an asset is sold  form and timing of the asset disposition  counterparty performance considerations under contracted sales transactions  and for investments that are impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary 

table of contents an indicator of impairment relating to our canadian olefins assets was identified during it is possible that our investment in these assets may not be recoverable without modifications to or a renegotiation of key terms in an off gas processing agreement 
therefore  we performed recoverability tests that considered a possible sale of the assets versus successful renegotiation of the processing agreements 
our computations utilized judgments and assumptions in the following areas varying terms of renegotiated contracts  commodity pricing  probability weighting of different scenarios  and estimated sales proceeds if the assets were sold 
after applying probability weightings to the various scenarios  we determined that the assets did not require impairment at december  a critical assumption in our impairment analysis was the valuation of future contract terms in the related processing agreement 
under the most likely scenario  a decrease of approximately percent or more in our estimate of the contract valuation would likely result in an impairment 
our gulf liquids new river project llc gulf liquids operations are classified as held for sale at december  these assets were written down to the then estimated fair value less costs to sell at december  additional analysis during resulted in an impairment of million 
we estimated fair value based on a probability weighted analysis that considered sales price negotiations  salvage value estimates  and discounted future cash flows 
this estimate involved significant judgment  including commodity pricing  probability weighting of the different scenarios  and range of estimated sales proceeds  salvage value and future cash flows 
the estimated cash flows from the various scenarios ranged from approximately million above to million below our estimated fair value at december  
table of contents pension and postretirement obligations we have employee benefit plans that include pension and other postretirement benefits 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are determined by a third party actuary and are impacted by various estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include the expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  expected rate of compensation increase  health care cost trend rates  and employee demographics including retirement age and mortality 
we review these assumptions annually and make adjustments as needed 
the assumptions utilized to compute expense and the benefit obligations are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents the estimated increase decrease in pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations resulting from a one percentage point change in these assumptions 
benefit expense benefit obligation one percentage one percentage one percentage one percentage point increase point decrease point increase point decrease millions pension benefits discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase other postretirement benefits discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumed health care cost trend rate the expected long term rates of return on plan assets are determined by combining a review of historical returns realized within the portfolio  the investment strategy included in the plans investment policy statement  and the capital market projections provided by our independent investment consultant for the asset classifications in which the portfolio is invested as well as the target weightings of each asset classification 
these rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions  but because they are long term in nature  short term market swings do not significantly impact the rates 
changes to our target asset allocation would also impact these rates 
the discount rates are used to discount future benefit obligations to today s dollars 
decreases in this rate cause the obligation and related expense to increase 
the discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash flows as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions which affect interest rates on long term high quality corporate bonds 
the expected rate of compensation increase represents average long term salary increases 
an increase in this rate causes pension obligation and expense to increase 
the assumed health care cost trend rates used by the actuaries are based on our actual historical cost rates and then adjusted for expected changes in the health care industry 
taps quality bank one of our subsidiaries  williams alaska petroleum  inc wapi is actively engaged in administrative litigation being conducted jointly by the ferc and the regulatory commission of alaska rca concerning the trans alaska pipeline system taps quality bank 
primary issues being litigated include the appropriate valuation of the naphtha  heavy distillate  vacuum gas oil and residual product cuts within the 
table of contents taps quality bank as well as the appropriate retroactive effects of the determinations 
due to the sale of wapi s interests on march   we are no longer responsible for paying into the quality bank 
we are responsible for any liability that existed as of that date including potential liability for any retroactive payments that might be awarded in these proceedings for the period prior to march  the ferc and rca presiding administrative law judges rendered their joint and individual initial decisions during the third quarter of the initial decisions set forth methodologies for determining the valuations of the product cuts under review and also approved the retroactive application of the approved methodologies for the heavy distillate and residual product cuts see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on our computation and assessment of the initial decisions by both the ferc and rca  we recorded an increase to our accrual of approximately million in the third quarter of because the application of certain aspects of the initial decisions is subject to interpretation  the exercise of significant judgment is required to calculate the impact of the order 
we have calculated the reasonably possible impact of the decisions  if fully adopted by the ferc and rca  to result in additional exposure to us of approximately million more than we have accrued at december  therefore  the final outcome could potentially be materially different than we have estimated and accrued 
recent accounting standards in december  the fasb issued revised sfas no 
 share based payment 
the statement requires that compensation cost for all share based awards to employees be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we intend to adopt the revised statement as of the interim reporting period beginning july  the statement requires an option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock awards 
we are evaluating the appropriateness of several option pricing models  including a black scholes model and a lattice model such as a binomial model 
application of these two models could result in different estimates of fair value with resulting differences in compensation costs

our management  after consultation with our independent auditor  concluded that the effect of the previous accounting treatment was not material to and prior periods and the trend of earnings 
the billion increase in costs and operating expenses is due primarily to the effect of reporting certain costs on a gross basis at power and midstream  as discussed above 
costs increased billion at power and billion at midstream due primarily to the effect of eitf contributing to the increase at our midstream segment is million attributable to rising market prices for natural gas used to replace the heating value of ngls extracted at their gas processing facilities

results of operations segments we are currently organized into the following segments power  gas pipeline  exploration production  midstream and other 
other primarily consists of corporate operations and certain continuing operations formerly included in the previously reported international and petroleum services segments 
our management currently evaluates performance based on segment profit loss from operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior period amounts have been restated to reflect all segment changes 
the following discussions relate to the results of operations of our segments 
power overview of power s operating results were significantly influenced by past efforts to exit from the power business and the effect of price changes on derivative contracts 
prior to september  power continued to focus on terminating or selling all or portions of its portfolio  maximizing cash flow  reducing risk  and managing existing contractual commitments 
these efforts were consistent with our decision to sell all or portions of power s portfolio 
the decrease in revenues  costs and sg a expenses in reflects our lower levels of business activity pursuant to our past efforts to exit the power business 

table of contents in september  we announced our decision to continue operating the power business and cease efforts to exit that business 
as a result  subsequent to september  power continued to focus on its objectives of minimizing financial risk  maximizing cash flow  meeting contractual commitments and providing functions that support our natural gas businesses 
in addition  power began executing new contracts to hedge its portfolio 
as a result of our past intent to exit the power business  power s derivative contracts did not previously qualify for hedge accounting 
therefore  we reported changes in the forward fair value of our derivative contracts in earnings as unrealized gains or losses 
however  with the decision to retain the business  power s derivative contracts became eligible for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas and power elected hedge accounting on a prospective basis beginning october  for certain qualifying derivative contracts 
under cash flow hedge accounting  to the extent that the hedges are effective  prospective changes in the forward fair value of the hedges are reported as changes in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet  and then reclassified to earnings when the underlying hedged transactions ie power sales and gas purchases affect earnings 
key factors that influence power s financial condition and operating performance include the following prices of power and natural gas  including changes in the margin between power and natural gas prices  changes in market liquidity  including changes in the ability to effectively hedge the portfolio  changes in power and natural gas price volatility  changes in interest rates  changes in the regulatory environment  changes in power and natural gas supply and demand  and the inability of counterparties to perform under contractual obligations due to their own credit constraints 
outlook for in  power intends to service its customers needs while increasing the certainty of cash flows from its long term contracts 
as power continues to apply hedge accounting in  its future earnings may be less volatile 
however  not all of power s derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting 
power will continue to report changes in the fair value of those remaining non hedge contracts in earnings as unrealized gains or losses 
in addition  the ineffective portion of the change in the forward fair value of qualifying hedges will also continue to be reported in earnings 
because the derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting have significant fair value that has been recognized as unrealized gains or losses prior to october   the amounts recognized in future earnings under hedge accounting will not necessarily align with the expected cash flows to be realized from the settlement of those derivatives 
therefore  it is expected that future earnings will reflect losses from underlying transactions that have been hedged by the derivatives  but will not reflect the corresponding offsetting positive value from the hedges since such positive value has already been recognized in prior periods 
however  cash flows from power s portfolio continue to reflect the net amount from both the hedged transactions and the hedges 
even with the adoption of hedge accounting  some variability in power s earnings will remain as a result of market movements of commodity based derivatives held for trading purposes or which did not qualify for hedge accounting  and 
table of contents ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges primarily caused by locational differences between the hedging derivative and the hedged item  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties and the hedging derivative contract having a fair value upon designation

the billion decrease in revenues includes an approximately billion decrease in realized revenues partially offset by a million increase in forward unrealized mark to market gains 
realized revenues represent revenue from the sale of commodities or completion of energy related services  and gains and losses from the net financial settlement of derivative contracts 
the approximately billion decrease in realized revenues is primarily due to an approximately billion decrease in power and natural gas realized revenues and an million decrease in crude and refined products realized revenues 
power and natural gas realized revenues decreased primarily due to a percent decrease in power sales volumes  partially offset by a five percent increase in power sales prices 
sales volumes decreased because power did not replace certain long term physical contracts that expired or were terminated in  primarily due to a lack of market liquidity and past efforts to reduce our commitment to the power business 
in addition  results for include a realized gain of million based on the terms of an agreement to terminate a derivative contract 
in addition  during  revenues include the correction of the accounting treatment previously applied to certain third party derivative contracts during and  resulting in the recognition of approximately million in revenues attributable to prior periods 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
additionally  power and natural gas revenues in include a million reduction for increased power rate refunds owed to the state of california as the result of ferc rulings 
crude and refined products revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of the crude gathering business in  the sale of the refined products business in and the past efforts to exit this line of business 
net forward unrealized mark to market gains and losses represent changes in the fair values of derivative contracts with a future settlement or delivery date

table of contents gains of million  an increase of million from the increase in unrealized gains is due to a million increase associated with power and gas contracts  partially offset by an million decrease in crude and refined products and a million decrease in the interest rate portfolio 
the increase in power and gas primarily results from a greater increase associated with near term natural gas forward prices in than in also contributing to the increase was the absence in of unrealized losses of approximately million recognized in first quarter on contracts for which we elected the normal purchases and sales exception in second quarter another factor contributing to the increase was the impact of cash flow hedge accounting  which was prospectively applied to certain of power s forecasted transactions beginning october  a net loss of million related to the effective portion of the hedges was reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the decrease in crude and refined products primarily results from the sale of the crude gathering business in  the sale of the refined products business in and the past efforts to exit this line of business 
these activities led to a significantly smaller derivative position in than in which resulted in lower unrealized mark to market gains 
the decrease in the interest rate portfolio is due primarily to a decrease in forward interest rates in first quarter compared to a slight increase in first quarter the billion decrease in power s costs is primarily due to a decrease in power and natural gas costs of approximately billion and a decrease in crude and refined products costs of million 
power and natural gas costs decreased primarily due to a percent decrease in power purchase volumes  partially offset by a two percent increase in power prices 
a million reduction to certain contingent loss accruals in and a million loss for other contingencies in  both associated with power marketing activities in california during and  contributed to the decrease in costs discussed above 
costs in also reflect a million payment made to terminate a non derivative power sales contract  which partially offsets the decrease in power and natural gas costs 
crude and refined products costs decreased primarily due to the sale of the crude gathering business in  the sale of the refined products business in  and other past efforts to exit this line of business 
the million decrease in sg a expenses is largely due to a million decline in compensation expense  primarily as a result of staff reductions in prior years combined with the accelerated recognition of million in of certain deferred compensation arrangements 
in addition  a million reduction of allowance for bad debts resulting from the settlement with certain california utilities and the absence of a million bad debt charge associated with a termination settlement in also contributed to the decrease

the billion increase in revenues includes an approximately billion increase in realized revenues and a million increase in forward unrealized mark to market gains 
realized revenues increased primarily as a result of the implementation of eitf on january  eitf impacts how power present revenues and costs from certain transactions in the statement of operations

revenues for include a realized gain of million based on the terms of an agreement to terminate a derivative contract 
additionally  during  power corrected the accounting treatment previously applied to certain third party derivative contracts during and  resulting in the recognition in of approximately million in revenues attributable to prior periods 
this matter was initially disclosed in our form q for the second quarter of refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
realized revenues in also include a million loss for increased power rate refunds owed to the state of california as the result of ferc rulings  which partially offsets the general increase discussed above 
increased power supply in the mid continent and eastern regions contributed to lower prices received on power sales in  which further offsets the general increase in realized revenues 
eitf also affects forward unrealized mark to market gains 
before the adoption of eitf  power reported the fair value of all its energy contracts  energy related contracts and inventory on the balance 
table of contents sheet 
power reported changes in the fair value of the items  or forward unrealized mark to market gains  from period to period in revenues 
examples of derivative and non derivative contracts are as follows derivative contracts non derivative contracts forward purchase and sale contracts spot purchase and sale contracts futures contracts transportation contracts option contracts storage contracts swap agreements tolling agreements power conversion contracts full requirement or load serving contracts power sales contracts in which we supply all of the customer s requirements for power in  power continued to reflect the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in revenues and segment profit 
however  for non derivative contracts  power does not recognize revenue until commodities are delivered or services are completed 
the million increase in forward unrealized mark to market gains includes a million increase in the power and natural gas portfolios and a million increase in the interest rate portfolio  partially offset by a million decrease in the crude and refined products portfolio 
power and natural gas forward unrealized mark to market gains in reflect the impact of decreased forward power prices on net power sales contracts derivative contracts and increased forward gas prices on net gas purchase contracts derivative contracts 
increased power supply in the mid continent and eastern us significantly contributed to the decrease in forward power prices 
unrealized mark to market gains in were lower primarily due to the impact of decreased margins between forward power prices and the estimated cost to produce the power on tolling contracts non derivative contracts 
the decline in volatility of the power and natural gas markets in also contributed to a decrease in fair value of tolling contracts within certain of our tolling portfolios as it does other option contracts 
tolling contracts possess characteristics of options since we have the right but not the obligation to request the plant owner to convert natural gas to power 
results in also reflect an unfavorable million valuation adjustment on certain non derivative power sale contracts 
quotes received during sales efforts in resulted in the valuation adjustment 
the effect of decreased interest rates on power and natural gas derivative and non derivative contracts in partially offsets the general increase discussed above 
as interest rates decreased in  the overall fair value of these commodity contracts increased 
further offsetting the general increase is a lack of origination in in  we recognized million of power and natural gas revenues by originating new contracts  a portion of which realized during the favorable net effect of approximately million resulting from a settlement with the state of california in also partially offsets the increase in power and natural gas forward unrealized mark to market gains 
the million reflects the increase in fair value on power sales contracts with the california department of water resources  which resulted from a restructuring of the contracts and the improved credit standing of the counterparty 
the increase in the interest rate portfolio reflects a lesser decrease in forward interest rates in than in the decrease in crude and refined products portfolios reflects a lack of origination in in  power recognized million of forward unrealized mark to market gains within the petroleum products portfolio by originating new contracts  a portion of which realized in the billion increase in costs is primarily due to the implementation of eitf as discussed above 
as a result of eitf  power now reports certain purchases in costs instead of reporting them as reduction of revenues 
the increase in costs caused by eitf does not affect gross margin or segment profit 
also included in costs is a million loss for other contingencies related to our power marketing activities in the state of california 
the reduced focus on the power business resulted in further employee reductions in we employed approximately employees at the end of compared to approximately at the end of this decrease in employees was a primary factor in the million  or percent  decrease in sg a expenses 
the million variance in other income expense net is primarily due to power terminating or selling certain contracts and other assets  resulting in losses in and gains in in  power 
table of contents terminated certain power related capital projects  which resulted in million of impairments 
power also recorded a million impairment in from the january sale of the worthington generation facility 
in  power sold a non derivative energy trading contract resulting in a million gain on sale 
power also sold an interest in certain investments accounted for under the equity method in for a gain of million 
a million goodwill impairment in compared to a million goodwill impairment in also contributed to the increase in other income expense net 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other factors offset the increase in other income expense net 
in  power recognized a million impairment on a power generating facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
power also reached a settlement with the commodity futures trading commission as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  resulting in a charge of million 
in addition  power recognized million of impairment charges associated with the aux sable partnership investment 
finally  power recorded accruals of million for power marketing activities in california during and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the million increase in segment profit is primarily due to an increase in realized revenues and forward unrealized mark to market gains that were greater than the increase in costs 
further impacting this increase are the changes in other income expense net and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed above 
gas pipeline overview of gas pipeline s interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc and as such  our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  and the extension  enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting  among other things  are subject to regulation 
the rates are established through the ferc s ratemaking process 
changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have little impact on revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates 
effective june   and due in part to ferc order  management and decision making control of certain regulated gas gathering assets was transferred from our midstream segment to our gas pipeline segment 
consequently  the results of operations were similarly reclassified 
all prior periods reflect these classifications 
northwest pipeline in western washington in december  we received an amended corrective action order acao from the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety ops regarding a segment of one of our natural gas pipelines in western washington 
the pipeline experienced two breaks in and we subsequently idled the pipeline segment until its integrity could be assured 
by june  we had successfully completed our hydrostatic testing program and returned to service miles of the miles of pipe affected by the acao 
that effort has restored thousand dekatherms per day mdt d of the mdt d of idled capacity and is anticipated to be adequate to meet most market conditions 
the decision to idle the pipeline has not had a significant impact on our ability to meet market demand to date 
the restored facilities will be monitored and tested as necessary until they are ultimately replaced 
as of december   approximately million has been spent on testing and remediation  including approximately million related to one segment of pipe that we determined not to return to service and therefore was written off in the second quarter of we estimate additional testing and remediation costs of up to million 
on october  we received a notice of probable violation nopv from ops 
under the provisions of the nopv  ops has issued a preliminary civil penalty of  for exceeding the pressure restriction on one of the segments covered under the original cao 
this penalty was accrued in the third 
table of contents quarter of the incident occurred on july  and did not occur as part of normal operations  but in preparation for running an internal inspection tool to test the integrity of the line 
the operating pressure dictated by the original cao was exceeded for approximately three hours due to the mechanical failure of an overpressure device and we immediately reported the incident to the ops 
there was no impact on pipeline facilities  and no additional sections of the pipeline were affected 
following the incident  new protocols were adopted to ensure that a similar situation would not occur in the future 
we requested a hearing on the proposed ops civil penalty  which was held on december  we expect ops to issue its decision in the near future 
as required by ops  we plan to replace the pipeline s entire capacity by november to meet long term demands 
we conducted a reverse open season to determine whether any existing customers were willing to relinquish or reduce their capacity commitments to allow us to reduce the scope of pipeline replacement facilities  which resulted in mdt d of capacity being relinquished and incorporated into the replacement project 
on november   we filed with the ferc a certificate of application for the capacity replacement project  including construction of approximately miles of inch pipeline and  net horsepower of additional compression at two existing compressor stations and abandonment of approximately miles of the existing inch pipeline 
the estimated net cost of the capacity replacement project included in the filing is approximately million 
the majority of these costs will be spent in and we anticipate filing a rate case to recover the capitalized costs relating to restoration and replacement facilities following the in service date of the replacement facilities 
momentum phase ii in february  transco placed an expansion into service increasing capacity on its natural gas system by mdt d 
the expansion provides additional firm transportation capacity to serve transco s southeastern market area

gulfstream now has the capacity of approximately billion cubic feet per day 
the cost for phase ii of the project is estimated at million 
central new jersey expansion project in february  transco received authorization from the ferc to construct and operate the central new jersey expansion project on its natural gas pipeline system 
the expansion will provide an additional mdt d of firm natural gas transportation service in transco s northeastern market area 
the estimated cost of the project is million

revenue also increased due to million higher commodity revenue on transco 
partially offsetting these increases was the absence in of million of revenue from reductions in the rate refund liabilities and other adjustments associated with a rate case settlement on transco in and million lower storage demand revenues in due to lower storage rates in connection with transco s rate proceedings that became effective in late cost and operating expenses increased million  or three percent  due primarily to million higher depreciation expense due to additional property  plant and equipment placed into service and million higher state sales and use  ad valorem and franchise taxes 
these increases were partially offset by million lower fuel expense on transco  resulting primarily from pricing differentials on the volumes of gas used in operation 
general and administrative costs decreased million  or percent  due primarily to the absence in of million of early retirement pension costs recorded in and other employee related benefits costs associated with reduced employee levels as well as the absence of a million write off in of capitalized software development costs resulting from cancellation of a project 
other income expense net in includes a million charge at northwest pipeline to write off capitalized software development costs for a service delivery system 
subsequent to the implementation of the same system at transco in the second quarter of and a determination of the unique and additional programming requirements that would be needed to complete the system at northwest pipeline  management determined that the system would not be implemented at northwest pipeline 
other income expense net in also includes million of income at transco due to a partial reduction of accrued liabilities for claims associated with certain producers as a result of settlements and court rulings 
other income expense net in includes a million charge associated with a ferc penalty see investigations related to natural gas storage inventory in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a million loss on the sale of the cove point facility 

table of contents summarized changes in gas pipeline s segment profit the million  or four percent  increase in segment profit  which includes equity earnings and income loss from investments  is due to the following favorable items the million increase in revenues  the million decrease in general and administrative costs  the absence of a million ferc charge discussed above  and the absence of the million write off of gas pipeline s investment in a cancelled pipeline project and a million loss on the sale of gas pipeline s percent ownership interest in alliance pipeline 
both items were included in income loss from investment  which is included in investing income loss 
these increases to segment profit were partially offset by the following million lower equity earnings  the million charge at northwest pipeline to write off capitalized software costs discussed previously  the million higher operating costs  and the absence of a million gain on the sale of our general partnership interest in northern border partners  lp the million decrease to equity earnings reflects million lower equity earnings from our investment in the gulfstream pipeline  the absence of a million benefit in related to the contractual construction completion fee received by an equity affiliate and the absence of million of equity earnings following the october sale of gas pipeline s percent ownership in alliance pipeline 
the lower earnings from our investment in the gulfstream pipeline were primarily due to the absence in of interest capitalized on internally generated funds as allowed by the ferc during construction 
the gulfstream pipeline was placed into service during second quarter exploration production overview of in  our strategy focused on expanding our development drilling program in order to surpass results experienced in prior years 
we achieved this goal consistently throughout with our major accomplishments including the following we increased daily production volumes by percent from the beginning of the year 
the domestic average daily production for the quarter ending december  was approximately million cubic feet of gas equivalent mmcfe compared to mmcfe for the same period in we increased our development drilling program throughout  surpassing annual drilling capital expenditures prior to and more than doubling the expenditures occurring in capital expenditures for domestic drilling activity in were approximately million compared to approximately million in we improved the timing and efficiency of our drilling cycle  particularly in the piceance basin  by reducing the number of days to drill from eighteen to sixteen  thereby increasing the number of wells drilled during a given time period 
the benefit of the higher production volumes was partially offset by increased operating costs and lower net average realized prices which were the result of increased derivative hedge losses in the increase in operating costs was the result of escalated overall production and maintenance activities among oil and gas producers  which caused service companies to increase their fees 

table of contents outlook for our expectations for include a continuing development drilling program in our key basins with an increase in activity in the piceance  san juan  and arkoma basins with associated planned capital expenditures of million to million in  and increasing our fourth quarter average daily domestic production level of mmcfe per day by at least ten percent by the end of approximately mmcfe of our forecasted daily domestic production of to mmcfe per day is hedged at prices that average per mmcfe at a basin level 
in addition  we have approximately mmcfe of our daily estimated january through march production hedged in nymex collar agreements that have an average floor price of per mmcfe and an average ceiling price of per mmcfe at a basin level 
risks that we may not be able to accomplish our objectives include drilling rig availability as well as obtaining permits as planned for drilling 
year over year operating results the following discussions of the year over year results primarily relate to our continuing operations 
however  the results do include those operations that were sold during or that did not qualify for discontinued operations reporting 
the operations classified as discontinued operations are the properties in the hugoton and raton basins

the million  or less than one percent  decrease in revenues is primarily due to the absence of million in income realized during from derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting  partially offset by an increase in domestic production revenues of million during the increase in domestic production revenues primarily results from million higher revenues associated with a nine percent increase in production volumes partially offset by million lower revenues associated with a four percent decrease in net realized average prices for production sold 
net realized average prices include the effect of hedge positions which were at prices below market levels 
the increase in production volumes primarily reflects an increase in the number of producing wells resulting from our successful drilling program 
we expect production volumes to continue to increase in as our development drilling program continues 
to manage the risk and volatility associated with the ownership of producing gas properties  we enter into derivative forward sales contracts that economically lock in a price relating to a portion of our future production 
approximately percent of domestic production in was hedged at a weighted average price of per mmcfe at a basin level 
these hedges are executed with our power segment which  in turn  executes offsetting derivative contracts with unrelated third parties 
generally  power bears the counterparty performance risks associated with unrelated third parties 
hedging decisions are made considering our overall commodity risk exposure and are not executed independently by exploration production 

table of contents total costs and expenses increased million  which includes the absence of million in net gains on sales of assets occurring in the remaining increase in costs and expenses primarily reflects million higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense primarily as a result of increased production volumes as well as increased capitalized drilling costs reflective of greater levels of drilling and increased prices for tubular goods occurring in response to supply conditions in the worldwide steel market  million higher lease operating expense associated with the higher number of producing wells and an increase in well maintenance activities  higher labor and fuel costs  and an increase in overhead payments to another operator  million higher operating taxes due primarily to increased production volumes sold  a million gain attributable to the sales of securities  associated with a coal seam royalty trust  that were purchased for resale  and a million loss provision regarding an ownership dispute on prior period production 
the million decrease in segment profit is due primarily to the absence of million in net gains on sales of assets occurring in  the increase in operating expenses  and the loss provision of million relating to an ownership dispute on prior period production partially offset by the million gain attributable to the sales of securities associated with our coal seam royalty trust that were purchased for resale 
segment profit also includes million and million related to international activities for and  respectively 
this increase is primarily driven by the improved operating results of apco argentina 
vs 
the million  or nine percent decrease in revenues is due primarily to million lower production revenues due to lower production volumes as the result of property sales and reduced drilling activities and million lower other revenues primarily due to the absence in of deferred income relating to transactions in prior years that transferred certain economic benefits to a third party 
the decrease in domestic production revenues reflects million associated with an eleven percent decrease in net domestic production volumes  partially offset by million higher revenues from increased net realized average prices for production 
net realized average prices include the effect of hedge positions 
the decrease in production volumes primarily results from the sales of properties in and and the impact of reduced drilling activity 
drilling activity was lower in the january through august period of due to our capital constraints 
during the third quarter  drilling activities on our retained properties began to increase and by the fourth quarter of returned to levels more consistent with levels 
approximately percent of domestic production in was hedged using the same methodology discussed above 
total costs and expenses increased million primarily due to million lower net gains on sales of assets in as compared to the remaining variance in costs and expenses primarily reflects million lower exploration expenses reflecting our focus of the company on developing proved properties while reducing exploratory activities  million lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense primarily as a result of lower production volumes  million lower selling  general and administrative expense  and million higher operating taxes due primarily to higher market prices 
the million decrease in segment profit is due primarily to million lower net gains on sales of assets in as compared to  as discussed above

table of contents midstream gas liquids overview of in  we continued to expand our midstream operations where we have large scale assets that are positioned in growth basins and to divest less strategic assets 
consistent with this plan  we placed into service additional infrastructure in the deepwater offshore area of the gulf of mexico and expanded the opal gas processing facility in wyoming 
in the deepwater gulf of mexico  the devils tower production handling facility  the canyon chief gas pipeline  and the mountaineer oil pipeline began flowing product in may  while the gunnison oil pipeline volumes increased throughout the year 
our ongoing focus is to develop and operate large scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and provide the highest level of reliability to our customers 
the following factors impacted our business during substantial completion of our asset sales goals in  we completed our asset sales program 
the july sale of the western canadian straddle plants represented our most significant divestiture of yielding approximately million in us funds 
the estimated pre tax gain on sale of approximately million was recognized in discontinued operations in the third quarter 
favorable commodity price margins our natural gas liquids ngl margins benefited from a significant increase in crude oil prices and an increased demand for petrochemical feedstocks such as ethane and propane 
as indicated in the graph below  our quarterly margins exceeded the historical five year annual average throughout the second half of our gas processing facilities produced strong financial results as a result of near record high ngl margins and operated at full capacity throughout most of the year 
our olefins businesses also benefited from favorable commodity prices associated with additional demand for ethylene and propylene 
bar chart impact of hurricane ivan in september  portions of our gulf coast operations were interrupted by hurricane ivan 
the mobile bay gas processing plant  canyon station and devils tower platforms were located in the path of the hurricane and incurred varying levels of damage 
hurricane ivan caused temporary shut downs of both our facilities and producers facilities  which reduced product flows resulting in lower segment profit of approximately million in the majority of the repairs related to hurricane ivan are expected to be covered by our insurance 
repairs to the devils tower facility were completed in october while our other impacted assets were returned to service by the end of september however  product flows to our deepwater 
table of contents facilities were reduced significantly during the fourth quarter as incidental damage to our customers facilities was being repaired 
gulf liquids reclassification to continuing operations during fourth quarter  we reclassified the operations of gulf liquids to continuing operations within our midstream segment in accordance with eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations  eitf 
under the provisions of eitf  gulf liquids no longer qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations based on management s expectation that we will continue to have significant commercial activity with the disposed entity 
all periods presented reflect this restatement 
gulf liquids insurance arbitration award during fourth quarter  an arbitration panel awarded gulf liquids million  plus interest of million 
prior to this judgment  the insurer had disputed coverage of certain financial assurances provided to gulf liquids on multiple construction contracts 
compliance with ferc order effective june   and due in part to our response to ferc order  management and decision making control of certain regulated gas gathering assets was transferred from our midstream segment to our gas pipeline segment 
we also requested a waiver from the ferc regarding compliance with ferc order for the operation of discovery gas transmission and black marlin assets 
in july  the ferc granted a partial waiver allowing our midstream segment to continue to manage these assets without subjecting midstream to energy affiliate status under ferc order in order to comply with the remaining provisions of the ferc order  we determined it was necessary to transfer management of our equity investment in the aux sable processing plant to our power segment 
this transfer was effective september  all periods presented reflect these classifications 
outlook for the following factors could impact our business in and beyond 
as evidenced in recent years  natural gas and crude oil markets are highly volatile 
although ngl margins earned at our gas processing plants in were very favorable  we expect unit margins in to trend downward towards historical averages 
ngl production volumes at our facilities are expected to be at or above levels of previous years due to continued strong drilling activities in our core basins 
we are planning to expand our investment in the wamsutter gathering system in and our olefins unit margins were also favorable in while we believe this trend should continue in the near term  olefins margins are highly volatile and levels in are not necessarily indicative of levels expected for however  a fire at a canadian oil sands facility that supplies us with off gas feedstock reduced our throughput in january we expect this throughput reduction to continue through late  partially offsetting the expected favorable margins 
continued growth in the deepwater areas of the gulf of mexico is expected to contribute to  and become a larger component of  our future segment revenues and segment profit 
we expect these additional fee based revenues to lower our proportionate exposure to commodity price risks 
we continue efforts to sell our gulf liquids refinery off gas and propylene splitting business in louisiana and anticipate closing by the end of the second quarter of 
table of contents period over period results years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit loss domestic gathering processing venezuela other total vs 
the million increase in midstream s revenues is primarily the result of favorable commodity prices on our gas processing and olefins businesses  largely offset by lower trading revenues resulting from the fourth quarter sale of our wholesale propane business 
revenues associated with production of ngls increased million  of which million is due to higher volumes and million is due to higher ngl prices 
olefins revenues increased million as a result of both higher market prices and higher volumes 
in addition  our deepwater service revenues increased million due to the addition of new infrastructure 
other factors affecting total revenues include approximately billion in lower trading revenues resulting from the fourth quarter sale of our wholesale propane business  partially offset by a million increase as the result of marketing ngls on behalf of our customers 
before  our purchases of customers ngls were netted within revenues 
in  these purchases of customers ngls are included in costs and operating expenses which substantially offset the change in revenues 
of this million increase  approximately million results from the difference in financial reporting presentation  the remaining increase is due to higher ngl volumes and prices 
also partially offsetting the lower trading revenues is million in higher crude sales associated with the startup of one of our deepwater pipelines  which is offset in costs and operating expenses below 
costs and operating expenses decreased million primarily as a result of approximately billion in lower trading costs due to the sale of our wholesale propane business in this decline was partially offset by million in higher costs related to the production of ngls and million in higher costs related to the production of olefins products 
these costs increased as a result of both the higher production volumes noted above and the higher prices for natural gas and olefins feedstock 
maintenance and depreciation expenses increased million in large part due to newly constructed deepwater assets 
similar to the impact to revenues  total costs and operating expenses increased million due to the marketing of ngls on behalf of customers and million in higher crude purchases related to the same deepwater pipeline mentioned above 
the million increase in midstream segment profit includes the million gain from the gulf liquids insurance arbitration award in and the absence of a million impairment charge in related to these same assets both of which are included in other income expense net  within operating income 
the remaining increase in segment profit is primarily due to higher ngl and olefins production volume and unit margins  higher service revenues  and reduced general and administrative expenses 
these increases are partially offset by higher operating expenses and asset impairment charges 
a more detailed analysis of segment profit of midstream s various operations is presented below 
domestic gathering processing the million increase in domestic gathering and processing segment profit includes a million increase in the west region and an million increase in the gulf coast region 

table of contents the million increase in our west region s segment profit reflects higher ngl volume and unit margins offset by lower fee revenues and higher operating expenses 
the significant components of this increase are explained below 
our west region s net ngl margins for increased million compared to the same period in net ngl margins are defined as ngl revenues less btu replacement cost  plant fuel  transportation and fractionation expense 
average per unit ngl margins increased percent and comprised million of the increase in ngl margins 
as a result of the higher spread between the prices of ngls and natural gas  our west plants operated at near capacity and produced percent higher volumes comprising the remaining million increase in ngl net margins 
the million increase in our gulf coast region s segment profit is due to higher ngl margins partially offset by lower fee revenues and higher depreciation expense 
the significant components of the net increase include the following 
net ngl margins at our gulf coast gas processing plants increased million due to a percent increase in ngl production volumes which represented million of the increase in margins 
the significantly higher ngl volumes were driven by the favorable spread between ngl and natural gas prices coupled with the recently completed production handling infrastructure flowing additional deepwater gas production to our plants 
per unit margins in the gulf coast region increased percent and comprised the remaining million increase in net ngl margins 
segment profit from our deepwater assets declined million primarily due to million in higher costs associated with assets placed into service in the first two quarters of partially offset by million in higher services revenues 
the increase in revenues includes million in incremental revenues from newly constructed assets partially offset by a million decline in handling and gathering revenues due to lower production volumes on other deepwater assets substantially resulting from the effects of hurricane ivan 
while revenues from the devils tower deepwater facility are recognized as volumes are delivered over the life of the reserves  cash payments from our customer are based on a contractual fixed fee received over a defined term 
as a result  million of cash received  which is included in cash flow from operations  was deferred at december  and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
venezuela the million increase in segment profit for our venezuelan assets is primarily due to the absence of a fire at the el furrial facility that reduced revenues by million in the first quarter of other the million increase in segment profit in our other businesses includes the million gulf liquids insurance arbitration award and the absence of million in gulf liquids impairment charges in the remaining increase is comprised of the following 
combined margins from our olefins businesses improved million reflecting the overall improvement in olefins pricing and higher production volumes 
market prices for ethylene and propylene products increased due to higher demand and lower inventories 
production volumes increased as a result of increased spot sales and the new higher fixed margin contract at our giesmar facility while our canadian and gulf liquids volumes benefited from improved plant operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined million largely due to asset sales and lower legal expenses 
the favorable variances above are partially offset by a million impairment charge related to our equity investment in the discovery partnership  reflecting management s assessment that there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment 
vs 
revenues increased billion primarily as a result of adopting eitf  which changed how we report natural gas liquids trading activities 
the costs of such activities are no longer reported as reductions in revenues 
eitf does not require restatement of prior year amounts 
in addition to this effect  our 
table of contents revenues increased million primarily due to higher ngl revenues at our gas processing plants as a result of moderate market price increases  partially offset by lower ngl production volumes 
additional fee revenues associated with newly constructed deepwater assets and higher olefins sales also contributed to the revenue increase 
costs and operating expenses also increased billion primarily due to the adoption of eitf as discussed in the previous paragraph 
in addition to this effect  costs and expenses increased million  of which million is attributable to rising market prices for natural gas used to replace the heating value of ngls extracted at our gas processing facilities 
feedstock purchases for the olefins facilities increased million due to higher ngl and gas prices as well as higher purchase volumes 
segment profit increased million and includes impairment charges of million in related to the gulf liquids facilities and million in relating to the redwater fort mcmurray olefins assets 
the remaining million increase is largely attributable to higher deepwater and other gulf coast fee revenues partially offset by unfavorable results in our canadian and gulf olefins operations 
segment profit benefited from increased processing margins in both and due to rising ngl prices coupled with depressed natural gas prices in the wyoming area 
in contrast  canadian and gulf olefins production margins suffered as market prices for ethane and propane feedstocks increased more than those for the olefins produced at these facilities  which lowered operating results 
in addition  gains on asset and investment sales  reduced selling  general and administrative expenses  and gathering system net gains are offset by lower partnership earnings and higher depreciation expense 
a more detailed analysis of segment profit of our various operations is presented below domestic gathering processing the million increase in domestic gathering and processing segment profit includes a million increase in the gulf coast region  partially offset by a million decline in the west region 
the gulf coast region s million improvement is largely attributable to million of incremental segment profit associated with new infrastructure in the deepwater area of the gulf of mexico 
the canyon station production platform  seahawk gas gathering pipeline  and banjo oil transportation system were placed into service during the latter half of and each contributed to midstream s segment profit 
the remaining gulf coast gathering and processing assets provided approximately million in additional net revenues  primarily from million in higher processing margins and million in higher fee based revenues 
a portion of this increase relates to the temporary processing agreements which allow producers gas to be processed to achieve pipeline quality standards 
the west region s million segment profit decline reflects the absence of million in operating profit associated with the kansas hugoton gathering system sold in august although segment profit is comparable to  the west region s segment results were impacted by several offsetting factors discussed below 
gas processing margins declined million compared to margins experienced in throughout and the first quarter of  rising ngl prices and depressed wyoming natural gas prices yielded very favorable processing margins 
wyoming natural gas prices rebounded at the end of the first quarter as the completion of the kern river pipeline system added transportation capacity relieving downward price pressure 
margins recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter as wyoming gas prices lagged behind the increases in other energy commodities 
gathering and processing fee revenues declined million primarily due to fewer customers electing the fee based billing option of processing contracts 
non reimbursed fuel expenses declined million  largely attributed to favorable adjustments in the annual fuel reimbursement rates 
we realized million in non recurring net product gains related to our gas gathering system 
these gains represent less than one third of one percent of total gas gathered and are within industry 
table of contents standards 
historically our gathering system realizes net gains and losses  and therefore  we do not consider these gains to be recurring in nature 
depreciation expense was million higher in large part due to additional investments in the west region 
venezuela segment profit for our venezuelan assets remained virtually unchanged 
higher compression rates in and the currency exchange loss resulted in million higher profits at the pigap gas compression facility 
these higher profits were partially offset by an million decrease in the el furrial revenues attributed to plant downtime caused by a fire that occurred in the first quarter of also offsetting the increase in pigap operating profit is a million decline resulting from the termination of the jose terminal operations contract in december our venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently operated for the exclusive benefit of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa  the state owned petroleum corporation of venezuela 
the venezuelan economic and political environment can be volatile  but has not significantly impacted the operations and cash flows of our facilities 
effective february   the venezuelan government revalued the fixed exchange rate for their local currency from  bolivars to the dollar to  bolivars to the dollar 
this effect of this currency devaluation was recorded in the first quarter of and did not have a significant impact on our first quarter segment profit 
other the million decline in segment profit for midstream s other operations includes impairment charges of million in related to the gulf liquids facilities and the absence of million of profit in relating to the redwater fort mcmurray olefins assets 
the remaining decrease is attributed to lower domestic olefins margins and unfavorable partnership earnings  partially offset by the gain on sale of our wholesale propane operations as discussed below 
excluding impairment charges  segment profit for our olefins businesses declined million primarily as a result of reduced olefins margins as the price of ethane  propane  and natural gas feedstocks increased more than the price of olefins products 
higher maintenance expenses also contributed to the decline in segment profit 
olefins production margins continue to be impacted by weak consumer demand for products produced by petrochemical facilities 
segment profit from partially owned domestic assets accounted for using the equity method remained largely unchanged and includes million lower earnings from partially owned investments primarily resulting from million in prior period accounting adjustments recorded on the discovery partnership and the sale of other investments that generated million in higher earnings 
these unfavorable results were partially offset by net gains totaling approximately million from the sale of our interests in the west texas  rio grande  wilprise  and tri states liquids pipeline partnerships 
segment profit for our trading  fractionation  and storage group increased million primarily due to a million gain on the fourth quarter sale of our wholesale propane business consisting of certain supply contracts and seven propane distribution terminals 
our ngl trading operations activities were substantially curtailed in  resulting in million lower selling  general  and administrative costs partially offset by million in lower net trading revenues 
in addition  ngl service fees declined million due to the sale of several ngl terminals in other overview of during february  we were a party to a recapitalization plan completed by longhorn 
as a result of this plan  we sold a portion of our equity investment in longhorn for million  received million in repayment of a portion of our advances to longhorn and converted the remaining advances  including accrued interest  into preferred equity interests in longhorn 
these preferred equity interests are subordinate to the preferred interests held by the new investors 
no gain or loss was recognized on this transaction 

table of contents outlook for in  we expect to see improved results from our investment in longhorn 
the first product shipments on the longhorn pipeline occurred in december and volumes should increase throughout new shippers have been approved and more approvals are currently in process 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we finalized a sales agreement on our longhorn operating agreement 
the sale is expected to close during the first quarter or early in the second quarter of we expect to receive proceeds on the sale over the remaining term of the operating agreement  which expires on june  we do not expect to recognize a gain or loss on the sale 
year over year operating results years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit loss vs 
other segment revenues for includes approximately million of revenues related to certain butane blending assets  which were sold during third quarter other segment loss for includes million of accrued environmental remediation expense associated with the augusta refinery  and a million impairment  million of equity losses  and million of net unreimbursed advisory fees  all related to our investment in longhorn 
the environmental accrual results from new information obtained in the fourth quarter of the impairment charge reflects management s belief that there was an other than temporary decline in the fair value of this investment following a determination that additional funding would be required to commission the pipeline into service 
the project incurred cost overruns in preparation for commissioning  including higher priced line fill costs 
the net unreimbursed advisory fees relate to the recapitalization of longhorn as discussed above 
if the project achieves certain future performance measures  the unreimbursed fees may be recovered 
other segment loss for includes a million impairment related to our investment in equity and debt securities of longhorn 
the impairment resulted from our assessment that there had been an other than temporary decline in the fair value of this investment 
vs 
other segment loss for includes the million impairment of longhorn noted above 
longhorn equity earnings increased million during from a loss of million in the segment profit includes a million gain on the sale of our percent ownership interest in the lithuanian operations partially offset by a million equity loss for those operations 

table of contents energy trading activities as of december   we held all of these energy and energy related contracts for trading purposes and carried them on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
with the adoption of eitf on january   we reversed approximately billion of non derivative fair value through a cumulative adjustment from a change in accounting principle 
these contracts are now accounted for under the accrual method 
effective january   only energy contracts meeting the definition of a derivative are reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
fair value of trading and non trading derivatives the chart below reflects the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes as of december  we have presented the fair value of assets and liabilities by the period in which we expect them to be realized 
net assets liabilities millions to be to be to be to be realized in realized in realized in realized in months months months months net fair year years years years value as the table above illustrates  we are not materially engaged in trading activities 
however  we hold a substantial portfolio of non trading derivative contracts 
non trading derivative contracts are those that hedge or could possibly hedge on an economic basis forecasted transactions associated with power s long term structured contract position and owned generation  exploration production s forecasted sales of natural gas production  as well as the activities of our other segments 
as a result of our decision to retain the power business  in the fourth quarter of we designated a portion of the existing derivatives as sfas cash flow hedges 
many of these non trading derivatives had an existing fair value prior to their designation as cash flow hedges 
certain other of power s derivatives have not been designated as or do not qualify as sfas hedges 
we also hold certain derivative contracts  which also qualify as sfas cash flow hedges  that primarily hedge exploration production s forecasted natural gas sales 
the chart below reflects the fair value of derivatives held for non trading purposes as of december  of the total fair value of non trading derivatives  sfas cash flow hedges had a net liability value of million as of december   which includes the fair value of the derivatives upon their designation as sfas cash flow hedges 
net assets liabilities millions to be to be to be to be to be realized in realized in realized in realized in realized in months months months months months net fair year years years years years value methods of estimating fair value most of the derivatives we hold settle in active periods and markets in which quoted market prices are available 
quoted market prices in active markets are readily available for valuing  future contracts  swap agreements and physical commodity purchases and sales in the commodity markets in which we transact 
while an active market may not exist for the entire period  quoted prices can generally be obtained for natural gas through and power through these prices reflect the economic and regulatory conditions that currently exist in the marketplace and are subject to change in the near term due to changes in market conditions 
the availability of quoted market prices in active markets varies between periods and commodities based upon changes in market conditions 

table of contents the ability to obtain quoted market prices also varies greatly from region to region 
the time periods noted above are an estimation of aggregate liquidity 
an immaterial portion of our total net derivative value of million relates to periods in which active quotes cannot be obtained 
we use prices of current transactions to further validate price estimates 
however  the decline in overall market liquidity since has limited our ability to validate prices 
we estimate energy commodity prices in illiquid periods by incorporating information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets  quoted prices in less active markets  and other market fundamental analysis 
due to the adoption of eitf  modeling and other valuation techniques are not used significantly in determining the fair value of our derivatives 
such techniques were primarily used in previous years for valuing non derivative contracts such as transportation  storage  full requirements  load serving  transmission and power tolling contracts  which are no longer reported at fair value see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
counterparty credit considerations we include an assessment of the risk of counterparty non performance in our estimate of fair value for all contracts 
such assessment considers the credit rating of each counterparty as represented by public rating agencies such as standard poor s and moody s investors service  the inherent default probabilities within these ratings  the regulatory environment that the contract is subject to and the terms of each individual contract 
risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows 
we continually assess this risk 
we have credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if necessary 
at december   we held collateral support of million 
we also enter into netting agreements to mitigate counterparty performance and credit risk 
during  we did not incur any significant losses due to recent counterparty bankruptcy filings

the net credit exposure from our derivatives as of december  is summarized below 
investment counterparty type grade a total millions gas and electric utilities energy marketers and traders financial institutions other credit reserves net credit exposure from derivatives b a we determine investment grade primarily using publicly available credit ratings 
we included counterparties with a minimum standard poor s rating of bbb or moody s investors service rating of baa in investment grade 
we also classify counterparties that have provided sufficient collateral  such as cash  standby letters of credit  adequate parent company guarantees  and property interests  as investment grade 
b one counterparty within the california power market represents more than ten percent of the derivative assets and is included in investment grade 
standard poor s and moody s investors service do not currently rate this counterparty 
we included this counterparty in the investment grade column based upon contractual credit requirements 
trading policy we have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk management activities and transactions 
these policies cover authority and delegation thereof in addition to control requirements  authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations 
power s value at risk is limited in aggregate and calculated at a percent confidence level 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity liquidity overview of entering  we faced significant liquidity challenges with sizeable maturing debt obligations and limited financial flexibility due in part to covenants arising from short term financing 
in february  we outlined our planned business strategy to address these issues 
during  we made substantial progress in strengthening our finances by generating cash proceeds of approximately billion from asset sales  retiring billion in debt  redeeming million in preferred stock and issuing billion in debt at more favorable market rates 
in  we continued to execute certain components of the plan 
our key results for include the following 
the replacement of our cash collateralized letter of credit and revolver facility with facilities that do not encumber cash 
completion of planned asset sales  which resulted in proceeds of approximately million see further discussion in investing activities 
significant debt reduction of approximately billion in through scheduled maturities and early redemptions  including an exchange offer for our feline pacs units see further discussion in financing activities 
reduction of the risk and liquidity requirements of our power business 
as discussed previously  our board of directors approved the decision to retain power and end our efforts to exit that business 
we have and will continue to manage this business to minimize financial risk  generate cash and manage existing contractual commitments 
during  we reduced risk through the sale  termination or expiration of certain contracts and through entering into new contracts that economically hedge existing positions 
additional net reduction of million in our selling  general and administrative costs and general corporate expenses 
in an effort to further reduce costs in the future  we entered into an agreement with ibm to provide support services for certain areas of our business as discussed previously 
sources of liquidity our liquidity is derived from both internal and external sources 
certain of those sources are available to us at the parent level and others are available to certain of our subsidiaries 
at december   we have the following sources of liquidity from cash and cash equivalents cash equivalent investments at the corporate level of million as compared to billion at december   and cash and cash equivalent investments of various international and domestic entities of million  as compared to million at december  at december   we have capacity of million available under our two unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling million 
in april  we entered into two unsecured bank revolving credit facilities totaling million 
these facilities provide for both borrowings and letters of credit  but are used primarily for issuing letters of credit 
use of these new facilities released approximately million of restricted cash  restricted investments and margin deposits in the second quarter 
in january  these facilities were terminated and replaced with two new facilities that contain similar terms but fewer restrictions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   we also have capacity of million available under our billion secured revolving facility 
on may   we entered into a new three year  billion secured revolving credit facility 
table of contents which is available for borrowings and letters of credit 
in august  we expanded the credit facility by an additional million 
northwest pipeline and transco each have access to million under the facility  which is secured by certain midstream assets and guaranteed by williams gas pipeline company  llc  the parent company of transco and northwest pipeline wgp see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had capacity of million available under the million revolving and letter of credit facility which was terminated on may  we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that authorizes us to issue an additional billion of a variety of debt and equity securities 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiaries  northwest pipeline and transco  also have outstanding registration statements filed with approximately million of shelf availability remaining under these registration statements at december  our ability to utilize these registration statements for debt securities was restricted by certain covenants of our debt agreements at december  on january   this restriction was removed from the parent and from transco with the replacement of our two unsecured revolving credit facilities see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates  market conditions  and industry conditions will affect amounts raised  if any  in the capital markets 
during  we satisfied liquidity needs with billion in cash generated from sales of investments  property  and other assets  including the sale of the alaska refinery and related assets and the sale of the canadian straddle plants  approximately billion in cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations  including the release of approximately million of restricted cash and margin deposits previously used to collateralize certain credit facilities  and the release of approximately million of restricted investments previously used to collateralize certain credit facilities 
credit ratings as part of executing the business plan announced in february  we established a goal of returning to investment grade ratios 
our decision to remain in the power business could delay that goal 
our standard and poor s  moody s investors service moody s  and fitch ratings fitch debt ratings at december  are as follows 
current senior unsecured debt ratings northwest williams pipeline transco standard poor s b b b moody s investors service b ba ba fitch ratings bb bb bb on july   standard poor s raised our debt ratings outlook from negative to stable citing our debt reduction efforts 
with respect to standard poor s  a rating of bbb or above indicates an investment grade rating 
a rating below bbb indicates that the security has significant speculative characteristics 
a b rating indicates that standard and poor s believes the issuer has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  but that adverse business  financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment to the obligation 
standard and poor s may modify its ratings with a or a sign to show the obligor s relative standing within a major rating category 
on november   moody s investors service raised our senior implied rating to ba from b and our senior unsecured rating to b from b  with a stable outlook 
with respect to moody s  a rating of baa or above indicates an investment grade rating 
a rating below baa is considered to have speculative 
table of contents elements 
a ba ranking indicates an obligation that is judged to have speculative elements and is subject to substantial credit risk 
a b rating from moody s signifies an obligation that is considered speculative and is subject to high credit risk 
the  and modifiers show the relative standing within a major category 
a indicates that an obligation ranks in the higher end of the broad rating category  indicating a mid range ranking  and ranking at the lower end of the category 
on december   fitch raised our senior unsecured rating to bb from b and revised the ratings outlook to stable from positive 
with respect to fitch  a rating of bbb or above indicates an investment grade rating 
a rating below bbb is considered speculative grade 
a bb rating from fitch indicates that there is a possibility of credit risk developing  particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time  however  business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met 
fitch may add a or a sign to show the obligor s relative standing within a major rating category 
as our financial ratios improve and we continue to reduce debt in line with forecasts  our ratings could improve 
improved ratings could result in lower borrowing costs 
however  if our financial ratios do not meet expected levels  the outlook and the rating could decline 
our historical debt to capitalization ratios and our forecasted amount for are shown below 
expected debt to capitalization debt includes long term debt and long term debt due within one year 
capitalization includes debt as calculated above plus stockholders equity 
off balance sheet financing arrangements and guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties as discussed in sources of liquidity  in april  we entered into two unsecured bank revolving credit facilities totaling million 
we were able to obtain the unsecured credit facilities because the funding bank syndicated its associated credit risk into the institutional investor market 
upon the occurrence of certain credit events  letters of credit outstanding under the agreement become cash collateralized  creating a borrowing under the facilities 
concurrently  the bank can deliver the facilities to the institutional investors  whereby the investors replace the bank as lender under the facilities 
to facilitate the syndication of the facilities  the bank established trusts funded by the institutional investors 
the assets of the trusts serve as collateral to reimburse the bank for our borrowings in the event the facilities are delivered to the investors 
we have no asset securitization or collateral requirements under the new facilities 
during the second quarter  use of these new facilities released approximately million of restricted cash  restricted investments and margin deposits 
in january  these facilities were terminated and replaced with two new facilities that contain similar terms but fewer restrictions see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have various guarantees which are disclosed in notes    and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe these guarantees or the possible fulfillment of them will negatively impact our liquidity 
operating activities the increase in cash flow from operations from to is primarily due to the increase in cash flow from changes in accounts payable of million  the increase in cash flow from changes in derivatives and energy risk management and trading assets and liabilities of million  the reduction of margin deposit requirements of million  and the improvement in income loss from continuing operations of million 

table of contents lower margin deposit funding requirements in  facilitated by letter of credit issues  resulted in higher cash inflow in in addition  positive cash flows resulting from the settlement of derivative contracts contributed to higher cash inflow primarily from power in the increase in cash flows from operations were largely offset by a decrease in cash flow from changes in accounts receivable of million  due primarily to the operation of power s managed assets 
additionally  on november   winterthur remitted approximately million to us in the settlement of certain disputes regarding insurance obligations under construction contracts see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in funds from noncurrent restricted cash of million in is primarily due to the release of cash held as collateral for various surety bonds

we also recorded net gain on disposition of assets of million  million  and million  in   and  respectively see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we recorded an accrual for fixed rate interest included in the secured note payable of williams production rmt company the rmt note on the consolidated statement of cash flows representing the quarterly non cash reclassification of the deferred fixed rate interest from an accrued liability to the rmt note 
the amortization of deferred set up fee and fixed rate interest on the rmt note relates to amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as interest expense  but which were not payable until maturity

in fourth quarter  we received million in cash proceeds from the sale of notes receivable from wiltel to leucadia 
significant items reflected as discontinued operations within investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows include capital expenditures of texas gas  primarily for expansion of its interstate natural gas pipeline system  of million in outlook for and beyond we enter having completed our restructuring plan and are now in a position to shift to growth through disciplined investments in natural gas businesses 
in  we expect to continue to reduce debt  although not at the levels experienced in the last year 
as noted previously  we expect to maintain liquidity from cash and revolving credit facilities of at least billion 
we are maintaining this level as we consider the potential impact of significant changes in commodity prices  contract margin requirements above current levels  unplanned capital spending needs and the need to meet near term scheduled debt payments 

table of contents as of december   our two unsecured revolving credit facilities contained covenants that restricted our ability to issue new debt  with minimal exceptions  until a certain fixed charge coverage ratio was achieved 
in january  these facilities were terminated and replaced with two new facilities from which most of the restrictive covenants  including this fixed charge ratio  were removed 
as a result of our growth  we estimate capital and investment expenditures will increase in the future to approximately billion to billion in of the estimated capital expenditures for  approximately million to million is for maintenance related projects primarily at gas pipeline  including pipeline replacement and clean air act projects 
we expect to fund capital and investment expenditures  debt payments  and working capital requirements through cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from operations  which is currently estimated to be between billion and billion in potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed above include 
lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations 
to mitigate this exposure  exploration production has economically hedged the price of natural gas for approximately mmcfe per day of its expected production of to mmcfe per day 
power estimates that it has economically hedged revenues  of varying degrees of certainty  covering approximately percent of its fixed demand obligations through sensitivity of margin requirements associated with our marginable commodity contracts 
as of december  we estimate our exposure to additional margin requirements over the next days to no more than million 
exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and litigation issues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on our available cash on hand and expected cash flows from operations  we believe we have  or have access to  the financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet future cash requirements and maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of funds 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual obligations by period 
thereafter total millions long term debt  including current portion principal interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations fuel conversion and other service contracts other other long term liabilities  including current portion physical financial derivatives other total excludes sublease income of million consisting of million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
includes a power tolling agreement that is now accounted for as an operating lease as a result of our implementation of eitf issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  eitf 
this agreement was previously included in fuel conversion and other service contracts within purchase obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
power has entered into certain contracts giving us the right to receive fuel conversion services as well as certain other services associated with electric generation facilities that are currently in operation throughout the continental united states 
although the amounts presented represent expected cash outflows  a portion of those obligations have previously been paid in accordance with third party margining agreements 
as of december   we have paid million in margins  adequate assurance  and prepays related to the obligations included in this disclosure 
in addition  the obligations for physical and financial derivatives are based on market information as of december  because market information changes daily and has the potential to be volatile  significant changes to the values in this category may occur 
includes one year of annual payments totaling million for contracts with indefinite termination dates 
expected offsetting cash inflows resulting from product sales or net positive settlements are not reflected in these amounts 
the offsetting expected cash inflows as of december  are billion 
effects of inflation our operations in recent years have benefited from relatively low inflation rates 
approximately percent of our gross property  plant and equipment is at gas pipeline and approximately percent is at other operating units 
gas pipeline is subject to regulation  which limits recovery to historical cost 
while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices  we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace existing assets 
cost based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  may limit our ability to recover such increased costs 
for the other operating units  operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by specific price changes in oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general inflation 
crude  
table of contents refined product  natural gas  natural gas liquids and power prices are particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or the market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future 
environmental we are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies  cleanup operations and or remedial processes at certain sites  some of which we currently do not own see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties  the us environmental protection agency epa  or other governmental authorities 
we are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others 
current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately million  all of which are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet at december  we expect to seek recovery of approximately million of the accrued costs through future natural gas transmission rates 
the remainder of these costs will be funded from operations 
during  we paid approximately million for cleanup and or remediation and monitoring activities 
we expect to pay approximately million in for these activities 
estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies  preliminary results of studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations 
at december   certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield significantly different estimates of most likely costs 
therefore  the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount  type and extent of contamination discovered at these sites  the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities  and other factors 
we are subject to the federal clean air act and to the federal clean air act amendments of which require the epa to issue new regulations 
we are also subject to regulation at the state and local level 
in september  the epa promulgated rules designed to mitigate the migration of ground level ozone in certain states 
in march and june  the epa promulgated additional regulation regarding hazardous air pollutants which may impose additional controls 
capital expenditures necessary to install emission control devices on our transco gas pipeline system to comply with rules were approximately million in and are estimated to be between million and million over the next three years 
this estimate of remaining expenditures is more than percent lower than previous estimates due to expenditures  further analysis of the requirements  and also more clarification and finalization of government regulations 
the actual costs incurred will depend on the final implementation plans developed by each state to comply with these regulations 
we consider these costs on our transco system associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and  therefore  recoverable through its rates 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio  which was significantly reduced in by early retirements and payments 
we reduced our total long term debt  including current portion  from approximately billion at december   to approximately billion at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
the maturity of our long term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected life of our operating assets 
the tables below provide information as of december  and  about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
long term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows  net of discount premium  and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
fair value december  thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt  including current portion fixed rate interest rate variable rate interest rate fair value december  thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt  including current portion fixed rate interest rate variable rate interest rate marketable securities notional amount fixed rate the weighted average interest rate for is libor plus percent 
the weighted average interest rate for was libor plus percent 
the marketable equity securities matured in the consolidated balance sheet classification was determined based on the expected term of the underlying collateral requirement 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  power  crude oil  refined products and natural gas liquids and additionally to other market factors  such as market volatility and commodity price correlations  including correlations between crude oil and gas prices and between natural gas and power prices 
we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy related assets  our long term energy related contracts and our proprietary trading activities 
we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives 
the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy commodity market prices  the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are 
table of contents transacted  and changes in interest rates 
we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value at risk methodology to estimate the potential one day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios 
value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios 
the value at risk model assumes that  as a result of changes in commodity prices  there is a percent probability that the one day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk 
beginning in  the value at risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices 
the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities 
in applying the value at risk methodology  we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues 
in  the value at risk model used historical simulations to estimate hypothetical movements in future market prices  assuming normal market conditions and historical market prices 
in applying both value at risk methodologies  we do not consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one day holding period to execute 
while a one day holding period has historically been the industry standard  a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints 
we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and non trading contracts  as defined in the following paragraphs 
we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories 
derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas and non derivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk 
trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into to provide price risk management services to third party customers 
only contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was million at december  and million at december  during the year ended december   our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of million to a low of million 
non trading our non trading portfolio consists of contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases power natural gas purchases electricity purchases electricity sales the value at risk for contracts held for non trading purposes was million and million at december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of million to a low of million 
certain of the contracts held for non trading purposes were accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas we did not consider the underlying commodity positions to which the cash flow hedges relate in our value at risk model 
therefore  value at risk does not represent economic losses that could occur on a total non trading portfolio that includes the underlying commodity positions 
foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions in foreign countries 

table of contents international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled million and million at december   and  respectively 
these investments are primarily in non publicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value 
we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments 
if a percent change occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the us dollar  the fair value at december   could change by approximately million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments 
the sale of our canadian straddle plants in july decreased our exposure to foreign currency risk 
net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency are located primarily in canada and approximate six percent of our net assets at december   compared to percent of our net assets at december  these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies 
however  these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position  due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency into the us dollar 
as an example  a percent change in the respective functional currencies against the us dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately million at december  we historically have not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies with the exception of a canadian dollar denominated note receivable which was terminated in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  we monitor currency fluctuations and could potentially use derivative financial instruments or employ other investment alternatives if cash flows or investment returns so warrant
