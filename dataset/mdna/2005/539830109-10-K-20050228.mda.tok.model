highlights the financial section of our annual report describes our ongoing operations  including discussions about particular lines of business or programs  our ability to finance our operating activities and trends and uncertainties in our industry and how they might affect our future operations 
we also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments 
we separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of the consolidated company 
we would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them topic location s critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition page post retirement benefit plans page and page environmental matters page  page and page discussion of business segments page and page liquidity and cash flows page and page capital structure and resources page  page and page legal proceedings  commitments and contingencies page and page stock based compensation page  page and page industry considerations defense business considerations the markets for defense and related advanced technology systems for and beyond will continue to be affected by the global war on terrorism  through the continued need for military missions and reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan and the related fiscal consequences of war 
the realities of the war on terrorism have focused greater attention on the security of our homeland and better communication and interplay between law enforcement  civil government agencies  intelligence agencies and our military services 
at the same time  our nation s overall defense posture continues to move toward a more capabilities based structure  which creates the ability for a more flexible response with greater force mobility  stronger space capabilities  enhanced missile defense and improved information systems capabilities and security 
we anticipate that the next congressionally mandated quadrennial defense review qdr undertaken by the us department of defense dod will reinforce and advance efforts at the dod to refocus activities toward joint operations  net centric command and control  and integrated capabilities for the armed forces 
to address this customer priority  we formed the integrated systems solutions business segment and established the center for innovation to help us better focus our integrated solutions capabilities across the corporation and enhance our ability to serve as a lead partner with the dod 
the president s budget for fiscal year and beyond represents an agenda for a second term in office  and presents a framework to reduce the federal budget deficit while aggressively prosecuting the global war on terrorism 
the rate of growth for budget increases at the dod is reduced  while spending across non defense federal agencies is projected to decline through these changes in the white house budget plan reflect a commitment to cut the federal budget deficit in half by  and sentiment expressed by the federal reserve that sustained federal deficits could hamper economic growth 
the future years defense plan fydp submitted with the president s budget request for fiscal year projects a strong commitment to research and development of transformational capabilities across the military services  while reducing quantities of near term systems compared to previous projections 
as has been widely reported  the president s budget request for fiscal year includes billion for overall defense spending and proposes reductions in funding for a number of existing defense programs  including out year reductions to the f a and c j programs and termination in of the joint common missile and other programs in which lockheed martin participates 
we are actively participating in and monitoring discussions regarding these proposals  but are unable to predict the extent to which these proposals ultimately will be approved as part of the or subsequent budgets approved by congress or what the ultimate impact on lockheed martin would be 
many key decisions on future program quantities and force structure will be reached through the qdr and the base realignment and closure brac actions to be undertaken in budget pressures within dod also may create additional opportunities for business process management and outsourcing of service functions by the military services  expanding the scope of private sector contracting opportunities at the dod 
in september  congress passed an initial billion supplemental appropriation to defray costs for operation enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom during the first quarter of fiscal year the administration has requested an additional billion to meet these costs through the remainder of these supplemental appropriations enabled the dod to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs  versus using amounts available for those programs to pay for the iraq and afghanistan missions 
congress will likely act on this further supplemental request by april while there is no assurance that additional supplemental appropriations will be approved by congress  we do not anticipate that sustained operations in iraq and afghanistan will materially impact the procurement and research and development budget levels projected in the near term 
our broad mix of programs and capabilities gives us the ability to support the needs of the various agencies of the us government that require our solutions 
our major programs and capabilities include missile defense  space intelligence  command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr  air mobility aircraft  and air power projection precision strike capability 
in terms of size and long term potential impact  two of our more significant programs are the f a raptor and the f joint strike fighter 
the air force recently completed the initial operational test and evaluation iot e for the f a air dominance  attack and multi mission combat aircraft 
the determination that the raptor is operationally suitable will permit the dod to complete the upcoming defense acquisition board review which  if successful  will authorize additional production of the f a we are also represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air and space based missile defense  including the aegis weapon system program  medium extended air defense system meads  the patriot advanced capability pac missile program  the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system  and the multiple kill vehicle program 
in the areas of space intelligence and information superiority  we have leadership positions on programs such as the mobile user objective system muos  the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  and the space based infrared system high sbirs h  and in classified programs and battle management command and control capabilities 
in airlift  we have the c j program and are under contract to upgrade the c strategic airlift aircraft 
many of these programs are large and require funding over several budget cycles 
as discussed earlier  there are risks associated with these and other large  highly visible programs subject to appropriation by congress that  because of their size  could be expected to become potential targets for reduction or extension of funding to pay for other programs 
the qdr will assess current and future capabilities required by the dod  and may result in program and force structure changes to be reflected in future defense budget requests 
we continue to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management and e government solutions for our customers  including the us social security administration  the environmental protection agency  and the dod 
we provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle software support  information assurance and enterprise solutions 
consistent with the president s agenda  the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public private competitions  such as the recent selection of lockheed martin to operate the federal aviation administration s automated flight services station network 
in addition  recent trends have indicated an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions 
as a result  we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies 
in addition  the increase in emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  ports and waterways security  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  information systems security and other technical systems solutions 
during the s  companies in our industry reacted to shrinking defense budgets for procurement and research and development by combining to maintain critical mass 
more recently  we have sought to expand into adjacent product lines such as with the littoral combat ship program and the recently awarded marine one us presidential helicopter contract 
in addition  we have focused our efforts on select core acquisitions  cost savings and improving efficiency  as well as generating cash to repay debt incurred during the period of consolidation 
through these activities  we have been able to pass along savings to our customers  mainly the dod 
non us defense budgets have generally been flat or declining over the past decade 
as a result  consolidation has also been occurring in the european aerospace industry  resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors 
space business the commercial launch vehicle marketplace remains very competitive due mainly to lower than expected demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry 
the reduction in demand has resulted in pricing pressures in both the launch vehicle and satellite markets 
we received new orders for both commercial satellites and launch vehicles in both and the above factors have impacted orders for our commercial launch vehicles  including the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv or atlas v  our next generation launch vehicle program in which we have made significant investments over the past few years 
the atlas v is available for both commercial and us government use 
this program has required investment of funds for research and development  start up and other nonrecurring costs  and launch facilities 
some of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the us government 
commercial orders to date for the atlas v launch vehicle have been lower than originally expected and at lower prices 
however  we have received a total of launch assignments from the us government including those described in the following paragraph  six of which are under contract and in backlog 
the us government has been awarding missions incrementally as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy for future national missions 
we had six atlas launches in  including our fourth atlas v commercial launch 
as of year end  the atlas family of launch vehicles had a record of consecutive successful launches 
in july  the us air force announced that our competitor in the eelv competition had violated the procurement integrity act 
as a result of that determination  the air force reassigned seven launch vehicles from the initial competition referred to as buy i to us and removed our exclusion from west coast launches 
at the same time  the air force assigned us three new west coast launches 
to prepare for these  we are upgrading west coast launch facilities  which requires further investment in the eelv program see note to the financial statements 
the investment will be recovered through pricing of the west coast launches 
the seven reassigned launches are expected to occur over the through time period 
it is currently anticipated that the west coast launch facilities will be operational during the us government wants to maintain assured access to space to the maximum extent possible and has recognized the need to fund additional eelv infrastructure costs created by the weaker than originally anticipated commercial market for launch services 
the assured access monies approved in the defense budget will cover a portion of these costs 
there is no assurance that the assured access funding provided for in the president s fiscal year budget request will be approved by congress 
lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei  a joint venture we have with two russian government owned space firms  has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial  non russian origin space payloads on the proton family of rockets from a launch site in kazakhstan 
commercial atlas and proton launch services are marketed around the world through international launch services ils  a joint venture between lockheed martin and lkei 
we consolidate the results of operations of lkei and ils into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest 
we received six new awards for launches on proton vehicles in contracts for launch services usually require substantial advances from the customer prior to launch 
at the end of  million of advances received from customers for proton launch services not yet provided was included as a liability in our balance sheet in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred 
a sizeable percentage of the advances we receive from customers for proton launch services are sent to khrunichev state research and production space center khrunichev  the manufacturer of the launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services in russia 
if a contracted launch service is not provided  a sizeable percentage of the related advance would have to be refunded to our customer 
in addition  we have sent advances to khrunichev for launches we purchased which have not yet been assigned to our customers 
the advances sent to khrunichev are included on our balance sheet in inventories 
advances for launches not under contract are subject to an agreement entered into in which provides for reduced future launch payments from us to khrunichev  contingent on the receipt of new orders as well as a minimum number of actual launches each year 
at year end  payments to khrunichev included in inventories totaled million 
our ability to realize the remaining amounts may be affected by khrunichev s ability to provide the launch services and the political environment in russia 
through the end of  launch services through lkei and ils have been provided according to contract terms 
the corporation has entered into an agreement with rd amross  a joint venture of the pratt whitney division of united technologies corporation and the russian firm npo energomash  for the purchase  subject to certain conditions  of rd booster engines for use in the corporation s atlas launch vehicles 
terms of the agreement call for payments to be made to rd amross upon the achievement of certain milestones in the manufacturing process 
payments of million made under this agreement for engines not yet delivered were included in the corporation s inventories at december  in prior years  the us department of state has authorized one year international traffic in arms regulations itar license extensions authorizing lockheed martin to have discussions with npo energomash on the rd engine and its use on the atlas v launch vehicle 
in  the us department of state issued a three year license extension  therefore mitigating the need for the annual license renewal process  and providing for longer term stability for atlas v sales 
in addition  the proton launch services license also was extended for three years 
as discussed above  the commercial satellite market has continued to experience pricing pressures due to excess capacity 
however  in the past two years  we have received seven commercial satellite orders and are in active discussions for additional satellite orders 
we expect to continue to control costs in our commercial satellite manufacturing business while keeping our focus on providing a reliable product 
in addition to commercial activity  we also have received new orders for government satellites in including the muos program and certain classified activities 
a significant portion of the work on the muos program will be performed in our commercial satellite manufacturing facility 
other business considerations as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
a conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time 
similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty  based on current facts  we do not believe that any of the claims  audits or investigations pending against us are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
changes in government procurement policies and practices over the past several years  such as increases in the progress payment rate and the use of performance based payments  have had a positive effect on our financial position and cash flows 
but we are still exposed to risks associated with us government contracting  including technological uncertainties  dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers and obsolescence  as well as congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year 
many of our programs involve the development and application of state of the art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals 
as a result  setbacks  delays  cost growth and product failures can occur 
we provide products and services to government agencies such as the departments of energy  homeland security  justice  and health and human services  the us postal service  the social security administration  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  the us coast guard and the transportation security administration 
although our lines of business addressing civil government needs are not dependent on defense budgets  they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses  as well as other risks unique to the particular programs 
although indemnification by the us government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses  us government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes 
while we maintain insurance for some business risks  it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities 
we do plan to seek  and in certain cases have obtained  limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of during  we received safety act approvals for two such activities 
in the event we were to provide homeland security related products and services to a customer without such qualification  we would not be afforded the benefit of the safety act s cap on tort liability or us government indemnification 
other risks unique to the civil government markets may include development of competing products  technological feasibility and product obsolescence 
we provide products and services to nasa  including the space shuttle program  mainly through our space systems and information technology services business segments 
we also have a equity interest in united space alliance  llc which provides ground processing and other operational services to the space shuttle program 
we are committed to securing return to flight of the space shuttle in we expect to compete for nasa programs related to the new space exploration vision announced by the president and funded by congress for fiscal year we have entered into various joint venture  teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business  including commercial space 
some of these business arrangements include foreign partners 
the conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations 
the nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the us department of state and the department of commerce 
if these regulations are violated  it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
we are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition a large part of our business is derived from long term contracts for development  production and service activities which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record long term  fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our c j tactical transport aircraft program  atlas and proton launch vehicle programs  and multiple launch rocket system program 
for certain other long term  fixed price contracts that  along with other factors  require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract  sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
as examples  we use this methodology for our f a raptor program and the aegis weapon system program 
in some instances  long term production programs may require a significant level of development and or a low level of initial production units in their early phases  but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later  full rate production stages 
in those cases  the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost to cost method to the units of delivery method after considering  among other factors  program and production stability 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record sales 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
examples of this type of revenue recognition include the f joint strike fighter system development and demonstration sdd program and the thaad missile defense program 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the us government ie  foreign military sales 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term government contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements in accounting for long term contracts 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under sales and earnings in note to the financial statements 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives and award fees related to performance on contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
award fees are recorded based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government  and therefore not necessarily on market based factors 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulations far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  interest expense  and public relations are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters 
for example  some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under agreements reached with the us government 
products and services provided under long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business 
therefore  the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel separately from the business segment performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
post retirement benefit plans most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans  and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees 
our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans 
this is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
we account for our pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards fas  employers accounting for pensions 
those rules require that the amounts we record  including the expense or income for the plans  be computed using actuarial valuations 
these valuations include many assumptions  including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use 
the key year end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following fiscal year are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
we use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and  in the case of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  past investment experience  judgments about future market trends  changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
we also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
an example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in we reassess the discount rate assumption at the end of each year 
based on our review of interest rates at the end of the year  we lowered our discount rate assumption to at year end  compared to used at the end of this change  together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets over the past few years  resulted in our projecting that the amount of pension expense for will increase by approximately to as compared to expense 
the change in the discount rate is the main factor causing this result 
the decrease of basis points in the discount rate increased the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
this annual review of our pension plan assumptions also affects the pension liability recorded in our balance sheet 
at the end of each of the last three years  we recorded a noncash after tax adjustment in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet to reflect a minimum pension liability for most of our pension plans 
these adjustments were calculated on a plan by plan basis  and were determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation abo for each plan to the fair value of that plan s assets 
the amount by which the abo exceeds the fair value of the plan assets  after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan  must be recorded as a minimum pension liability  with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset  if appropriate  and a reduction to stockholders equity 
in  the adjustment we recorded reduced stockholders equity by about million  mainly due to the change in the discount rate at december  this comes after stockholders equity increased by about million from the adjustment made in  mainly due to favorable asset returns for the year 
at the end of  the adjustment reduced stockholders equity by billion 
these minimum pension liability adjustments did not impact earnings 
the amount of the minimum pension liability is computed at each year end and could decrease or increase depending on changes in interest rates and other factors 
us government cost accounting standards cas are a major factor in determining our funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the u 
s government 
funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore are recognized in our net sales 
the total funding requirement for pension plans under cas in was million 
for  we expect our funding requirements under cas to increase 
also in  funding in addition to the amount calculated under cas will likely be required under internal revenue code rules 
any additional amounts computed under those rules are considered to be prepayments under the cas rules  and therefore are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods 
in and  we made discretionary prepayments of million and million  respectively  to the pension trust  which reduced or will reduce our cash funding requirements in the following year 
the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with fas and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
since the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore recognized in a particular segment s net sales  the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules 
accordingly  the fas cas adjustment is an amount included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under gaap 
see the discussion of net unallocated corporate expense income under discussion of business segments 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law in december under the act  medicare will provide a prescription drug benefit beginning in based on current estimates and pending review of the final regulations related to the act  we calculated a reduction in our retiree healthcare benefit obligation of million at december  the impact on net earnings of the reduction in the net periodic post retirement benefits cost for  after application of government contracting regulations  is not expected to be material 
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental clean up issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or by a state agency 
we record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in note to the financial statements 
judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to  along with other factors  difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed  complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies  and agreements between prps to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees which document the extent and timing of our obligation 
we are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental clean up activities usually cover several years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to clean up sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and continually evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions 
in cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise  we project costs over a reasonable time frame not to exceed years 
given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean up and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  however  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 
under agreements reached with the us government  some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation 
at the end of  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was approximately million 
about of the liability relates to sites in redlands  burbank and glendale  california  and in great neck  new york  mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
the remainder of the liability related to other properties including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be estimated 
we have recorded an asset for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for us government businesses 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales 
any recoveries we receive would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future us government sales and cost of sales 
acquisition and divestiture activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
this is accomplished internally  through our independent research and development activities or with acquisitions 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses that complement our current portfolio and allow expansion into adjacent markets or access to new technologies 
we have made a number of such niche acquisitions during the past several years 
in february  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the sytex group  inc tsgi for net consideration of million 
tsgi provides information technology solutions and technical support services to the dod and other federal agencies 
the transaction is subject to government approvals  including a review under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act and satisfaction of other closing conditions 
we expect the transaction will close in early in june  we terminated our september merger agreement  as amended  with the titan corporation  as certain closing conditions were not met on or before june  as required 
we may also explore the sale of non core businesses and surplus real estate 
if we were to decide to sell any such businesses or real estate  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses  if any  would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired 
results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
all per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a per diluted share basis 
net sales in billions logo the following discussion of net sales and operating results will provide an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements set forth in our statement of earnings 
the discussion of business segments which follows  will describe the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated results for  and for  net sales were billion  a increase over sales 
sales for were billion  an increase of compared to sales increased in all segments as compared to the prior year for the third straight year 
the us government is our largest customer  accounting for about of our sales for  compared to in and in for  and the operating loss profit items in the table below  in addition to other items  were included in net unallocated corporate expense income see the related discussion of business segments below

interest expense for was million  million lower than the amount for this was primarily the result of reductions in our debt portfolio and the favorable impact of having issued billion of floating rate convertible notes in august to replace higher cost fixed rate debt 
our effective tax rates were for  for and for a million reduction in our income tax expense primarily resulting from the closure of an internal revenue service irs examination reduced our tax rate 
a million tax benefit related to settlement of a research and development tax credit claim reduced our tax rate for tax benefits related to export sales  tax refund initiatives  and adjustments to true up actual tax return liabilities reduced our tax rate for each of the three years 
recently enacted tax legislation has repealed the extraterritorial income eti exclusion relating to export sales 
over a transition period beginning in  the new tax rules phase out the eti exclusion benefit and provide for a new tax deduction in computing profits from the sale of products manufactured in the united states 
the tax benefit we realize from the new legislation is expected to be substantially equivalent to the benefit we realized under the repealed eti exclusion 
net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the third straight year 
we reported net earnings of billion per share in  compared to net earnings of billion per share in net earnings for were million per share  and reflected losses from discontinued operations of million per share 
discussion of business segments we operate in five business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  space systems  integrated systems solutions is s and information technology services i ts 
net sales have increased in each of our business segments over the last three years 
our demonstrated performance and broad portfolio of capabilities have contributed to this growth 
in the aeronautics business segment  sales growth has been driven by combat aircraft activities  which made up over of this business segment s revenue 
sales on the f joint strike fighter program have increased as we completed the third full year on the sdd contract 
during  we initiated a weight reduction effort focusing on the short take off vertical landing stovl variant of the aircraft 
approximately  pounds were removed from the stovl design and significant weight savings were applied to the other two variants 
the f a program has contributed to our sales growth as we continue to build aircraft under low rate initial production contracts 
in  f a s  our highest annual total to date on the program  were delivered including the final six production lot aircraft and the first nine production lot aircraft 
activities on our f programs increased as we delivered aircraft during as compared to aircraft in activity on the c j program included delivery of aircraft in  which represented the near completion of the initial aircraft program and delivery of the first two aircraft under the multi year award for aircraft that was received in we began to recognize profits on the c j aircraft delivered in the electronics systems business segment has a broad portfolio of products and services 
many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules 
the mix of contract types varies  and we expect this to continue in the short term  it may affect the year to year comparisons of segment margins and the operating results of the lines of businesses within electronic systems 
the space systems business segment is a key supplier of space solutions  primarily to our us government customers 
satellites and strategic defensive missile system activities are expected to experience steady growth 
the commercial satellite and launch vehicle industries continue to be very competitive  with resulting pricing pressures 
the activities in the titan launch vehicle program will continue  though at a lower level than prior years  as we work to complete the remaining two us government missions 
the is s and i ts business segments continue to focus their capabilities in providing information technology services to defense  intelligence and other government customers 
we expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies 
in the following tables of financial data  the total of the operating results of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount 
with respect to the caption operating profit  the reconciling item net unallocated corporate expense includes the fas cas pension adjustment see discussion below  earnings and losses from equity investments  interest income  costs for certain stock based compensation programs  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  and corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments  as well as other miscellaneous corporate activities 
the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense or income calculated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with fas  and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with us government cas  which are reflected in the business segment results 
cas is a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements  and governs the extent of allocability and recoverability of pension costs on government contracts 
the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore recognized in segment net sales 
the results of operations of the segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules 
this table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total 
in millions net sales aeronautics electronic systems space systems integrated systems solutions information technology services total business segments other operating profit aeronautics electronic systems space systems integrated systems solutions information technology services total business segments net unallocated corporate expense segment operating profit in millions logo the following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment 
total negotiated backlog was billion at december  this amount included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq type contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments 
therefore  due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments  the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs 
the following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note to the financial statements 
aeronautics aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for aeronautics increased by in compared to the majority of the increase in sales  billion  was due to higher volume on the f joint strike fighter  f and f a combat aircraft programs 
in  f s were delivered  more than in the remaining increase in sales was mainly due to higher c activities in air mobility 
there were c j deliveries in compared to deliveries in net sales for aeronautics increased by in compared to due to growth in combat aircraft and air mobility 
approximately half the growth in combat aircraft was due to higher volume on the f program with a majority of the remaining growth attributable to f programs as a result of increased deliveries 
in  f s were delivered  more than in increased c j deliveries contributed million to the year over year growth in sales 
there were c j deliveries in compared to eight deliveries in operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to combat aircraft operating profit increased million primarily as a result of higher sales volume on the programs discussed above and improved performance on the f a program 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to million in operating profit recognized on the c js delivered in the corporation began recognizing profits on c j deliveries in upon resolution of certain technical aircraft performance risks  manufacturing performance improvements and the achievement of stable production as a result of securing a multi year contract in operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to the periods 
this increase was primarily due to the impact of the volume increases in combat aircraft and performance on other programs 
in and  the c j deliveries did not impact operating profit due to the previously disclosed suspension of earnings recognition on the program 
backlog decreased in as compared to primarily as a result of sales volume on the f and f programs as well as deliveries of c j aircraft 
electronic systems electronic systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for electronic systems increased in as compared to the increase in sales was due to higher volume in maritime systems sensors ms and missiles fire control m fc 
higher volume on surface systems programs accounted for most of ms s sales growth of million 
m fc s sales increased million  primarily due to higher volume on fire control and tactical missile programs 
net sales for electronic systems increased in as compared to sales increases in m fc and ms more than offset a decline at platform  training transportation systems pt ts 
increased volume in air defense and tactical missile programs accounted for the majority of m fc s million sales growth over in ms  the million increase in sales was primarily due to higher volume on radar and surface systems programs 
the pt ts decline of million was the result of lower volume on transportation and security system activities 
the majority of this decline is attributable to the rapid deployment of transportation security administration tsa programs 
operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to operating profit increased million due to improved performance on tactical missile and fire control programs at m fc and on radar programs at ms the decrease in operating profit at pt ts was due to a million loss provision recorded in the third quarter of on certain international simulation and training contracts 
operating profit for the segment decreased by in compared to pt ts operating profit declined by million due to a changing mix of program maturity and initial development activities on platform integration programs  as well as the impact of the decline in volume in transportation and security system activities 
these decreases more than offset a million increase in operating profit primarily attributable to higher volume on air defense programs at m fc 
the increase in backlog during over resulted from increased orders on development programs 
space systems space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for space systems increased by in compared to  as increases in satellites of million and strategic defensive missile systems s dms of million more than offset a decrease in launch services 
the increase in satellites was due to increased volume on government satellite programs and one additional commercial satellite delivery in in s dms  the increase was primarily attributable to fleet ballistic missile programs 
the lower volume in launch services was mainly due to a decline in the titan launch vehicle program  which more than offset increases in both atlas launches six in compared to five in and proton launches four in compared to two in 
net sales for space systems increased by in compared to sales increased by million in satellites and million in s dms compared to the growth in satellites was due to higher volume on government satellite programs 
the growth in s dms was attributable to increases in both fleet ballistic missile and missile defense activities 
in launch services  increased titan activities offset lower sales resulting from a decline in proton deliveries two in and four in 
there were five atlas launches in both and operating profit for the segment increased in as compared to launch services operating profit increased million 
this increase was primarily due to us government support of the atlas program and the benefit resulting from the first quarter termination of a launch vehicle contract by a commercial customer  offset by a decline in activities on the titan launch vehicle program 
satellites operating profit increased million due to commercial satellite deliveries  partially offset by lower profitability on a government satellite program 
in  government satellites operating profit reflected a million charge related to a nasa satellite program 
operating profit for the segment increased in as compared to satellites operating profit increased by million over the period mainly due to improved performance on commercial satellite activities and volume increases on government satellite programs  including the impact of a million charge recorded in related to a nasa satellite program 
in launch services  operating profit increased by million 
the increase was primarily due to improved performance and risk retirement activities on the maturing titan program  which were partially offset by the impact of a decline in proton launches in s dms operating profit increased by million due to the impact of the volume increases discussed above 
the increase in backlog during as compared to was mainly due to an increase in orders for government satellites  launch services and missile defense activities 
integrated systems solutions integrated systems solutions operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for is s increased by in as compared to and by for over for both comparative periods  the sales increases were primarily attributable to a higher volume of intelligence  defense and information assurance activities 
operating profit for the segment increased in as compared to and by for over the increases in operating profit for both comparative periods were primarily attributable to higher volume and performance improvements on the activities described above 
information technology services information technology services operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for i ts increased by in as compared to the increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher volume of million in information technology 
information technology s sales improved due to organic growth  as well as the net impact of our purchase of affiliated computer services federal government it business and the concurrent sale of our commercial it business in november the remaining increase in sales of million was primarily attributable to higher volume in defense services  which offset a decline in nasa sales 
net sales for i ts increased by in as compared to the sales increase for the year was mainly the result of volume increases of million in information technology  which more than offset lower sales volume totaling million on defense services and nasa programs 
information technology s results included the net impact of the previously mentioned transactions with affiliated computer services in operating profit for the segment increased by in as compared to the operating profit increase was mainly due to information technology volume and program performance 
operating profit for the segment increased by in as compared to the operating profit increase was mainly due to the higher volume in information technology and improved performance across all lines of business 
the i ts segment includes a business unit that provides services to the government of argentina 
at december   we had net investments in and advances to this unit totaling about million 
while we expect that these amounts will be recovered  there is always the potential that further devaluation of the argentine peso  deterioration in the argentine economy or other factors could adversely affect our ability to recover those amounts 
net unallocated corporate expense income the following table shows the components of net unallocated corporate expense income 
for a discussion of the fas cas pension adjustment and other types of items included in net unallocated corporate expense income  see note to the financial statements 
for information about items not considered in segment operating performance  see the table under the previous discussion of results of operations 
the decrease in other  net was primarily due to lower earnings on our equity investments in in millions fas cas pension adjustment items not considered in segment operating performance other  net the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas and pension expense determined in accordance with fas is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit fas cas pension adjustment 
the cas funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments cost of goods sold 
a majority of the cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing  and is consequently included in the segments sales 
the following table shows the cas funding that is included as expense in the segments operating results  the related fas expense income  and the resulting fas cas pension adjustment in millions fas expense income less cas expense and funding fas cas pension adjustment expense income as disclosed in note to the financial statements  fas expense increased primarily due to higher recognized net actuarial losses and higher service cost in  and due to a lower expected return on plan assets in addition to these other two factors in liquidity and cash flows our management has set forth strategic cash deployment objectives to help ensure that we keep a focus toward growing our core business and increasing shareholder value  and that we are in a position to take advantage of opportunities to do so when they arise 
those objectives include internal investment in our business eg  capital expenditures  independent research and development  share repurchases  increases in dividends  debt reductions  and selected acquisitions of businesses consistent with our strategy 
the following discussion highlights our cash activities over the past three years as well as our future plans 
net cash provided by operating activities in millions logo operating activities cash from operations continues to be the primary source of funds for financing our activities 
cash from operations amounted to billion in  billion in and billion in our earnings  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges  were the driving force behind these cash flows 
our working capital has continued to be a focus of our cash management processes  particularly with our sales having increased by billion over the last three years 
we attribute this performance to our continued discipline in managing our cash conversion cycle  including the negotiation of performance based progress payment or advance payment terms in our contracts  inventory management  and billing and collection activities 
we continue to leverage the billing and collection processes of our shared services centers  including the emphasis on electronic interfaces with our u 
s 
government customers 
cash from operations is net of internal investments we have made in our business relative to independent research and development and bid and proposal activities aggregating million in  million in and million in during and  we made discretionary prepayments of million and million  respectively  to pre fund our pension plan trusts that reduced cash from operations 
such payments were made to reduce our cash funding requirements in the subsequent year 
our cash from operations included million from the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim 
we expect our cash from operations to continue to be strong over the next two years 
investing activities capital expenditures capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in  million in and million in we expect our capital expenditures to increase over the next two years consistent with the expected growth in our business 
acquisitions  divestitures and other activities in addition to our internal investment in capital expenditures and independent research and development activities  we also selectively identify businesses for potential acquisition 
during  we paid million for businesses to strengthen our capabilities in providing services to defense and other government customers 
during  we paid approximately million for two businesses to strengthen our capabilities in providing it services to defense  intelligence and other government customers 
we also paid million in related to our guarantee of space imaging  llc s borrowings under its credit facility 
during the past three years  we have divested non core businesses  primarily those serving commercial markets 
we received cash of approximately million in from the sale of our comsat general business  million in from the sale of our commercial it business and million in from the sale of certain discontinued telecommunication businesses 
during  new skies satellites  nv was sold to a private equity firm 
our portion of the proceeds was million  million of which was received in in december  inmarsat ventures  ltd  a venture in which we held a interest  was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout transaction 
in exchange for our interest  we received cash of million and a ownership interest in the new inmarsat holding company  inmarsat group holdings  ltd  valued at million 
during  inmarsat group holdings refinanced its debt  and we received cash of million  reducing our investment to million while retaining our ownership interest 
in january  the sale of intelsat  ltd 
to a private equity firm was completed for per share 
we received proceeds of about million for our ownership of intelsat 
financing activities issuance and repayment of long term debt cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long term debt 
in  we used billion of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long term debt 
we used million of cash for costs associated with the early retirement of million of debt through our tender offers 
in  we issued billion of floating rate convertible senior debentures that bear interest at three month libor less basis points  reset quarterly 
we used the proceeds of that issuance  along with cash from operations  to repay billion of debt in advance of its maturity and retire other high cost debt 
we used million of cash for debt issuance and repayment costs to complete those transactions 
share repurchases and dividends we also used cash in each of the last three years for the repurchase of shares of our common stock million for million common shares in  of which million for million common shares was settled during the year  million in for million common shares and million in for million common shares 
these transactions were pursuant to our share repurchase program initiated in a total of million common shares may be repurchased in the future under the program 
the payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy 
shareholders were paid cash dividends of million in  million in and million in we have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last two years 
we paid a quarterly dividend of per share during each of the first three quarters of and per share for the last quarter of in  we paid quarterly dividends of per share during each of the first three quarters of the year and for the last quarter of we plan to continue to deploy a majority of the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditures to repurchase shares and pay dividends 
capital structure and resources at december   our total long term debt amounted to billion 
our long term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures 
our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates  except for billion of convertible debentures issued in with a floating interest rate based on libor discussed in more detail below 
through our repayment activities  our long term debt has declined from a balance of billion at december  we improved our debt to total capital ratio from at december  to at december  debt to total capital ratio in percent logo our stockholders equity amounted to billion at december   an increase of million from december  the increase resulted from net earnings and stock plan activities partially offset by our payment of dividends  an increase in our minimum pension liability and share repurchase activity 
return on invested capital roic improved by basis points during to 
we define roic as net income plus after tax interest expense divided by average invested capital stockholders equity plus debt 
we believe that reporting roic provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively lockheed martin uses the capital invested in its operations 
we use roic to evaluate multi year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure 
we also plan to use roic as a factor in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes in roic is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the us  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
roic should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance 
see consolidated financial data five year summary on page for additional information concerning how we calculate roic 
in  we repaid a total of billion of long term debt  including scheduled and early debt repayments 
through the completion of tender offers  we repaid debt totaling million million of our outstanding notes due june  and million of our outstanding notes due december  in connection with these early repayments  we recorded charges in  net of state income tax benefits  totaling million 
the charges reduced net earnings by million per share 
at december   we had in place a billion revolving credit facility  which expires in july  and a million revolving credit facility  which expires in july there were no borrowings outstanding under either facility at december  borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on the eurodollar rate or a defined bank base rate 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets  and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the billion credit facility 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of up to billion in debt securities 
if we were to issue debt under this shelf registration  we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
these purposes may include repayment of debt  working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
our management continually reviews changes in financial  market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and other available financing resources  are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs  projected over the next three years 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle other long term liabilities 
capital lease obligations were negligible 
payments due under these long term obligations and commitments are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt a operating lease commitments purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations a long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only 
generally  our long term debt obligations are subject to  along with other things  compliance with certain covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets 
purchase obligations include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to sub contractors  outsourcing arrangements  and non cancelable commitments for property  plant and equipment 
generally  amounts for purchase obligations in the preceding table exclude contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
these commitments are excluded because the us government would be required to pay us for any costs we incur if they terminate our contracts with them for convenience pursuant to far 
for example  if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our us government customer and the customer terminated the contract for convenience  any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments  as well as amounts previously incurred  would generally be reimbursed by the customer 
this would also be true in cases where we perform sub contract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign  state and local governments 
if so  amounts related to purchase obligations entered into in support of those contracts were excluded from the preceding table 
to the extent contracts with customers do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers  related purchase obligation amounts are included in the table 
amounts related to other long term liabilities in the preceding table represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans  non qualified pension plans and environmental liabilities 
obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements  excluding amounts reimbursed by the us government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party under an agreement entered into in we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees  as follows commitment expiration per period in millions total commitment less than year years years after years standby letters of credit a surety bonds a guarantees total commitments a approximately  million and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year and year periods  respectively  and approximately million of surety bonds in the less than year period  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
included in the table above is approximately million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded in the balance sheet  either as reductions of inventories  as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  or as other liabilities 
approximately billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
these letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance  and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms 
similar to the letters of credit for the f contract  other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate and floating rate long term debt 
the estimated fair values of the corporation s long term debt instruments at december   aggregated approximately billion  compared with a carrying amount of approximately billion 
the majority of our long term debt obligations are not callable until maturity 
we sometimes use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates  however  at year end  we had no such agreements in place 
we use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies  or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities 
related gains and losses on these contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in income at the same time as the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the contracts are recognized currently 
at december   the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding  as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended  were not material 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas r  share based payments  that  upon implementation  will impact our net earnings and earnings per share  and change the classification of certain elements of the statement of cash flows 
fas r requires stock options and other share based payments made to employees to be accounted for as compensation expense and recorded at fair value  and to reflect the related tax benefit received upon exercise of the options in the statement of cash flows as a financing activity inflow rather than an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented 
consistent with the provisions of the new standard  we intend to adopt fas r in the third quarter of  and to implement it on a prospective basis 
information about the fair value of stock options under the black scholes model and its pro forma impact on our net earnings and earnings per share for the year ended december  can be found in note to the financial statements  and we expect the impact of implementing the new standard using this model will be a reduction in earnings per share of approximately to on a full year basis 
however  a number of technical implementation issues are yet to be resolved  including the selection and use of an appropriate valuation model  and the ultimate impact of adopting fas r is not yet known 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this fsp provides specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy to eligible sponsors of retiree health care benefits provided under this law 
using this guidance  the corporation calculated a reduction in its accumulated post retirement benefit obligation at december  of million from the effects of the new law and  after application of government contracting regulations  doesn t anticipate a material impact on net earnings from the reduction in net periodic post retirement benefits cost in controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded 
our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures  we recognize that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost to benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 
we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency  while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment 
changes may include such activities as implementing new  more efficient systems  consolidating the activities of two or more business units  and migrating certain processes to our shared services centers 
in addition  when we acquire new businesses  we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities 
we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  as of december  the evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions  and under the supervision of the ceo and cfo 
during  we devoted significant effort to comply with the rules on internal control over financial reporting issued pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act 
this effort expanded upon our long standing practice of acknowledging management s responsibility for the establishment and effective operation of internal control through performing self assessment and monitoring procedures 
based on this work and other evaluation procedures  our management  including the ceo and cfo  concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures  including our internal control over financial reporting  were effective as of december  management s report on financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page in addition  both our assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting were audited by our independent auditors 
their unqualified report appears on page there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting
