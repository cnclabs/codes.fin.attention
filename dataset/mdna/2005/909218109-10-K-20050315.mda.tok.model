item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation financial condition and liquidity summary 
our financial condition and liquidity depends on the cash flow from our three principal business segments and our subsidiaries that carry out those operations and borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
our cash flow is influenced mainly by the prices we receive for our natural gas production and  to a lesser extent  the prices we receive for our oil production  the quantity of natural gas we produce  the demand for and the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs  and the margins we obtain from our natural gas gathering and processing contracts 
at december   we had cash totaling  and we had borrowed million of the million we had elected to have available under our credit agreement 
our three principal business segments are contract drilling carried out by our subsidiaries unit drilling company and service drilling southwest  llc until it was merged into unit drilling company on december   we also operated through our subsidiary sauer drilling company  oil and natural gas exploration  carried out by our subsidiary unit petroleum company and  until it was merged into unit petroleum company in march  petrocorp incorporated  and natural gas purchasing  gathering and processing carried out by our subsidiary superior pipeline company  llc the following is a summary of certain financial information as of december  and for the years ended december  and december  december  december  percent change in thousands except percent amounts working capital long term debt shareholders equity ratio of long term debt to total capitalization income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities

at december   we had a million bank credit agreement consisting of a revolving credit facility maturing on january  borrowings under the credit facility are limited to a commitment amount and we have currently elected to have the full million available as the commitment amount 
we are charged a commitment fee of 
of on the amount available but not borrowed 
we incurred origination  agency and syndication fees of  at the inception of the agreement   of which will be paid annually and the remainder of the fees amortized over the four year life of the loan 
the average interest rate for was 
at december  and march  our borrowings were million and million  respectively 
the borrowing base under our credit facility is subject to re determination on may and november of each year 
the latest re determination supported the full million 
each re determination is based primarily on the sum of a percentage of the discounted future value of our oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by the banks 
in addition  an amount representing a small part of the value of our drilling rig fleet  limited to million  is added to the loan value 
the credit agreement allows for one requested special re determination of the borrowing base by either the banks or us between each scheduled re determination date 
at our election  any portion of the outstanding debt may be fixed at a london interbank offered rate libor for   or day terms 
during any libor rate funding period the outstanding principal balance of the note to which a libor rate option applies may be repaid after providing three days notice to the administrative agent and on the payment of any required indemnification amounts 
interest on the libor rate is computed at the libor base rate applicable for the interest period plus to depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total loan value and is payable at the end of each term or every days whichever is less 
borrowings not under the libor rate bear interest at the jpmorgan chase prime rate payable at the end of each month and the principal borrowed may be paid anytime in part or in whole without premium or penalty 
at december   all of our million debt was subject to the libor rate 
the credit agreement includes prohibitions against the payment of dividends other than stock dividends during any fiscal year in excess of of our consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year  the incurrence of additional debt with certain very limited exceptions and the creation or existence of mortgages or liens  other than those in the ordinary course of business  on any of our property  except in favor of our banks 
the credit agreement also requires that we have at the end of each quarter a consolidated net worth of at least million

in february  we entered into an interest rate swap to help manage our exposure to possible future interest rate increases 
the contract swaps million of variable rate debt to fixed and covers the period from march  through january this period coincides with the remaining length of our current credit facility 
the fixed rate is based on three month libor and is at 
the swap is a cash flow hedge 
contractual commitments 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands bank debt retirement agreement operating leases serdrilco inc earn out agreement total contractual obligations see previous discussion in management discussion and analysis regarding bank debt 
this obligation is presented in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement signed on january  and includes interest calculated at our year end interest rate of 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expenses for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of king kirchner from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense  including accrued interest  will be paid in monthly payments of  starting in july and continuing through june in the first quarter of  we acquired a liability for the present value of a separation agreement between petrocorp incorporated and one of its previous officers 
the liability associated with this last agreement will be paid in quarterly payments of  through december  both liabilities as presented above are undiscounted 
we lease office space in tulsa and woodward  oklahoma and midland and houston  texas under the terms of operating leases expiring through january  additionally  we have several equipment leases and lease space on short term commitments to stack excess rig equipment and production inventory 
on december   the company acquired serdrilco incorporated and its subsidiary  service drilling southwest llc  for million in cash 
the terms of the acquisition include an earn out provision allowing the sellers to obtain one half of the cash flow in excess of million for each of the three years following the acquisition 
for the year ending december   the drilling rigs included in the earn out provision had cash flow of approximately million 
on october   mr 
john nikkel  the company s chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer  announced that he plans to retire as an employee and as the company s chief executive officer effective april  mr 
nikkel intends to continue as a director of the company 
in connection with his retirement  the board of directors and mr 
nikkel reached an agreement which was memorialized on december   providing for the following mr 
nikkel would serve as a consultant to the company  on an annual basis  for  per year and  the parties  by mutual written agreement  may extend the term of this agreement for successive one year periods at any time before the termination of the then existing term of the agreement  and

on february   the compensation committee of the board of directors elected to reward mr 
nikkel for his years of exemplary service to the company by awarding him a cash bonus of  payable in equal monthly installments commencing on the th month following his retirement on april  in the first quarter of we made a commitment to purchase approximately million of drill pipe and drill collars for delivery during also in the first quarter of  our oil and natural gas segment made a commitment to purchase million of tubing and casing for delivery during the first quarter of at december   we also had the following commitments and contingencies that could create  increase or accelerate our liabilities amount of commitment expiration per period other commitments total accrued less than year years years after years in thousands deferred compensation agreement  unknown unknown unknown unknown separation benefit agreement  unknown unknown plugging liability gas balancing liability  unknown unknown unknown unknown repurchase obligations unknown unknown unknown unknown workers compensation liability we provide a salary deferral plan which allows participants to defer the recognition of salary for income tax purposes until actual distribution of benefits  which occurs at either termination of employment  death or certain defined unforeseeable emergency hardships 
we recognize payroll expense and record a liability  included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  at the time of deferral 
effective january   we adopted a separation benefit plan separation plan 
the separation plan allows eligible employees whose employment with us is involuntarily terminated or  in the case of an employee who has completed years of service  voluntarily or involuntarily terminated  to receive benefits equivalent to four weeks salary for every whole year of service completed with unit up to a maximum of weeks 
to receive payments the recipient must waive any claims against us in exchange for receiving the separation benefits 
on october   we adopted a separation benefit plan for senior management senior plan 
the senior plan provides certain officers and key executives of unit with benefits generally equivalent to the separation plan 
the compensation committee of the board of directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the individuals covered in this plan 
on may  we also adopted the special separation benefit plan 
this plan is identical to the separation benefit plan with the exception that the benefits under the plan vest on the earliest of a participant s reaching the age of or serving years with the unit 
as of december   there were no participants in this plan 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets mainly plugging and abandonment costs for our depleted wells in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled or acquired 
we have recorded a liability for certain properties where we believe there are insufficient oil and natural gas reserves available to allow the under produced owners to recover their under production from future production volumes 
we formed the unit oil and gas limited partnership and the energy income limited partnership along with private limited partnerships the partnerships with certain qualified employees  
table of contents 
index to financial statements officers and directors from through  with a subsidiary of ours serving as general partner 
the partnerships were formed for the purpose of conducting oil and natural gas acquisition  drilling and development operations and serving as co general partner with us in any additional limited partnerships formed during that year 
the partnerships participated on a proportionate basis with us in most drilling operations and most producing property acquisitions commenced by us for our own account during the period from the formation of the partnership through december of that year 
these partnership agreements require  on the election of a limited partner  that we repurchase the limited partner s interest at amounts to be determined in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement in the future 
such repurchases in any one year are limited to of the units outstanding 
we made repurchases of   and  in  and  respectively  for such limited partners interests 
we have recorded a liability for future estimated payments related to workers compensation claims made primarily in our contract drilling segment 
hedging 
periodically we hedge the prices we will receive for a portion of our future natural gas and oil production 
we do so in an attempt to reduce the impact and uncertainty that price variations have on our cash flow 
on april   we entered into a natural gas collar contract for  mmbtu s of production per day that covered the period of april  through october  the collar had a floor of and a ceiling of 
during the year of  our natural gas hedging transactions increased natural gas revenues by  we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  these hedges were cash flow hedges and there was no material amount of ineffectiveness 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two natural gas collar contracts 
each collar contract was for  mmbtu s of production per day and covered the periods of april through september one contract had a floor of and a ceiling of and the other contract had a floor of and a ceiling of 
during the first quarter of  we also entered into two oil collar contracts 
each contract was for  barrels of production per month and covered the period of may through december one contract had a floor price of and a ceiling of and the other contract had a floor price of and a ceiling of 
these hedges were cash flow hedges and there was no material amount of ineffectiveness 
during the year of  the collar contracts decreased natural gas revenues by  and oil revenues by  we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  during the first and second quarters of  we entered into two natural gas collar contracts

one contract covered the period of april through october of and had a floor of and a ceiling of 
the other contract covered the period of may through october of and had a floor of and a ceiling of 
we also entered into an oil hedge covering  barrels per day of oil production 
the transaction covered the periods of february through december of and had an average price of 
these hedges were cash flow hedges and there was no material amount of ineffectiveness 
the natural gas collar contracts increased natural gas revenues by  during oil revenues were reduced by million in due to the settlement of the oil hedge

the fixed rate is based on three month libor and is at 
the swap is a cash flow hedge 

table of contents 
index to financial statements self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  property damage and employee medical benefits 
our insurance policies contain deductibles or retentions per occurrence ranging from  for general liability to million for drilling rig physical damage 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  our per occurrence and aggregate exposure to certain claims 
there is no assurance that the insurance coverage we have will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
following the acquisition of serdrilco we have continued to use its erisa governed occupational injury benefit plan to cover its employees in lieu of covering them under an insured texas workers compensation plan 
impact of prices for our oil and natural gas 
after the acquisition of petrocorp incorporated as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  natural gas comprises of our total oil and natural gas reserves 
before the acquisition  natural gas comprised of our oil and natural gas reserves 
any significant change in natural gas prices has a material affect on our revenues  cash flow and the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
generally  prices and demand for domestic natural gas are influenced by weather conditions  supply imbalances and by world wide oil price levels 
domestic oil prices are primarily influenced by world oil market developments 
all of these factors are beyond our control and we can not predict nor measure their future influence on the prices we will receive 
based on our production in  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
our average natural gas price was compared to an average natural gas price of for a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow based on our production in our average oil price was compared with an average oil price of received in because natural gas prices have such a significant affect on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves  declines in these prices can result in a decline in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
price declines can also adversely affect the semi annual determination of the amount available for us to borrow under our bank credit agreement since that determination is based mainly on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
such a reduction could limit our ability to carry out our planned capital projects 
most of our natural gas production is sold to third parties under month to month contracts 
for  purchases by eagle energy partners i  lp accounted for approximately of our oil and natural gas revenues while purchases by cinergy marketing and trading lp accounted for approximately of our oil and natural gas revenues 
on august   we completed the sale of our limited partner interest in eagle energy partners i  lp eagle s purchase of natural gas from us during accounted for of our oil and natural gas revenues during eagle also marketed approximately of the natural gas volumes we sold for ourselves as well as third parties during the same period 
for the period august through december  eagle s purchases from us accounted for of our oil and natural gas revenues and it marketed approximately of the natural gas volumes we sold for ourselves as well as third parties during the same five month period 
oil and natural gas acquisitions and capital expenditures 
on january   we acquired the outstanding common stock of petrocorp incorporated for million in cash 
at the closing of this acquisition  petrocorp had million in working capital 
petrocorp explored and developed oil and natural gas properties primarily in texas and oklahoma 
approximately of the oil and natural gas properties acquired in the acquisition are located in the mid continent and permian basins  while are located in the rocky mountains and are located in the gulf coast basin 
the acquired properties increased our oil and natural gas reserve base by approximately billion equivalent cubic feet of natural gas and provide us with additional locations for future development drilling 
the results of operations for this acquired company are included in the statement of income for the period after january  
table of contents 
index to financial statements most of our capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward future growth 
our decision to increase our oil and natural gas reserves through acquisitions or through drilling depends on the prevailing or expected market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved  all of which provide us with a large degree of flexibility in deciding when to incur such costs 
we drilled wells net wells in compared to wells net wells in our total capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions in totaled million with million relating to the petrocorp acquisition 
included in the petrocorp acquisition was a plugging liability and deferred tax liability of million 
based on current prices  we plan to drill an estimated to wells in and estimate our total capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions to be around million 
in  due to anticipated increases in steel product costs  we increased our inventory of production casing and tubing from million to million in this inventory will be used to meet our continued demand for such items as we complete wells in our development drilling program 
in the first quarter of  we made a commitment to purchase million of tubing and casing for delivery during the first quarter of contract drilling 
our drilling work is subject to many factors that influence the number of drilling rigs we have working as well as the costs and revenues associated with that work 
these factors include the demand for drilling rigs  competition from other drilling contractors  the prevailing prices for natural gas and oil  availability and cost of labor to run our drilling rigs and our ability to supply the equipment needed 
because of the current high demand for drilling rigs we are experiencing some difficulty in hiring and keeping all of the rig crews we need 
in response  at the end of the first and fourth quarters of  we increased wages in some of our drilling areas and implemented longevity pay incentives to help maintain our contract drilling labor base 
to date  these efforts have allowed us to meet our labor requirements 
if current demands for drilling rigs continues  shortages of experienced personnel may limit our ability to operate our drilling rigs at or above the utilization rate we achieved in the fourth quarter of we currently do not have a shortage of drill pipe 
because of increasing steel costs and the potential for future shortages in the availability of new drill pipe  we committed in the first quarter of to purchase approximately  feet of drill pipe for million 
at december  we had accepted delivery of all of the pipe under the commitment 
early in  we committed to the purchase of another million of drill pipe and collars during most of our contract drilling fleet is targeted to the drilling of natural gas wells so changes in natural gas prices have a disproportionate influence on the demand for our drilling rigs and the prices we can charge for our contract drilling services 
the average rates we received for our drilling rigs during and reached a low of  per day in february of however  as natural gas and oil prices began to rise during the second quarter of and have continued to remain strong through  both demand for our drilling rigs and dayrates have improved 
in  the average dayrate we received was  per day compared to  per day in the average use of our drilling rigs in was drilling rigs compared with rigs for based on the average utilization of our drilling rigs during  a per day change in dayrates has an  per day  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
we expect that utilization and dayrates for our drilling rigs will continue to depend mainly on the price of natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs to meet the demands of the industry 
our contract drilling subsidiary provides drilling services for our exploration and production subsidiary 
the contracts for these services are issued under the same conditions and rates as the contracts we have entered into with unrelated third parties for comparable type projects 
during and  we drilled and wells  respectively  for our exploration and production subsidiary 
the profit received by our contract drilling segment of million and million during and  respectively  was used to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties rather than being included in our operating profit 

table of contents 
index to financial statements drilling acquisitions and capital expenditures 
on july   we completed our acquisition of sauer drilling company  a casper  wyoming based drilling company 
we paid million in this acquisition which included million for working capital 
this acquisition included nine drilling rigs  a fleet of trucks  and an equipment and repair yard containing associated inventory located in casper  wyoming 
the drilling rigs range from horsepower to  horsepower with depth capacities rated from  feet to  feet 
the fleet of trucks consists of four vacuum trucks  and rig up trucks which are used to move the drilling rigs to new drilling locations 
the trucks are also used to move other company s drilling rigs 
this acquisition increased our market share in the rocky mountains in the medium to smaller drilling rig depth ranges 
the casper  wyoming equipment yard will continue to provide service space for the nine newly acquired drilling rigs and trucks as well as our other existing rocky mountain drilling rig fleet 
the results of operations for this acquired company are included in the statement of income for the period after july on may   we acquired two drilling rigs and related equipment for million 
the drilling rigs are rated at and  horsepower  respectively  with depth capacities from  to  feet 
we refurbished these drilling rigs for approximately million 
one drilling rig was placed into service at the beginning of august and the other drilling rig was placed into service in the middle of september both drilling rigs are working in our rocky mountain division 
with these two acquisitions and the completion of construction of another  horsepower diesel electric drilling rig in june  our total drilling rig fleet at december  was drilling rigs 
on january  we acquired a subsidiary of strata drilling llc for million in cash 
this acquisition included two drilling rigs as well as spare parts  inventory  drill pipe  and other major rig components 
the two drilling rigs are  horsepower  diesel electric drilling rigs with the capacity to drill  to  feet 
one drilling rig is currently operating and the other drilling rig will require approximately million in expenditures to complete 
this last drilling rig should be fully operational within days 
both drilling rigs will ultimately be placed into service in our rocky mountain division 
also in january  we completed the construction of a new  horsepower diesel electric drilling rig 
this drilling rig is now operating in our anadarko basin division 
the addition of this drilling rig  along with the two drilling rigs we acquired in the transaction with strata drilling  llc  brings our total rig fleet as of march  to drilling rigs 
we plan to start the construction of our th drilling rig in the first quarter of this drilling rig will be a  horsepower diesel electric drilling rig and  when completed  will be added to our rocky mountain division 
for our contract drilling operations during  we incurred million in capital expenditures  which includes million in connection with the sauer acquisition 
for  we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for our contract drilling operations 
acquisition of natural gas gathering and processing company 
in july  we consolidated and increased our natural gas gathering and processing business when we completed the acquisition of the of superior pipeline company  llc we did not already own 
we paid million in this acquisition 
before july  we had developed gathering systems which we have now consolidated with superior 
superior is a mid stream company engaged primarily in the purchasing  gathering  processing and treating of natural gas 
it operates one natural gas treatment plant  owns three processing plants  active gathering systems and miles of pipeline 
superior operates in oklahoma  texas and louisiana and has been in business since this acquisition and consolidation increases our ability to gather and market our natural gas as well as third party natural gas and construct or acquire existing natural gas gathering and processing facilities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements before this acquisition  our interest in the operations of superior was shown as equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments 
our investment  including our share of the equity in the earnings of this company  totaled million at december  and is reported in other assets on our accompanying balance sheet 
the results of operations for this acquired company are included in the statement of income for the period after july  and intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between business segments has been eliminated 
during  superior purchased million of our natural gas production and paid  for our natural gas liquids 
after the acquisition of superior  million of the natural gas purchased and  of the natural gas liquids purchased were eliminated 
for the year  we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for our natural gas gathering and processing operation with the focus on growing this segment through the construction of new facilities or acquisitions 
oil and natural gas limited partnerships and other entity relationships 
we are the general partner of oil and natural gas partnerships which were formed privately and publicly 
each partnership s revenues and costs are shared under formulas prescribed in its limited partnership agreement 
the partnerships repay us for contract drilling  well supervision and general and administrative expense 
related party transactions for contract drilling and well supervision fees are the related party s share of such costs 
these costs are billed on the same basis as billings to unrelated third parties for similar services 
general and administrative reimbursements consist of direct general and administrative expense incurred on the related party s behalf as well as indirect expenses assigned to the related parties 
allocations are based on the related party s level of activity and are considered by us to be reasonable 
during  and  the total paid to us for all of these fees was   and  respectively 
we expect that these fees in will be comparable to those in our proportionate share of assets  liabilities and net income relating to the oil and natural gas partnerships is included in our consolidated financial statements 
on august   we completed the sale of our investment in eagle energy partners i  lp for million 
in the third quarter of  a gain before income taxes of million was recognized in other revenues from this sale 
eagle marketed approximately of the natural gas volumes we sold for ourselves and other parties in critical accounting policies 
summary in this section  we have identified the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we will explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties oil and natural gas reserves estimates and related present value of future net revenues oil and gas properties accumulated dd a provision for dd a valuation of unproved properties impairment of proved and unproved properties long term debt and interest expense

it entails estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas 
these accumulations cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the degree of accuracy of these estimates depends on a number of factors  including  the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of the interpretations of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
annually  we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to audit our internal evaluation of our oil and natural gas reserves 
the techniques used in estimating oil and natural gas reserves annually depend on the nature and extent of available data and the accuracy of the estimates 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of oil and natural gas reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed non producing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable oil and natural gas reserves exceed the projected revenues from the oil and natural gas reserves 
but more significantly  the estimated present value of future cash flows from the oil and natural gas reserves is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be tied to the price received for oil and natural gas on the last day of the reporting period 
this requirement can result in significant changes from 
table of contents 
index to financial statements period to period given the volatile nature of oil and natural gas prices 
based on our year end oil and natural gas reserves  a decline in the oil price used to calculate our economically recoverable oil reserves will reduce our estimated oil reserves by  barrels and a decline in the price of natural gas used to calculate our natural gas reserves will reduce our estimated economically recoverable natural gas reserves by  mcf 
estimated future cash flows discounted at before income taxes would change by million 
we compute our provision for dd a on a units of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for our producing properties dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate x current period production oil and natural gas reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
at our production level of  equivalent mcf  a change in the amount of our oil and natural gas reserves would change our dd a rate by per mcfe and would change pre tax income by million annually 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling 
the ceiling is defined as the sum of the present value discount rate of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  based on period end oil and natural gas prices adjusted for hedging  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down cannot be reversed 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have large downward revisions in our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low oil or natural gas prices  even if temporary  increases the chance of a ceiling test write down 
based on oil and natural gas prices on december  per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for oil  the unamortized cost of our oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the ceiling of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
natural gas and oil prices remain erratic and any significant declines below prices used in the reserve evaluation could result in a ceiling test write down in following quarterly reporting periods 
we use the sales method for recording natural gas sales 
this method allows for recognition of revenue  which may be more or less than our share of pro rata production from certain wells 
our policy is to expense our pro rata share of lease operating costs from all wells as incurred 
such expenses relating to the natural gas balancing position on wells in which we have an imbalance are not material 
on january  the company adopted financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we own oil and natural gas properties which require costs to plug and abandon the wells when the oil and natural gas reserves in the wells are depleted 
these expenditures under fas are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled or acquired 
we do not have any assets restricted for the purpose of settling these plugging 
table of contents 
index to financial statements liabilities 
our engineering staff uses historical experience to determine estimated plugging costs taking into account the type of well either oil or natural gas  the depth of the well and physical location of the well within our areas of operation to determine the estimated plugging costs 
since the implementation of this standard  we have not plugged enough wells to make additional determinations as to the accuracy of the estimates 
drilling equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and enhancements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset  including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in these estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
an estimate of the impact to our earnings if other assumptions had been used is not practicable because of the significant number of assumptions that would be involved in the estimates 
because we do not bear the risk of completion of a well drilled under a daywork contract we recognize revenues and expense generated under daywork contracts as the services are performed 
under footage and turnkey contracts  we bear the risk of completion of the well  so revenues and expenses are recognized when the well is substantially completed 
substantial completion is determined when the well bore reaches the depth specified in the contract 
the entire amount of a loss  if any  is recorded when the loss can be reasonably determined  however  any profit is recorded only at the time the well is finished 
the costs of drilling contracts uncompleted at the end of the reporting period which includes expenses incurred to date on footage or turnkey contracts are included in other current assets 
in  we did not drill any footage or turnkey contracts 
effects of inflation the effect of inflation in the oil and natural gas industry is primarily driven by the prices for oil and natural gas 
increased commodity prices increase demand for contract drilling rigs and services which support higher drilling rig activity 
this in turn affects the overall demand for our drilling rigs and the dayrates we can obtain for our contract drilling services 
before  the effect of inflation on our operations was minimal due to low inflation rates  relatively low natural gas and oil prices and moderate demand for our contract drilling services 
over the last five years natural gas and oil prices have been more volatile  and during periods of higher utilization we have experienced increases in labor cost and the cost of services to support our drilling rigs 
during this same period  when commodity prices did decline labor rates did not come back down to the levels existing before the increases 
if natural gas prices increase substantially for a long period  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor will result in additional increases in our material and labor costs 
these conditions may limit our ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
how inflation will affect us in the future will depend on additional increases  if any  realized in our drilling rig rates and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas 
new accounting pronouncements on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties

 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we own oil and natural gas properties which require expenditures to plug and abandon the wells when the oil and natural gas reserves in the wells are depleted 
these expenditures under fas are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled or acquired

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
the price we receive is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and market prices applicable to our natural gas production 
historically  the prices we received for our oil and natural gas production have fluctuated and we expect these prices to continue to fluctuate 
the price of oil and natural gas also affects both the demand for our drilling rigs and the amount we can charge for the use of our drilling rigs 
based on our production  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
in an effort to try and reduce the impact of price fluctuations  over the past several years we have periodically used hedging strategies to hedge the price we will receive for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production 
a detailed explanation of those transactions has been included under hedging in the financial condition portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included above 
interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure relates to our long term debt  all of which bears interest at variable rates based on the jpmorgan chase prime rate or the libor rate 
at our election  borrowings under our revolving credit facility may be fixed at the libor rate for periods of up to days 
historically  we have not used any financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage our exposure to possible increases in interest rates 
however  in february  we entered into an interest rate swap to help manage our exposure to any future interest rate volatility 
a detailed explanation of this transaction has been included under hedging in the financial condition portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included above 
based on our average outstanding long term debt in  a change in the floating rate would reduce our annual pre tax cash flow by approximately
