overview our auto retail model is focused on acquiring average performing new vehicle franchised stores and then integrating and improving them 
our goal is to maximize the operations of all four departments of every store we acquire 
we have had success with this strategy since our initial public offering in late while our strategy has not changed over the last eight years  our ability to integrate and improve the stores that we acquire has increased dramatically 
we have also developed a better process for identifying acquisition targets that fit our operating model 
our cash position  substantial lines of credit  plus an experienced and well trained staff are all available to facilitate our continued growth as the opportunities develop 
in keeping with this model  we acquired stores with franchises during with total estimated annual revenues of approximately million 
historically  new vehicle sales have accounted for over half of our total revenues but less than one third of total gross profit 
we use a volume based strategy for new vehicle sales that was initiated in this strategy complements the goal of most auto manufacturers  which have continued to offer a high level of cash or other incentives on purchases 
for  we expect that manufacturers will continue to offer incentives on new vehicle sales through a combination of rebates and low interest rate loans to consumers 
since the beginning of  the used vehicle market has been negatively impacted by strong competition from the new vehicle market  with heavy manufacturer incentives in the form of cash rebates and low interest financing 
this trend in weak used vehicle unit demand continued throughout we have implemented new procedures in the used vehicle business to help offset recent negative trends as follows we have begun conducting our own local used vehicle auctions in select markets and managing the disposal of used vehicles at larger auctions 
we no longer allow individual stores to dispose of their excess inventories on their own 
the process is centralized and controlled at the management level 
we utilize a used vehicle promo pricing strategy  which markets vehicles with a down payment and then groups vehicles by payment level 
vehicles are marked with clear and understandable pricing  which reduces haggling and speeds up the sale process 
this strategy resolves the three biggest issues of price  down payment and monthly payment for our customers and our sales personnel in a simple way 
in addition  as a complement to our ongoing used vehicle operation at each store  we use specialists in our support services group to increase the acquisition of used vehicles 
we believe that this will help bolster sales volumes in the to year old vehicle range

the following tables set forth the changes in our operating results from continuing operations in compared to and in compared to year ended december  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease revenues new vehicle used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization income from operations floorplan interest expense other interest expense other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease new units sold average selling price per new vehicle used units sold average selling price per used vehicle finance and insurance sales per retail unit year ended december  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease revenues new vehicle used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization income from operations floorplan interest expense other interest expense other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease new units sold average selling price per new vehicle used units sold average selling price per used vehicle finance and insurance sales per retail unit revenues total revenues increased and  respectively  in compared to and in compared to  primarily as a result of acquisitions 
in addition  increases in the average new and used vehicle sales prices in compared to and in the average new vehicle sales prices in compared to contributed to the revenue increases 
the increase was offset by a same store sales decline of  while had a same store sales increase 
same store sales percentage increases decreases were as follows compared to compared to new vehicles used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts total sales same store sales are calculated by dealership comparing only those months that contain full month operating data 
the automotive retailing industry reported an increase in new vehicle sales of approximately in and a decline of in our new vehicle same store sales were down in because of a slower sales environment in our markets and a difficult comparison from the prior year of up 
used vehicle same store sales were negatively affected in both and because of continued manufacturer incentives on new vehicles which led to continued weakness in the used vehicle market 
penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter the improvements in same store service  body and parts revenue in compared to and in compared to were a result of our continued focus on service advisor training and our lifetime oil program 
we continue to experience positive same store sales growth in the customer pay side of the business 
conversely  improvements in the quality of chrysler  general motors  ford and toyota vehicles  which comprise approximately of our total new vehicle sales  have resulted in declines in warranty work for these brands 
other brands continue to demonstrate increases in same store warranty sales 
fleet and other sales include both fleet sales and fees received for delivering vehicles on behalf of the manufacturer  the us military  rent a car companies or leasing companies 
gross profit gross profit increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to due primarily to increased total revenues  as well as increases in our overall gross margin 
gross margins achieved were as follows year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicles bp retail used vehicles wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service and parts overall year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicles bp retail used vehicles wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service and parts overall bp stands for basis points one hundred basis points equals one percent 
the increase in the overall gross profit margin in compared to was a result of improvements in the margins achieved on our new and used vehicle businesses as well as on our service and parts business 
additionally  the increase in our high margin service and parts revenue as a percentage of total revenue also positively affected our gross margins 
because of the slower new vehicle sales environment in  we implemented internal directives aimed at generating more gross profit per vehicle sold 
we were able to achieve improved margins on our new vehicles in compared to this compares to a higher volume  lower margin strategy that was in place in in  we have been able to improve the margins on our used vehicle sales primarily because of the strategies discussed above regarding the auctioning of undesired used vehicles and our used vehicle promo pricing for our retail sales 
our focus on service advisor training  which has led to gains in sales of higher margin service items  and cost saving initiatives across all service  parts and body shop business lines has resulted in improved gross margins in this area in compared to our overall gross margin increased in compared to primarily because of increases in margins achieved on used vehicle sales as a result of selling older aged vehicles which carry a higher margin and improved inventory management 
the increase in the used vehicle gross margin also contributed to a same store increase in total gross profit dollars per used vehicle sold 
the improvements in our gross margin in were offset by the following factors a significant shift towards our lowest margin new vehicle business as a result of the strong incentive environment  lower floorplan interest credits from the manufacturers on new vehicles due to lower market rates  and aggressive pricing of new vehicles in order to gain market share  which resulted in lower new vehicle margins 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes salaries and related personnel expenses  facility lease expense  advertising net of manufacturer cooperative advertising credits  legal  accounting  professional services and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the increases in dollars spent are due to increased selling  or variable  expenses related to the increases in revenues and the number of locations  as well as increases related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sg a as a percentage of sales will increase when the service and parts revenue contribution increases relative to total sales due to its higher sg a component 
because of this  a better gauge is the trend of sg a as a percentage of gross profit 
sg a as a percentage of gross profit improved and basis points  respectively  in compared to and in compared to the increase as a percentage of revenue in compared to was also due partially to higher advertising and sales compensation expenses related to our aggressive new vehicle marketing during depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million and million  respectively  in compared to and in compared to due to the addition of property and equipment related to our acquisitions  as well as leasehold improvements to existing facilities 
income from operations operating margins in improved by basis points to compared to in and by basis points in from in the increases are primarily because of improved overall gross profit margin as discussed above  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
floorplan interest expense the million increase in floorplan interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from a million increase in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities  mainly due to acquisitions  and an increase of  resulting from our interest rate swaps 
in addition an increase in the average interest rates charged on our floorplan facilities increased floorplan interest expense by  the million increase in floorplan interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from an approximately million increase in expense as a result of an increase in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities  mainly because of acquisitions 
in addition  increased expense from interest rate swaps was responsible for million of the increase 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in the libor and the prime rates in compared to other interest expense other interest expense includes interest on our convertible notes  debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages  our used vehicle line of credit and equipment related notes 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to increased other interest expense by approximately  and changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million 
interest expense related to the million of convertible notes that were issued in may totals approximately  per quarter  which consists of  of contractual interest and  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to decreased other interest expense by  changes in the average outstanding balances in compared to resulted in increases to other interest expense of  income tax expense our effective tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate may be affected in the future by the mix of asset acquisitions compared to corporate acquisitions  as well as by the mix of states where our stores are located 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased in compared to as a result of improvements in gross margins that were partially offset by increased operating expenses and interest expense as discussed above 
income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue remained flat in compared to as a result of improvements in gross margins being offset by increased operating expenses 
discontinued operations during  we decided to sell certain stores and related franchises 
we recognized a net gain on the sale of one of our stores classified as discontinued operations totaling  net of tax  in  which is netted with loss from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we disposed of one of the franchises included with the store we had held for sale  which resulted in a gain of  net of tax 
in the fourth quarter of  we disposed of the remaining franchise  which resulted in a loss of  net of tax 
in addition  in  we recognized losses from operations of the discontinued operations of  and a  loss from discontinued operations that were disposed of in at december   we did not have any assets held for sale related to discontinued operations 
we continually monitor the performance of each of our stores and make determinations to sell based on return on capital criteria 
interest expense is allocated to stores classified in discontinued operations for actual flooring interest expense directly related to the new vehicles in the store 
interest expense related to the used vehicle line of credit is allocated based on total used vehicle inventory of the store  and interest expense related to the equipment line of credit is allocated based on the amount of fixed assets 
selected consolidated quarterly financial data the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly financial data 
three months ended  march june september december in thousands  except per share data revenues new vehicle used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization income from operations floorplan interest expense other interest expense other  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income before discontinued operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income basic income per share from continuing operations basic income loss per share from discontinued operations basic net income per share diluted income per share from continuing operations diluted income loss per share from discontinued operations diluted net income per share three months ended  march june september december in thousands except per share data revenues new vehicle used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization income from operations floorplan interest expense other interest expense other  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income before discontinued operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income basic income per share from continuing operations basic loss per share from discontinued operations basic net income per share diluted income per share from continuing operations diluted income loss per share from discontinued operations diluted net income per share quarterly data may not add to yearly totals due to rounding 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather in certain of our markets and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance is expected to be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the other quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt and consumer confidence  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
acquisitions have also been a contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as for working capital 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and the proceeds from public equity and private debt offerings to finance operations and expansion 
in addition  in may  we closed an million private debt offering 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit  cash received from our debt offering in may and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital requirements for at least to months from december  our inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to acquisitions and our decision to purchase a greater stock of vehicles in december of this was a strategic decision designed to strengthen our ties with our manufacturer partners  get a better allocation of popular models and have good inventories going into the spring selling season so we can take advantage of anticipated strong incentives 
our new and used flooring notes payable increased to million at december  from million at december  due to acquisitions and higher new vehicle days supply  partially offset by the use of the proceeds from our million convertible notes to pay down used vehicle flooring 
new vehicles are financed at approximately and used vehicles are financed at approximately of cost 
our days supply of new vehicles increased by approximately days at december  compared to december  our days supply of used vehicles increased by approximately day at december  compared to december  we believe that our new and used vehicle inventories are at appropriate levels at this time 
assets held for sale of  at december  relate to a building held for sale 
as a result of the acquisition of stores in  our goodwill and other intangibles increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash received  in was million 
our board of directors declared a dividend on our class a and class b common stock of per share for both the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  both of which were paid in and totaled approximately million each 
our board of directors also declared a dividend on our class a and class b common stock of per share for each of the second  third and fourth quarters of  two of which were paid in and one in march  and totaled approximately million each 
we anticipate recommending to the board of directors the approval of a cash dividend each quarter 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
through december  we have purchased a total of  shares under this program and may continue to do so from time to time in the future as conditions warrant 
however  the recent change in the tax law tends to equalize the benefits of dividends and share repurchases as a means to return capital or earnings to shareholders 
as a result  we believe it is now advantageous to shareholders to have a dividend in place 
with the dividend  we are able to offer an immediate and tangible return to our shareholders without reducing our already limited market float  which occurs when we repurchase shares 
we have a working capital and used vehicle flooring credit facility with daimlerchrysler services north america llc and toyota motor credit corporation  as amended in june  totaling up to million  which expires may  with an option for the lenders to extend to may   with interest due monthly 
this credit facility is cross collateralized and secured by cash and cash equivalents  new and used vehicles on a subordinated basis to the extent not specifically financed by other lenders  parts inventories  accounts receivable  intangible assets and equipment 
we pledged to daimlerchrysler services and toyota motor credit the stock of all of our dealership subsidiaries except entities operating bmw  honda  nissan or toyota stores 
the financial covenants in our agreement with daimlerchrysler services and toyota motor credit require us to maintain compliance with  among other things  i a specified current ratio  ii a specified fixed charge coverage ratio  iii a specified interest coverage ratio  iv a specified adjusted leverage ratio  and v certain working capital levels 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of this agreement 
ford motor credit  general motors acceptance corporation and volkswagen credit have agreed to floor all of our new vehicles for their respective brands with daimlerchrysler services north america llc and toyota motor credit corporation serving as the primary lenders for substantially all other brands 
these new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant brands 
we also have a revolving credit real estate line with toyota motor credit totaling million  which expires in may the advances are secured by the real estate financed under this line of credit 
we have a credit facility with us bank us  which provides for a million revolving line of credit for leased vehicles and equipment purchases and expires april  the financial covenants in our agreement with us bank us require us to maintain compliance with  among other things  i a specified current ratio  ii a specified fixed charge coverage ratio  iii a minimum total net worth  and iv a minimum tangible net worth 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of this agreement 
interest rates on all of the above facilities ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december  together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands outstanding at december  remaining availability as of december  new and program vehicle lines working capital and used vehicle line real estate line equipment leased vehicle line there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders 
in may  we sold million of senior subordinated convertible notes due through a rule a offering to qualified institutional buyers 
we will also pay contingent interest on the notes during any six month interest period beginning may   in which the trading price of the notes for a specified period of time equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
net proceeds from this offering were approximately million and were used to pay down our working capital and used vehicle line and new vehicle flooring notes payable 
the notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock at a price of per share upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and upon the occurrence of certain events as follows if  prior to may   and during any calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  if  after may   the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price  if  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon certain specified corporate events 
any declaration and payment of a dividend in excess of per share per quarter will result in an adjustment in the conversion rate for the notes 
the notes are redeemable at our option beginning may  at the redemption price of of the principal amount plus any accrued interest 
the holders of the notes can require us to repurchase all or some of the notes on may  and upon certain events constituting a fundamental change or a termination of trading 
a fundamental change is any transaction or event in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for  or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration that is not all  or substantially all  common stock that is listed on  or immediately after the transaction or event  will be listed on  a united states national securities exchange 
a termination of trading will have occurred if our common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market 
we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission on july  covering the resale of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission in october contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond floorplan notes lines of credit and long term debt interest on scheduled debt payments capital commitments operating leases our capital commitments of million at december  were for the construction of five new facilities  additions to three existing facilities and the remodel of one facility 
the new facilities will be for our chevrolet dealership in fairbanks  alaska  our toyota dealership in springfield  oregon  our chevrolet and hyundai dealerships in odessa  texas and a body shop also in odessa  texas 
we have already incurred million for these projects and anticipate incurring the remaining million in we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances until completion of the projects  at which time we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended 
in addition  we have recorded a reserve for our estimated contractual obligations related to potential charge backs for vehicle service contracts  lifetime oil change contracts and other various insurance contracts that are terminated early by the customer 
at december   this reserve totaled million 
based on past experience  we estimate that the million will be paid out as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include service contract and lifetime oil contract income recognition  finance fee income recognition  workers compensation insurance premium accrual  executive bonus accrual  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  and used vehicle inventory valuations 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and other revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
service contract and lifetime oil change contract income recognition we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil contracts to customers 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
at december  and  this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit  pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  that would be recognized as income upon receipt 
finance fee income recognition we receive finance fees from various financial institutions when we arrange financing for our customers on a non recourse basis 
we may be charged back for a portion of the financing fee income when the customer pays off their loan prior to the guidelines agreed to by the various financial institutions 
we have established a reserve for potential net charge backs and cancellations based on historical experience  which typically result if the customer pays off their loan during the to days after receiving financing 
at december  and  this reserve totaled  and  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
workers compensation insurance premium accrual insurance premiums are paid for under a three year retrospective cost policy  whereby premium cost depends on experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating  although the actual experience can be something greater or less than the anticipated claims experience and  as of december   the accrual was million 
we expect that the retrospective cost policy  as opposed to a guaranteed cost with a flat premium  will be the most cost efficient over time 
executive bonuses we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment  and the level thereof  of the annual bonus criteria under our discretionary executive bonus program in order to record bonus expense on a quarterly basis 
we accrue the estimated year end expense on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on bonus attainment expectations 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration the historical seasonality of our business and current trends 
if actual year end results differ materially from our estimates  the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated 
the bonus accrual at the end of any given year is accurate and reflective of actual results attained 
intangible assets we review our goodwill and other identifiable non amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value based test using discounted estimated cash flows 
discounted future cash flows are prepared by applying a growth rate to historical revenues 
growth rates are calculated individually for each region with data derived from the us census bureau on population growth and the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from a capital asset pricing model which factors in an equity risk premium and a risk free rate 
the review is conducted more frequently than annually if events or circumstances occur that warrant a review 
our other identifiable intangible assets primarily include the franchise value of the business units  which is considered to have an indefinite life and not subject to amortization  but rather is included in the fair value based testing 
impairment could occur if the operating business unit does not meet the determined fair value testing 
at such point  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value 
during and  we concluded that there was no impairment 
at december  and  goodwill and other identifiable non amortizable intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
used vehicle inventory used vehicle inventories are stated at cost plus the cost of any equipment added  reconditioning and transportation 
we select a sampling of dealerships throughout the year to perform quarterly testing of book values against market valuations utilizing the kelly blue book and nada guidelines 
used vehicle inventory values are cyclical and could experience impairment when market valuations are significantly below inventory costs 
historically  we have not experienced significant write downs on our used vehicle inventory 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory and certain real estate holdings 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable  variable rate mortgage notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding at december fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we could refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
based on open market trades  we determined that our million of long term convertible fixed interest rate debt issued in may had a fair market value of approximately million at december  in addition  at december   we had million of other long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding with maturity dates of between november and may based on discounted cash flows  we have determined that the fair market value of this long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not speculate using derivative instruments 
as of december   we have outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective september  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective february  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month 
we earn interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount of deferred gains and losses at december  were million and  respectively 
the difference between interest earned and the interest obligation results in a monthly settlement which is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations as incremental flooring interest expense 
the resulting cash settlement reduces the amount of deferred gains and losses 
because the critical terms of the interest rate swaps and the underlying debt obligations are the same  there was no ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense 
if  in the future  the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination date  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  we would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the deferred gains or losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
incremental flooring interest expense recognized  net of tax  related to the reclassification of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income was million  million and million  respectively  in  and interest expense savings  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of decreasing interest rates  based on interest rates effective as of january  was approximately  million and  respectively  in  and interest expense savings  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of decreasing interest rates  based on interest rates effective as of january of each year was  and  respectively  in and interest expense  net of tax  on un hedged debt increased during by approximately  as a result of increasing interest rates during as of december   approximately of our total debt outstanding was subject to un hedged variable rates of interest 
at current interest rates  we estimate that we will incur additional interest expense  net of tax  of approximately million related to our interest rate swaps during risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
