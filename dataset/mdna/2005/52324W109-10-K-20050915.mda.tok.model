we sell our products and provide service worldwide through wholly owned subsidiaries  representatives and distributors 
we develop  manufacture  sell and license high performance oscilloscopes and global communication protocol analyzers 
our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high performance systems  validate electronic designs and improve time to market 
through the quarter ended march   we offered four families of oscilloscopes  which address different solutions for the markets we serve wavemaster  one of our high performance product families  wavepro  which is targeted at the mid to high performance sector  waverunner  designed for the mid performance sector  and wavesurfer  designed for value oriented users in the low performance bandwidth sector of the market 
our protocol analyzers are used to reliably and accurately monitor communications traffic and diagnose operational problems in a variety of communications devices to ensure that they comply with industry standards 
our protocol analyzers are used by designers and engineers whose products are in development and production and also for products deployed in the field 
on april   we launched a fifth family of oscilloscopes  the waveexpert  which is our highest performance oscilloscope targeted at design engineers requiring a high bandwidth  accurate  fast and flexible sampling oscilloscope 
we generate revenue in a single segment within the test and measurement market  primarily from the sale of our oscilloscopes  protocol analyzers  probes  accessories  and applications solutions 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from the sales of our extended warranty  maintenance contracts and repairs and calibrations on our instruments after their warranties expire 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers and other revenue recognition criteria are met  net of allowances for anticipated returns 
we sell our products into a broad range of end markets  including computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace 
we believe designers in all of these markets are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require 
our customers include leading original equipment manufacturers  such as bae systems  ibm  maxtor  raytheon  robert bosch  seagate  samsung and siemens vdo 
test and measurement market test and measurement equipment is used in the design  development  manufacture  deployment and operation of electronic products and systems 
this equipment is required to verify functionality and performance of new product designs and to ensure compliance to industry standards and overall product quality 
these instruments are used across all electronic equipment industries  including computer  semiconductor  communications  consumer  automotive  defense  and video 
in addition  test and measurement instruments are utilized to install  maintain and monitor wireless and wireline communications and broadcast networks 
these test and measurement equipment products aid in the research and development of new products  testing of products in production  and maintenance and service of products in the field 
according to prime data  inc  an independent market research firm tracking the test and measurement industry  the market for this equipment exceeded billion in certain segments of the test and measurement industry have historically experienced greater volatility than the overall industry because of their exposure to certain end markets  such as communications  that experienced rapid growth in the late s  followed by rapid declines 
growth in the test and measurement market is driven by improvements in electronic systems performance  growth in the electronics market and emerging technologies and standards 
designers in a wide variety of industries are being constantly driven to increase the performance of their products and to add new features and capabilities 
these improvements rely on advanced semiconductor technology and require the design of faster  more powerful and complex electronic systems 
as a result  the underlying technological advances in communications and electronic signals are increasing exponentially in complexity and speed 
this is driving the demand for analysis tools that allow designers and manufacturers of these devices to improve new product cycle time 
with each advance in technology  engineers designing next generation technologies and products must contend with both a reduced margin for error and a progressively more difficult task of fully characterizing new product design 
while the overall market for test and measurement equipment is made up of hundreds of different types of instruments and measurement tools  the largest single product category is oscilloscopes 
we estimate that oscilloscopes represented approximately million of the overall billion market in in addition  protocol analyzers  an emerging product category represented approximately million in sales in protocol analyzers address specific communications standards in the wide area network wan  local area network lan  storage area network san and computer peripheral interconnect market spaces 
lecroy presently focuses on the computer peripheral interconnect space 
we believe the potential for these products lies somewhere in the to million range of the total protocol analyzer product category 
oscilloscope product category oscilloscopes are the primary instrument used by engineers for testing and analyzing electronic signals 
we believe the market for oscilloscope products will reach billion in historically  oscilloscope products within the test and measurement industry have experienced less volatility than the industry as a whole because of their widespread use across many applications and end markets 
thorough testing of complex electronic signals requires a measurement tool capable of physically attaching to the signal of interest  capturing data with high resolution for long periods of time and supporting detailed signal analysis while providing additional insight into data characteristics and signal trends over time 
an oscilloscope utilizes a graphical display device that allows an engineer to view an electronic signal 
the most basic display of an oscilloscope plots a signal s voltage versus time typically in billionths and trillionths of a second  providing a user insight into the performance of an electronic circuit 
in many cases  a user is trying to either verify that the circuit is behaving as designed or measure the signal to gain a basic understanding of signal performance 
today s oscilloscopes are digital devices which capture electronic signals and convert the voltage values to digital representations  which are stored in computer memory  allowing the instrument not only to display the signal on a screen  but also to utilize a computer to analyze the signal s characteristics 
the ability of an oscilloscope to conduct in depth analysis of a complex electronic signal s characteristics and trends is referred to as wave shape analysis  which is increasingly important as signals become more complex 
the three primary specifications of an oscilloscope are its bandwidth  or capacity to capture a signal of a particular speed  sample rate  or number of data points that can be captured within a specific time  and memory length  or the number of points per channel 
higher bandwidths allow capture of higher speed signals  increased sample rate improves resolution  and longer memory allows capture of longer  more complex signals 
the merit of a specific oscilloscope depends on the combination of these specifications 
oscilloscopes with real time bandwidths ranging from megahertz mhz up to gigahertz ghz are currently available 
generally  the prices of oscilloscopes increase as the primary specifications increase 
we believe the oscilloscope market can be generally divided into four major categories o high end oscilloscopes 
the largest part of the market  which we believe currently accounts for slightly more than half of the market based on revenues generated  comprises instruments with the ability to capture and analyze signals ranging from mhz up to the highest available real time bandwidths 
these instruments generally sell from  up to over  depending on their capabilities 
o lower end oscilloscopes 
we believe about one third of the market s revenue comes from these products which include less complex instruments with the ability to capture and analyze signals ranging from mhz to mhz 
these instruments generally sell for below  o handheld oscilloscopes 
the lowest end of the market includes a variety of handheld oscilloscopes which we believe currently comprise less than of the overall market 
selling prices for these handheld instruments are generally between  and  o sampling oscilloscopes 
for certain high signal speed applications  such as optical communications  instruments with bandwidths of up to ghz are required 
at these speeds  real time oscilloscopes do not have the ability to track the signal shape in real time and take samples quickly enough to be effective 
we believe this category currently comprises less than of the overall market  but because of their ability to provide extremely high bandwidths  sampling oscilloscopes can range in price generally from  to  protocol analyzer product category the demand for digital information has accelerated the need for communication among multiple electronic devices in various markets  including computers  telecommunications  networking  storage  consumer electronics  aerospace  automotive  industrial automation and medical instrumentation 
this growing demand centers on the widespread need to transmit digital information 
communication among digital devices  or connectivity  occurs over a variety of physical media  such as copper wire and fiber optic cable  as well as over wireless frequencies 
computer technology initially provided connectivity only among internal devices  such as the processor  memory and storage  and with external peripheral devices  such as the keyboard  mouse and printer 
today  computer technology also enables connectivity among multiple computing devices and across networks  such as local area networks  wide area networks  storage area networks  home area networks  personal area networks and the internet 
telecommunications technology also enables connectivity among multiple devices  such as telephones  fax machines  pagers and personal digital assistants 
consumer electronics technology is progressively enabling connectivity among devices  such as internet appliances  digital cameras  audio systems and televisions 
digital devices communicate by sending electronic signals through a transmission channel according to a specified protocol 
a protocol is a set of detailed rules that governs and regulates the manner in which the signals are sent  received  and interpreted 
the channel and the protocol are both typically specified in a formal communications standard 
for communication to be successful  each device must implement and conform to the same standard 
early communications standards were relatively simple  typically involving low speed communications between two simple devices connected directly by copper wire 
current standards are increasingly complex  typically involving high speed communications among multiple sophisticated devices indirectly linked to other devices and across various physical media  including copper wire  fiber optic cables  and wireless technologies with rapidly fluctuating frequencies 
as a result  standards that were specified initially in only a few pages of text may now extend to over one thousand pages 
the specifications for these standards are broadly available  which facilitates interoperability of hardware and software products from different manufacturers 
a standard is typically introduced by several leading technology and infrastructure companies 
these core promoter companies comprise the nucleus of independent standards groups 
these groups are sometimes referred to as implementers forums  trade associations or special interest groups which assist in the development  implementation  promotion  and compliance with the standards 
as commercial interest in a standard increases  the communications standards group typically expands to include system and device manufacturers and service providers 
the promoter companies typically remain closely associated with the standard throughout its lifecycle 
a standard is implemented over a lifecycle that includes three overlapping phases development  production and market deployment 
during the development phase  key component manufacturers develop and produce important building blocks such as semiconductors  embedded software  protocol stacks and device drivers which will be used by others in the industry to create products 
during the production phase  system and device manufacturers apply these building blocks to construct their unique products and applications 
the market deployment phase includes the introduction and sale of products and applications to end users in the market 
similarly  products associated with a particular standard follow their own unique lifecycle from development through production and deployment 
protocol analyzers are standard specific tools  they enable a design engineer to analyze the conversation between two devices 
many distinct communications standards are emerging to meet the growing demand for digital connectivity in the computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace industries 
the characteristics of each standard  including its principal uses  physical medium  transmission speed and distance covered  vary greatly

we purchase a small number of parts from single source suppliers 
in particular  several key integrated circuits that we use are made by ibm 
although we have not experienced significant production delays attributable to supply changes  we believe that  for integrated circuits in particular  alternative sources of supply would be difficult to develop over a short period of time 
because we have no direct control over our third party suppliers  interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these third parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion 
in addition  if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary parts or products  we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such parts or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers 
in such events  we could experience interruptions  delays  increased costs or quality control problems and loss of revenues 
competition oscilloscopes the oscilloscope market is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and continual advances in technology 
our principal competitors in this market are tektronix  inc tektronix and agilent technologies  inc 
agilent 
both of our principal competitors have substantially greater sales and marketing  development and financial resources than we do

we believe that the principal bases of competition in the oscilloscope market are a product s performance characterized by the confluence of bandwidth  sample rate  memory length and processing power  its price and quality  the vendor s name recognition and reputation  product availability and the quality of post sale support 
we believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of the principal bases of competition in the oscilloscope market in the general price range  to  in which our oscilloscopes are focused 
we also believe that our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain and develop the advanced technology used in our oscilloscope products and our ability to offer high performance products at a favorable price to performance ratio 
protocol analyzers our protocol analyzer markets are highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we compete with a number of companies  with agilent and finisar corporation representing the largest competitors 
these competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various segments of this marketplace 
we believe the principal factors of competition include o product functionality  o time to market with new products  o ease of product use  o product speed  reliability  stability and accuracy  o price performance  o flexibility and programmability of products  o upgradeability of products  o local support and service for products  and o breadth of product offerings 
we believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors and have gained significant market share in some of our target markets as a result 
we believe our success has been driven by our vertically integrated technology  ability to generate customer loyalty and ability to anticipate market trends 
backlog our backlog of unshipped customer orders was approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
backlog at june  and excludes million and million  respectively  of deferred revenue established in connection with the adoption of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  in fiscal customers may cancel orders at any time 
we believe that our level of backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of our future operating performance 
patents  trademarks and licenses we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods  as well as technical expertise and continuing technological research and development to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products 
we believe  however  that because of the rapid pace of change and advancement in oscilloscope technology  legal intellectual property protection is and will continue to be a less significant factor in our success than our core competency of wave shape analysis and the experience and expertise of our personnel 
we protect significant technologies  products and processes that we consider important to our business by  among other things  filing applications for patent protection 
we currently hold us and foreign patents  and approximately pending applications covering a range of products with various expiration dates 
although none of our products depends exclusively on any single patent  we believe our patents  in the aggregate  are important to our business and contribute to our competitive advantage 
we license or otherwise acquire key enabling technologies from third parties in order to gain access to technologies that would be too expensive or too time consuming to develop internally or that would give us a competitive advantage or shorten our product development time to market 
we are currently party to a license agreement with perigee llc pursuant to which we license fast data readout technology for use in our waverunner series family of products 
this license is perpetual 
we also license a patent from william a 
farnbach  which relates to the triggering characteristics of an oscilloscope 
this license extends for the term of the patent  which expires in october in june  we entered into a technology development agreement with ibm  as described in more detail in the business technology and product development section  in order to gain access to ibm s next generation silicon germanium technology 
with the exception of our technology development agreement with ibm  the capabilities licensed or otherwise acquired through these agreements  and additional license agreements we entered into  could be developed by us  but would require considerable time and expense 
from time to time  we license our technology to third parties 
the revenue generated from these licenses is a small percentage of our total revenue 
we generally do not actively seek out licensing opportunities  but will take advantage of opportunities that arise in the normal course of business 
currently  we are actively supplying oscilloscope components and software support to iwatsu  with whom we maintain a strategic alliance in japan  pursuant to long standing joint development agreements with iwatsu 
the license contained in our agreement with iwatsu is perpetual 
although we believe that our products and technologies do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us based on the infringement or alleged infringement of any such rights 
such claims are typically costly to defend  regardless of the legal outcome 
there can be no assurance that we would prevail with respect to any such claim  or that a license to third party rights  if needed  would be available on acceptable terms 
in any event  patent and proprietary rights litigation can be extremely protracted and expensive 
regulation as we manufacture our products in the united states and sell our products and purchase parts  components and sub assemblies in a number of countries  we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements  particularly the imposition of tariffs and customs  in a variety of countries 
our products are also subject to united states export control restrictions 
in certain cases  we may not be permitted to export products without obtaining an export license 
us export laws also prohibit the export of our products to a number of countries deemed by the united states to be hostile 
the export of our high performance oscilloscopes from the united states is also subject to regulation under the treaty for nuclear non proliferation 
we cannot be certain that the us government will approve any pending or future export license requests 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised 
employees as of june   we had full time employees  of whom work in our chestnut ridge  new york facility 
our employees are not represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory

the company filed a counterclaim on august   claiming infringement by tektronix on three of the company s patents 
on november   the company filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement concerning one of the six tektronix patents 
in response  tektronix filed a cross motion for summary judgment of infringement by the company concerning the same patent 
by order dated may   the court granted the company s motion for summary judgment of noninfringement and denied tektronix cross motion for summary judgment of infringement 
on april   all claims related to two of the tektronix patents were voluntarily dismissed from the tektronix complaint and the company s counterclaim

overview we were founded in to develop  manufacture and sell high performance signal analysis tools to scientists engaged in high energy physics research 
in we introduced our first oscilloscope using our core competency of designing signal acquisition and digitizing technology 
we are a leading  worldwide provider of oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers as well as a provider of related test and measurement equipment and currently operate as one business segment in the test and measurement market 
our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high performance systems  to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market 
we currently offer five families of oscilloscopes  which address different solutions to the markets we serve waveexpert  a powerful family of sampling oscilloscopes and modules  wavemaster  our highest performance product family  wavepro  which is targeted at the mid to high performance sector  waverunner  designed for the mid performance sector  and wavesurfer  designed for the low performance sector of the market 
our protocol analyzers are tools used by designers and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over high speed serial data interfaces  including usb  bluetooth  pci express  serial ata  serial attached scsi sas  and others 
we sell our products into a broad range of end markets  including computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace markets 
we believe that our products offer the strongest value proposition in these markets by providing advanced analysis capabilities coupled with innovative and proprietary technology features 
we believe designers in all of these markets are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require 
our customers include leading original equipment manufacturers  such as bae systems  ibm  maxtor  raytheon  robert bosch  seagate  samsung and siemens vdo 
we employ a direct sales model utilizing a highly skilled global sales force where it makes economic sense to do so 
we supplement our direct sales force with a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors in areas where demand levels do not justify direct distribution 
we divide the world into four areas north america  europe middle east  japan and asia pacific 
in north america we primarily sell our products directly in the united states 
in europe middle east  we sell our products directly in switzerland  germany  italy  france  the united kingdom and sweden 
in japan  we sell our products directly 
in asia pacific  we sell our products directly in south korea  singapore and five regions in china 
we generate revenue in a single segment within the test and measurement market  primarily from the sale of our oscilloscopes  protocol analyzers  probes  accessories  and applications solutions 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from the sales of our extended warranty  maintenance contracts and repairs and calibrations on our instruments after their warranties expire 
generally  we transact revenues and pay our operating expenses in the local currencies of the countries in which we have a direct distribution presence or other operations  with limited exceptions  most notably in china where our sales and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
in europe middle east  we transact business in euros  swiss francs  british pounds  swedish krona and us dollars 
in japan  we transact business in japanese yen 
in south korea  we transact business in korean won and in singapore  we transact business in both us dollars and singapore dollars 
for a discussion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  see item a of this part ii entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
historically  we have  at times  experienced lower levels of demand during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  has been principally due to the lower level of general market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
cost of revenues represents manufacturing and service costs  which primarily comprise materials  labor and factory overhead 
gross profits represent revenues less cost of revenues 
additional factors integral to gross profit earned on our products are mix  as the list prices of our products range from  to  and the effects of foreign currencies  as approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived overseas  much of which is denominated in local currencies while product manufacturing costs are primarily us dollar denominated 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel as well as legal  accounting and other professional services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of masks  wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected by a variety of factors 
as discussed below  we believe the most significant recurring factors are the economic strength of the technology markets into which we sell our products  our ability to identify market demands timely and develop competitive products to meet those demands  the announcements and actions of our competitors and our ability to enter into new markets and broaden our presence in existing markets 
our sales are largely dependent on the health and growth of technology companies whose operations tend to be cyclical 
consequently  demand for our products tends to coincide with the increase or decrease in capital spending in the technology industry 
for example  in the late s through  our business expanded along with the prosperity of the technology markets 
from early to  demand for our products decreased along with the contraction of the technology industry overall 
as a result  our revenues decreased from the end of fiscal year through fiscal year beginning in fiscal year our revenues have significantly increased concurrently with the recovery of the technology industry 
we believe our ongoing strategy of quickly identifying opportunities and customer needs in fundamental technology markets and capitalizing on those opportunities through well planned  efficient and timely key product introductions has also contributed to our recent increase in revenues 
for instance  in october  in anticipation of renewed but tentative capital spending in the technology industry  we introduced our waverunner family of oscilloscopes  a unique software platform built upon a solid hardware platform designed to take advantage of demand for mid tier competitively priced  powerful oscilloscopes 
to date  sales of waverunner oscilloscopes have exceeded our expectations 
in addition  in response to fluctuations in the technology markets we target  we continually assess and adopt programs aimed at positioning us for long term success 
these programs may include streamlining operations  discontinuing older and less profitable product lines  and reducing operating expenses from time to time 
as an example  in fiscal and we implemented restructuring and business realignment plans intended to reduce costs and more efficiently allocate product development resources 
for a more detailed discussion of our restructuring efforts in fiscal and  see the section entitled restructuring and asset impairment  below 
we face significant competition in our target markets 
we believe that in order to continue to compete successfully  we need to timely anticipate  recognize and respond to changing market demands by providing products that serve our customers needs as they arise at prices acceptable to the market 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competition in each of these areas 
consequently  we are constantly reviewing our product development strategy and invest time  resources and capital in development projects we deem most likely to succeed 
in furtherance of our drive to meet our customers changing demands  we also look outside our organization for opportunities to expand our markets 
accordingly  on october   we completed the acquisition of catc to complement our expanding portfolio of serial data test solutions 
the acquisition of catc is described more fully below 
catc acquisition on october   we completed our acquisition of of the outstanding common stock of catc via the merger of a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of lecroy with and into catc  with catc surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of lecroy the merger 
catc is a provider of advanced verification systems for existing and emerging digital communications standards 
catc s products are used by semiconductor  device  system and software companies at each phase of their products lifecycles from development through production and market deployment 
catc had approximately employees at the time of the merger 
through our acquisition of catc  we expect to capitalize on the increasing demand for serial data test instruments  leverage our global  technical  direct sales force to accelerate the growth of catc s products  strengthen our position in the data storage market  increase penetration into the computer market  expand gross profit  increase operating leverage leading to expanded operating profit and increase cash generation capabilities 
total consideration paid to acquire catc was approximately million 
the merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires that the total consideration be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
on the effective date of the merger  each share of catc common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior thereto was canceled and converted into the right to receive in cash 
in addition  we paid cash to the holders of catc s outstanding  vested  in the money stock options and employee stock purchase plan the espp purchase rights 
further  we assumed catc s outstanding unvested stock options  as well as certain vested but unexercised stock options  by granting to catc employees a total of  options to purchase lecroy common stock the lecroy options 
the lecroy options were recorded at their fair values using the black scholes option pricing model based on a stock price of per share  which was the closing price of lecroy common stock on october   less the intrinsic value of unvested options  which will be charged as compensation expense to operations as earned by employees over their remaining vesting periods 
lecroy paid cash of million  net of cash acquired  using million of cash on hand and borrowings of million under our million senior  secured  five year credit agreement entered into on october   with the lenders listed therein and the bank of new york  as administrative agent for such lenders the credit agreement 
the merger consideration is summarized below in thousands cash for shares  cash for options and espp purchase rights  fair value of stock options assumed  unearned stock compensation on unvested options assumed  transaction costs  total purchase price  the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was established based upon the unaudited october  consolidated balance sheet of catc  as well as certain assumptions made regarding fair values 
the fair value of finished goods and work in process inventory was based on estimated selling prices less direct costs to sell and a reasonable profit margin on the selling effort 
the fair value of the in process research and development ipr d  purchased technology  trade name and purchase orders was determined by an independent appraisal firm 
the fair value of the ipr d was based on the total estimated costs to develop the related technologies less the costs incurred to date for the projects  and the intangible asset values were based on estimates of future cash flows associated with those assets 
the purchased technology  trade name and purchase orders related to this acquisition are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives ranging from two to twenty nine months 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
the principal factors that contributed to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill was the fair value of the going concern element of the catc business  which includes the assembled workforce and their technology position within emerging communication standards  as well as the expected synergies that will be achieved by combining both companies 
the goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reduced its catc goodwill by approximately million as a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance against the catc deferred tax assets and a reversal of a pre acquisition contingency reserve 
the purchase price allocation is summarized below in thousands cash  accounts receivable  inventory  other current assets fixed assets other assets deferred tax asset  net in process research and development  purchased technology  purchased trade name purchased purchase orders goodwill  current liabilities assumed  long term liabilities assumed total purchase price  the following table presents the details of the amortizable intangible assets acquired in the merger and their carrying value as of june  weighted accumulated average lives cost amortization net in thousands amortizable intangible assets purchased technology years    purchased tradename year purchased purchase orders years total intangibles purchased    amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in the merger was million for the year ended june  amortization expense for the intangible assets acquired in the merger has been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as follows year ended june  in thousands cost of revenues  general and administrative expense total  the amortization expense of intangible assets acquired in the merger for future years is as follows amount fiscal year in thousands the million allocated to ipr d was written off during the second quarter of fiscal in accordance with fasb interpretation no

this charge is included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
restructuring and asset impairment in response to the continued economic downturn in  we took steps to change our manufacturing strategy  discontinue older product lines and reduce our operating expenses in an effort to position our business better for the long term 
in the second quarter of fiscal  in connection with the merger  we took steps to change our organization as well as implement a change in our low to mid range oscilloscope manufacturing strategy 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we experienced a decline in test and measurement product orders and we responded by taking action to better align our overseas operations  reducing headcount and closing two offices 
the resultant charges taken to accomplish these efforts were fiscal year in thousands charges for impaired intangible assets   service center closure severance and related costs cost of revenues   charges for severance and related costs research and development charges for severance and related costs   facility closure unused restructuring reserve selling  general and administrative 
  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted a plan to consolidate our probe development activities into our chestnut ridge  new york facility 
in connection with this plan  we closed our beaverton  oregon facility and recorded lease termination costs of million and a charge for severance of million million of which was recorded in cost of revenues  million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense and million was recorded in research and development expense 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of employees or approximately of the workforce as compared to june  final payments for severance under this plan occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted a plan to scale down fixed infrastructure due to the difficult economic environment and to implement new management operating systems designed to improve processes in sales  order management  customer relationship management and financial performance management 
in connection with the adoption of this plan  we recorded a charge for severance and other related expenses in the first quarter of fiscal of million million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense and million was recorded in research and development expense 
the plan implemented during fiscal resulted in improved operating efficiencies and headcount reductions of employees or approximately of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   all but  of the accrued amounts for severance and related costs and plant closure costs related to the first quarter of fiscal restructuring has been paid 
this remaining amount will be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the majority of payments was for severance and was paid as follows million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
additionally  on november  we entered into a lease termination agreement and made a final payment of approximately million releasing us from any future rental obligations under the beaverton  oregon facility lease 
this amount had been previously accrued 
also during fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights and a million charge for a related future royalty payment 
the impairment resulted from our strategic decision to exit certain older product lines and to make significant changes to our manufacturing strategy to improve further our operating efficiency 
we estimated the fair value of the impaired asset based on the present value of forecasted future cash inflows using a discount rate commensurate with our weighted average cost of capital 
in addition  we reversed million of unused fiscal restructuring reserves to selling  general and administrative expense 
no similar charges were incurred in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the merger  we adopted a plan to restructure our organization and refine our product strategy 
in connection with the adoption of this plan  we recorded a charge for severance and other related expenses in fiscal of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expense 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of six employees or approximately of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   approximately million of severance has been paid and approximately million remains in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
severance and other related amounts under this plan will be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we realigned some of our business processes and  as a result  incurred expenses of approximately million  consisting of million of severance and related expenses and million of facility closure expenses which includes lease termination costs and asset write downs of which million was recorded in cost of revenues  million was recorded in selling  general and administrative and million was recorded in research and development 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of employees or approximately of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   approximately million of severance has been paid and million of facility charges have been paid in cash or written off and approximately million remains in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
finally  in fiscal  as a result of a change in our organization stemming from the merger and a subsequent change in our low to mid range oscilloscope manufacturing strategy  we took a million non cash charge to cost of revenues for the write off of a technology asset 
these restructuring and business realignment charges represent our best efforts to respond to the current demands in our industry 
however  these and future cost reductions  or other benefits expected from the restructuring  may be insufficient to align our operations with customer demand and the changes affecting our industry  or may be more costly or extensive than currently anticipated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s judgment and available information and  consequently  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products  services  and other arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of allowances for anticipated returns  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
through march   we deferred revenue on shipments of our wavesurfer family of oscilloscopes until they were sold by the distributor to their customers sell through method because of the associated uncertainty about sell through volumes which precluded us from being able to sufficiently estimate the amounts of potential product returns due to the fact that this was a new product distributed via a new channel 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  since we had four full quarters of experience with this product and channel with no significant returns  we had sufficient data to estimate potential returns 
therefore  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we recognized previously deferred revenue of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use relative fair values to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
due to the significant software content of its protocol analyzer products  the company recognizes revenue on the sale of these products in accordance with sop upon shipment provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
when the company ships a protocol analyzer but certain elements relating to the functionality of the product are not delivered  revenue and the associated cost of revenue are deferred until the remaining elements are delivered 
software maintenance support revenue is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods 
provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time products are recognized as revenue 
revenues from protocol analyzer products are included in test and measurement products in the consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable which we estimate is non collectible 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes the allowance for anticipated returns  was approximately million at june  and june  changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
our marketing department plays a key role in our inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with our manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
based upon management s forecast  inventory items no longer expected to be used in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventory s quantity and its forecasted usage are classified as excess 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at june  and  respectively 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required 
deferred tax assets 
we have recorded million of net deferred tax assets as of june  for the future tax benefits of certain expenses reported for financial statement purposes that have not yet been deducted on our tax returns 
significant components of our deferred tax assets are federal  state and foreign net operating loss and credit carryforwards  inventory reserves and other reserves 
the recognition of this deferred tax asset is based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income within statutory carryforward periods to realize the benefit of these tax deductions 
the factors that management considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this information  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june  to reserve for certain tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realizable amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
such adjustments may be material to our results of operations when made 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the cost of technology  manufacturing and distribution rights acquired is amortized primarily on the basis of the higher of units shipped over the contract periods or on a straight line basis not to exceed five years 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives including technology  manufacturing and distribution rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
management estimates the undiscounted cash flows of these rights on the basis of actual and forecasted production units as well as the average selling price and standard costs of the related products after the amortization of the rights to determine profitability 
if required  an impairment charge is recorded as described below 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceed the fair value 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance by us relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we recognized an intangible asset impairment of million in fiscal  due to a change in product strategy  which eliminated the usefulness and value of the asset 
goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually under a two step approach  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level as described in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we have one reporting unit for the purposes of sfas no 
because none of the components of our operating segment constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations 
the first step is to identify if an impairment of goodwill has occurred by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in this second step  the implied fair value as defined in sfas no 
of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we completed the annual impairment test required under sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal after completion of our annual financial operating plan and determined that there was no impairment to our recorded goodwill balance of million at june  we use a fair value based test using our market capitalization to estimate the company s fair value 
there were no impairment indicators during the fiscal year ended june  warranty 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability 
the expected failure is arrived at in terms of units  which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required 
on a quarterly basis  we study trends of warranty claims  review estimates of costs to repair and take action to improve the quality of our products and minimize our warranty exposure 
the warranty reserve was million and million at june  and  respectively 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of our total revenues for the fiscal years indicated year ended june  revenues test and measurement products service and other total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative legal settlement research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other  net other expense income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations gain from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss charges related to convertible preferred stock net income loss applicable to common stockholders certain prior year amounts have been reclassified from service revenue to product revenue to conform to the fiscal presentation 
these reclassifications had no impact on previously reported total revenues 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million for the year ended june   compared to million in the prior year  an increase of  or million 
revenues from test and measurement products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase in product revenue was primarily due to an approximate increase in total oscilloscope units shipped  mainly attributable to the wavesurfer product line launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as the incremental revenue generated from the sales of our protocol analyzers following our acquisition of catc on october  the contribution to the total increase in revenue from protocol analyzers was approximately 
service and other revenues consist primarily of service revenue and license and maintenance fees 
service revenue increased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of the overall increase in demand for repair services 
in the third quarter of fiscal  based on our review and analysis of the then current classification of service kits  we made the decision to reclassify service kit revenue to product revenue from its historical classification 
for the years ended june  and  respectively  million and million of service kit revenue is included as product revenue 
service and other revenue in each of fiscal and also includes the recognition of million of revenue that was deferred with the adoption of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as of the beginning of fiscal foreign currency fluctuations contributed approximately million to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows year ended june  year ended june  in thousands north america   north america europe middle east   europe middle east japan   japan asia pacific   asia pacific total revenues   total revenues certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
these reclassifications had no impact on previously reported total revenues 
gross profit for the year ended june  was million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the increase in gross profit dollars is primarily attributable to increased volume of oscilloscopes shipped due to the introduction of the wavesurfer oscilloscope at the end of fiscal  the incremental profit from sales of protocol analyzers and favorable foreign exchange impact  partially offset by non cash charges of million for the write down of inventory related to the changes in our long term product support policy and product roadmap strategy  million for the write down of inventory  primarily related to a lower cost or market adjustment  as well as million for the write down of a technology license due to a change in our manufacturing strategy  which charges contributed to a lower gross margin for the year ended june  as a result of the amortization of acquired intangible assets  as well as the incremental cost of revenues related to the purchase accounting write up of acquired inventory to its fair value which offset the favorable impact from the sales of the higher margin protocol analyzers  the net impact on gross margin from sales of protocol analyzers for the year ended june  was immaterial 
we expect the sales of these products to have a more significant favorable effect on our overall gross margins in future periods 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense  including legal settlement expense of million increased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately of the increase in fiscal year reflects the incremental sg a expenses incurred as a result of the merger 
also included in sg a expense for the year ended june  is million of non cash amortization of deferred compensation related to our equity based long term incentive plan introduced at the end of fiscal the remaining increase in sg a was largely attributable to increases in certain legal and accounting expenses as well as less significant increases in other general spending categories 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense remained relatively flat in fiscal  compared with fiscal in fiscal  we expect selling  general and administrative expense will increase when compared to fiscal due to increased variable selling costs on higher forecasted revenues  increased non cash compensation expense associated with employee stock compensation under the newly implemented rules of sfas r  which require not only expense recognition of restricted stock compensation  as we are currently doing  but also  recognition of the fair value of employee stock purchase plans and the fair value of fixed award stock options  which previously were only reported on a pro forma basis  and the full year impact from the merger on selling  general and administrative expenses 
legal settlement expense for the year ended june  is related to the patent litigation settlement agreement reached with tektronix on may  research and development r d expense increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to incremental r d expenses incurred as a result of the merger 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting increased spending in anticipation of the launch of new products  and the impact of the merger including million of ipr d required to be expensed upon acquisition 
in fiscal  we intend to continue to invest a substantial percentage of our revenues into r d 
we periodically expect to introduce new products that address customer needs for solutions in a variety of market sectors 
we believe that our advanced hardware and software technologies incorporated into our core products can be adapted to address additional sectors of the large and diverse test and measurement market where we have not historically focused 
for example  early in fiscal  we plan to launch the industry s first protocol solution for wireless usb  providing us with a first mover advantage with this next generation protocol standard 
during the year we expect to introduce a real time oscilloscope with bandwidths much higher than any offering currently available  and a pci express generation protocol solution 
other expense income  net  which consists primarily of net interest income and expense and foreign exchange gains and losses  was an expense of approximately million for the year ended june   compared to an expense of  for fiscal other expense income  net for the current year comprised primarily interest expense of approximately million  compared to approximately million last year  which increase is due to the interest on the million term loan outstanding under our current credit agreement 
included in other  net were foreign exchange gains of approximately million and million for the year ended june  and  respectively  resulting from the changes in our foreign exchange forward contracts and on transactions denominated in other than our functional currency or that of our subsidiaries

a tax provision of million was recorded in fiscal  compared to a tax provision of million in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the net statutory tax rate for the year ended june  was  increased by a discrete nondeductible ipr d tax expense of  associated with the merger  and decreased by two discrete tax benefits aggregating  associated with the reversal of a prior year valuation allowance related to a favorable conclusion to a tax audit and a fiscal provision to return adjustment determined when we filed our fiscal tax returns 
on october   the american jobs creation act the act was signed into law 
the act includes a provision for the deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the act 
we have elected to apply this provision to certain repatriations of qualifying earnings in fiscal year we elected to repatriate million during the quarter ended december   pursuant to our approved domestic reinvestment plan 
the income tax effect recognized under the repatriation provision was approximately million which was substantially offset by the release of a tax reserve related to a favorable foreign tax audit settlement during the three months ended december  in fiscal  we recorded a million gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  net of income tax provisions  for the reversal of unused accrued discontinued operations reserves 
in fiscal  there were no such transactions 
on september   we repurchased all  issued and outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock from the holders thereof the holders for million the repurchase 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s position published in an emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d relating to induced conversions of preferred stock  we recorded the million premium paid to purchase the preferred stock as a charge to arrive at net income applicable to common stockholders in fiscal in fiscal  there were no such transactions 
lecroy and the holders agreed that the repurchase would be transacted as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we accounted for the repurchase as though no dividends had accrued in fiscal and that the unaccreted value attributed to the warrants at the point of issue was accelerated and combined with the redemption premium to reflect the total charge related to the repurchase in the consolidated statement of operations 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of  or million 
revenues from test and measurement products increased  or million  in fiscal this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in total oscilloscope units shipped due to increased customer demand and to higher average selling prices  the combined effect of which contributed million to the increase  and a million increase in sales of probes and accessories 
this increase in revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in sales of discontinued product lines  distributed products and components 
service and other revenues consist primarily of service revenue and license and maintenance fees 
service and other revenues decreased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we did not recognize any software license revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal when we recognized a million license of our proprietary maui instrument operating system technology 
in fiscal  based on management s review and analysis of the then current classification of service kits  we reclassified million and million in service kit revenue in fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  from service revenue to product revenue 
this reclassification has no effect on total revenues or results of operations and was made for these years in order to conform to fiscal presentation

additionally  included in gross profit in fiscal was the positive effect of the million in license revenues included in service and other revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily due to higher profits and higher average selling prices on our high performance wavemaster and mid performance waverunner oscilloscopes  lower manufacturing costs resulting from continued improvements in operational efficiency  positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenues while cost of revenues are predominately in us dollars  restructuring savings of million and the ongoing benefit of our shift to a direct sales model in china and singapore 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal includes million of severance charges and million of plant closing costs partially offset by the reversal of an unused restructuring reserve of million 
this increase was primarily due to increased variable selling costs related to higher revenues and the impact of foreign currencies  certain legal and compliance expenses and expenses related to performance bonuses that were suspended in the first three quarters of fiscal due to the weakness in the technology sector of the economy and in lecroy sales 
selling costs increased by million and general and administrative costs increased by million  net of restructuring savings of approximately million  partially offset by the decrease in net restructuring charges of million in fiscal compared to the same period in the prior year 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expense declined to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to our ability to leverage selling infrastructure over the increased revenues in fiscal research and development expense decreased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to cost savings realized from the consolidation of our probe development activities into our chestnut ridge  new york facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the full benefit of cost reduction initiatives taken in fiscal of approximately million  a million charge for severance in fiscal and the timing of certain project specific engineering expenses

net cash generated by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june   compared to net cash used of approximately million for the same period last year 
this increase in net cash generated by financing activities was primarily due to million of borrowings under the credit agreement used in connection with the merger net of issuance costs of million and the repayment of borrowings and capital lease obligations of million in the current fiscal year compared to the use of million in the comparable prior year period to repurchase our preferred stock 
on april   we closed an underwritten public follow on offering of  shares of our common stock at per share less the underwriting discount raising aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  net of million in offering costs and expenses

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
will apply to inventory costs beginning in fiscal year we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

the guidance in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be applied prospectively to nonmonetary asset exchange transactions in fiscal year we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this new pronouncement requires compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
 as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  sfas no 
permitted entities to continue to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
lecroy will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal year management is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of lecroy 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation to the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact on net income loss applicable to common stockholders and net income loss per share applicable to common stockholders from calculating stock related compensation cost under the fair value alternative of sfas no 
however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas no 
r may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under sfas no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas no 
which is effective for the company for reporting changes in accounting principles beginning fiscal year sfas no 
changes the reporting of a change in accounting principle to require retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless explicit transition provisions are provided for in new accounting pronouncements or existing pronouncements that are in the transition phase when sfas no 
becomes effective 
in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations 
this fsp addresses the accounting related to obligations associated with directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the directive adopted by the european union 
under the directive  the waste management obligation for historical equipment products put on the market on or prior to august  remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced 
this fsp is effective the later of the end of the first quarter of fiscal year or the date of adoption of the law by the applicable eu member country 
management is currently evaluating the impact of fsp forward looking information this form k contains forward looking statements 
when used in this form k  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  will  plan  intend  and expect and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
although we believe that our plans  intentions  and expectations reflected in any forward looking statements are reasonable  these plans  intentions  or expectations may not be achieved 
our actual results  performance  or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated  expressed  or implied  by the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are set forth in this form k  including under the heading risk factors 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth in this form k 
except as required by federal securities laws  we are under no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this form k when evaluating the company and its business 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment 
risks related to our business our operating results are expected to continue to fluctuate and may not meet our financial guidance or published analyst forecasts  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
our past operating results  including our gross profits  have fluctuated from fiscal period to fiscal period 
we expect our future operating results and gross profits will continue to fluctuate from fiscal period to fiscal period due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control and any of which could cause our stock price to fluctuate 
the primary factors that affect our operating results include the following o changes in overall demand for our products  o the timing of the announcement  introduction and market acceptance of new products by us or competing companies  o the timing and magnitude of research and development expenses  o changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rates of our markets  o changes in our production efficiency  o disruptions in operations at any of our facilities or the facilities of any of our contract manufacturers for any reason  o changes in the selling prices of our products  and o changes in foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  we have historically experienced somewhat lower activity during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  is due principally to the lower level of orders and market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
we believe this seasonal aspect of our business is likely to continue in the future 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above the price they paid 
the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
the stock price could fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o historically low trading volume in our stock relative to alternative investments  o announcements of developments related to our business  including additions or departures of key personnel  o announcements of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by us or our competitors  o sales by competitors  including sales to our customers  o sales of common stock into the public market  including those by directors and members of management  o developments in our relationships with our customers  partners  distributors and suppliers  o shortfalls or changes from analysts expectations in revenue  gross profits  earnings or losses  or other financial results  o regulatory developments  o fluctuations in results of operations  o failure to meet our financial obligations under any loans or financing agreements  o trends in the seasonality of our sales  and o general conditions in our market or the markets served by our customers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the market for shares of technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been due largely to factors other than the operating performance of the affected companies 
we cannot ensure that the market price of our common stock will not decline substantially  or otherwise continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our operating performance 
if demand for our products does not match manufacturing capacity  we may underutilize our capacity or  alternatively  be unable to fulfill orders in a timely manner  and in either situation our operating results may suffer 
the sale of our products is dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demands for their products 
we may not be able to adapt production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions in a timely manner 
when demand does not meet expectations  manufacturing capacity will likely exceed production requirements 
we have at times increased our production capacity and the overhead that supports production based on anticipated market demand which has not always developed as expected 
as a result  we have periodically underutilized our capacity  which has adversely affected our earnings due to existing fixed costs 
in addition  conversely  if during a market upturn we cannot increase manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will be unable to fulfill orders in a timely manner  which in turn may have a negative effect on operating results and our overall business 
if our operating results do not continue to improve in the long term  we may be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate whether our deferred tax assets can be realized and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
as of june   we had recorded million of net deferred tax assets related to the future tax benefit of certain expenses reported for financial statement purposes that have not yet been deducted on our tax returns 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
as of june   we had recorded a valuation allowance of  to reserve for those deferred tax assets we believe are not likely to be realized in future periods 
an additional valuation allowance would be recorded if it was deemed more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred assets will not be realized 
if we establish additional valuation allowances  we would record a tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we face risks from fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the us dollar and the cost of currency exchange  which affect our revenue  cost of revenue and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
a large portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  political instability  transportation delays and the imposition of tariffs and export controls 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect revenues  our cost of revenue and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
among the more significant potential risks to us of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the us dollar  european monetary unit  swiss franc  british pound  swedish krona  japanese yen  korean won  and singapore dollar 
we have a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
these foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting 
other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future as a result of mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 
no assurance can be given that our strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from having a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we face numerous risks associated with our international operations  which could cause a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations since approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived from international sales 
we market and sell our products and services outside the united states  and currently have employees located in china  france  germany  italy  japan  singapore  south korea  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
many of our customers and licensees are located outside the united states 
as part of our strategy  we have expanded our international sales  particularly in china 
we face numerous risks in doing business outside the united states  including o dependence on sales representatives or foreign distributors and their sales channels  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles  o less effective and less predictable recognition  protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights  specifically in areas of asia and particularly in china  o trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  o highly cyclical business environments  o unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements  o strengthening of the us dollar  which could make our products more expensive  o changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region  particularly in emerging markets  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
such factors could cause our future international sales to decline 
our business practices in international markets are also subject to the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act 
if any of our employees are found to have violated these requirements  we could be subject to significant fines and other penalties 
our products are also subject to united states export control restrictions 
in certain cases  we may not be permitted to export products without obtaining an export license 
us export laws also prohibit the export of our products to a number of countries deemed by the united states to be hostile 
the export of our high performance oscilloscopes from the united states  which accounts for a material portion of our internationally derived revenue  is also subject to regulation under the treaty for nuclear non proliferation 
however  only a small portion of those oscilloscopes are sold in countries where that treaty restricts the end user 
these restrictions may make foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products more competitive in the global market 
we cannot be certain that the us government will approve any pending or future export license requests 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised 
our international sales and  because approximately two thirds of our revenue is derived from sales outside the united states  our sales in general  could be materially harmed by our inability to obtain required licenses or by the costs of compliance 
we may be greatly impacted by the political  economic  and military conditions in china  taiwan  north korea  and south korea 
these countries have recently conducted military exercises in or near the others territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue or escalate  resulting in economic embargoes  disruptions in shipping  or even military hostilities 
this could severely harm our business by interrupting or delaying shipment of our products to or through these areas and or reducing our sales in these areas 
we depend on single source suppliers for some of our products  and the loss of these suppliers could harm our business by interrupting or terminating our manufacture of those products 
we purchase a small number of parts from single source suppliers 
in particular  several key integrated circuits that we use are made by international business machines ibm 
although we have not experienced significant production delays attributable to supply changes  we believe that  for integrated circuits in particular  alternative sources of supply would be difficult to develop over a short period of time 
because we have no direct control over our third party suppliers  interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these third parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion 
in addition  if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary parts or products  we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such parts or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers 
in such events  we could experience interruptions  delays  increased costs  or quality control problems 
we depend upon key personnel and qualified future hires to implement our expansion strategy  and if we are unable to retain or attract personnel we may not be able to manage and operate successfully and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives 
our success depends on the efforts and abilities of senior management and key employees in the sales  marketing  research and development  and manufacturing areas 
many of these employees would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with most of our key personnel 
if we cannot retain existing key managers and employ additional qualified senior employees  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our personnel 
future expansion of operations will require us to attract  train and retain new personnel 
in addition  we may be limited by non solicitation agreements entered into by our key personnel with respect to hiring employees from our competitors 
these factors could increase our operating expenses 
if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  or the costs of compensation or employee benefits increase substantially  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual and proprietary rights  which would deprive us of a competitive advantage and thereby negatively impact our ability to compete 
as a technology based company  our success depends on developing and protecting our intellectual property 
we rely generally on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and abroad 
electronic equipment as complex as most of our products  however  is generally not patentable in its entirety 
we also license intellectual property from third parties and rely on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
we cannot be certain that actions we take to establish and protect proprietary rights will be adequate  particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  or if we are unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it may be difficult to design alternatives to such technology without incurring significant costs 
thus  the loss of intellectual property rights to technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are engaged in intellectual property litigation 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or take action against others with regard to intellectual property rights 
even where we are successful in defending or pursuing such claims  we may incur significant costs 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay license fees for the infringed rights  either of which could have an adverse impact on our business 
we license certain intellectual property from third parties  and the loss of these licenses could delay development of future products or prevent the sale or enhancement of existing products 
we rely on licenses of intellectual property for our businesses  including technology used in our products 
we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 
the loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on acceptable terms could delay development of future products or prevent the further sale or enhancement of existing products 
such loss could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances and joint ventures 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of catc 
as a result of our acquisition of catc or other transactions which may be consummated  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of the newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including o the retention of key employees  o the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas  o the retention of key customers  and o the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities 
any impairment of the value of purchased assets or goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we may not be able to obtain the capital we need to maintain or grow our business 
our ability to execute our long term strategy may depend to a significant degree on our ability to obtain long term debt and equity capital 
we have no commitments for additional borrowings at this time  other than million remaining under the revolver with the bank of new york and the other lenders party thereto  or for sales of equity  other than under our existing employee benefit plans 
we cannot determine the precise amount and timing of our funding needs at this time 
we may be unable to obtain future additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we fail to comply with certain covenants relating to our indebtedness  we may need to refinance our indebtedness to repay it 
we also may need to refinance our indebtedness at maturity 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital on favorable terms to refinance our indebtedness 
the following factors could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all o our results of operations  o general economic conditions and conditions in our industry  o the perception in the capital markets of our business  o our ratio of debt to equity  o our financial condition  o our business prospects  and o changes in interest rates 
in addition  certain covenants relating to our million credit facility impose limitations on additional indebtedness 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future  we may have to curtail our capital expenditures and reduce research and development expenditures 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 
our operations and products are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 
we could incur substantial costs  including cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or noncompliance with environmental permits 
our former subsidiary  digitech industries  inc  has been involved in environmental remediation activities  the liability for which was retained by us and entirely reserved for after the sale of the vigilant networks segment and the residual assets of digitech 
any liability beyond what is currently expected and reserved for could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 
we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and  as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 
a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts  or administrative penalties 
beginning in july  we will be required to expense the fair value of stock options granted under our employee stock plans and our net income and earnings per share will be significantly reduced as a result 
in december  the fasb  issued sfas no 
revised entitled share based payment sfas r  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and no 
 requiring companies to expense the fair value of all employee equity based awards granted  modified or settled 
sfas r will be effective for us in our fiscal year commencing july and accordingly  will require any options and stock awards issued or vesting on or after that date and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan to be recognized as compensation expense 
currently  we record compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  for option grants that have an exercise price below fair value 
the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements from the calculation of compensation cost under apb no 
however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas r may be different from the calculation of pro forma compensation cost under sfas  but such differences have not yet been quantified 
we have a credit facility that contains financial covenants  and the failure to comply with these covenants could harm our financial condition because our credit facility may be unavailable to us 
we have a million credit facility with the bank of new york and the other lenders party thereto 
we are subject to financial covenants under our credit facility  including interest coverage ratio  minimum total net worth  leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash provided from operations  and borrowings pursuant to our credit facility will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service requirements 
failure to generate sufficient cash or comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility may adversely affect our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
issuance of shares in connection with financing transactions or under stock plans and outstanding warrants will dilute current stockholders 
pursuant to our stock plans  our management is authorized to grant restricted stock awards or stock options to our employees  directors and consultants 
in addition  we also have warrants outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock 
our stockholders will incur dilution upon exercise of any outstanding stock options or warrants 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock  or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock  further dilution to our existing stockholders will result  and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders 
anti takeover provisions under our stockholder rights plan  charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our stock 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company that our stockholders might consider favorable 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws allow us to o authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of the common stock  o provide for a classified board of directors  with each director serving a staggered three year term  o prohibit stockholders from filling board vacancies  calling special stockholder meetings  or taking action by written consent  and o require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporate law  which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
these and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then current board of directors  including delay or impede a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving our company 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we face burdens relating to the recent trend toward stricter corporate governance and financial reporting standards 
recently adopted or new legislation or regulations that follow the trend of imposing stricter corporate governance and financial reporting standards  including compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  have lead to an increase in our costs of compliance 
a failure to comply with these new laws and regulations may impact market perception of our financial condition and could materially harm our business 
additionally  it is unclear what additional laws or regulations may develop  and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes 
risks related to our industry we operate in highly competitive markets and this competition could reduce our market share and harm our business 
the oscilloscope and protocol analysis markets are highly competitive and characterized by rapid and continual advances in technology 
our principal competitors in these markets are tektronix and agilent 
both of our principal competitors have substantially greater sales and marketing  development and financial resources 
we believe that tektronix  agilent and other competitors each offer a wide range of products that attempt to address most sectors of the oscilloscope and many sectors of the protocol analysis markets 
we have historically engaged in intense competition with tektronix 
some of our senior managers  including our chief executive officer and chief operating officer  are former employees of tektronix 
in fiscal  we settled litigation with tektronix alleging that our oscilloscope products infringed certain patents held by tektronix by entering into a license agreement for the right to use that intellectual property 
in fiscal  we settled intellectual property litigation with tektronix in which both sides claimed patent infringement 
this settlement is described in more detail under item  legal proceedings  of part i of this form k 
we believe that the principal bases of competition in the oscilloscope and protocol analysis markets are a product s performance bandwidth  sample rate  memory length and processing power  its price and quality  the vendor s name recognition and reputation  product availability and the quality of post sale support 
if any of our competitors surpass us or are perceived to have surpassed us with respect to one or more of these factors  we may lose customers 
we also believe that our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain and develop the advanced technology used in our oscilloscope products and protocol analyzers and our ability to offer high performance products timely and at a favorable price to performance ratio 
we cannot assure that we will continue to compete effectively 
a prolonged economic downturn could materially harm our business by decreasing capital spending 
negative trends in the general economy  including trends resulting from actual or threatened military action by the united states and threats of terrorist attacks on the united states and abroad  could cause a decrease in capital spending in many of the markets we serve 
in particular  a downward cycle affecting the computer and semiconductor  data storage devices  automotive and industrial  and military and aerospace markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  if customers markets decline  we may not be able to collect outstanding amounts due to us 
such declines could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to maintain profitability 
we must successfully execute our strategy to introduce new products 
one of our key strategies is to expand our addressable portion of the oscilloscope and protocol analysis markets by introducing new products such as sampling oscilloscopes and protocol exercisers and probes 
we have in the past withdrawn a product line due to implementation concerns 
in august  we divested our vigilant networks  inc subsidiary because  while its technology was potentially viable  the additional capital investment required for its commercial success was judged to be too high 
the success of our new product offerings will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to identify customers existing and future needs properly and quickly  timely manufacture and deliver products that address these needs in sufficient volumes  differentiate offerings from competitors offerings  price products competitively and anticipate competitors development of new products or technological innovations 
without the timely introduction of competitive products  our products may become technologically obsolete 
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product announcements and introductions and changing industry standards 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  highly skilled engineering and development personnel and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
consequently  product development delays are typical in our industry 
if we fail to introduce competitive products timely  customers may defer placing orders in anticipation of future releases or purchase products from competitors 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including o changing product specifications and customer requirements  o unanticipated engineering complexities  o difficulties with or delays by contract manufacturers or suppliers of key components or technologies  o difficulties in allocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  and o difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products may become technologically obsolete  in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer 
if we devote resources to developing products for emerging communications standards that ultimately are not widely accepted  our business could be harmed 
our future growth depends  in part  upon our ability to develop  manufacture and sell in volume advanced verification systems for existing  emerging and yet unforeseen communications standards 
we have little or no control over the conception  development or adoption of new standards 
moreover  even in relation to currently emerging standards  the markets are rapidly evolving and we have virtually no ability to impact the adoption of those standards 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to whether markets for new and emerging standards ultimately will develop at all or  if they do develop  their potential size or future growth rate 
we may incur significant expenses and dedicate significant time and resources to develop products for standards that fail to gain broad acceptance 
failure of a standard for which we devote substantial resources to gain widespread acceptance would likely harm our business 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with the core or promoter companies in our target markets  we may have difficulty developing and marketing certain protocol analyzer products 
it is important to our success that we establish  maintain and expand our relationships with technology and infrastructure leader companies developing emerging communications standards in our target markets 
we must work closely with these companies to gain valuable insights into new market demands  obtain early access to standards as they develop and help us design new or enhanced products 
generally  we do not enter into contracts obligating these companies to work or share their technology 
industry leaders could choose to work with other companies in the future 
if we fail to establish  maintain and expand our industry relationships  we could lose first mover advantage with respect to emerging standards and it would likely be more difficult for us to develop and market products that address these standards 
we could be affected by government regulation and other legal uncertainties 
we manufacture our products in the united states  and sell our products and purchase parts  components and sub assemblies in a number of countries 
we are therefore subject to various significant international  federal  state and local regulations  including but not limited to health and safety  product content  labor and import export regulations 
for example  the export of high performance oscilloscopes from the united states is subject to regulation under the treaty for nuclear non proliferation 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  political instability  transportation delays and the imposition of tariffs and export controls 
among the more significant potential risks to us of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the us dollar  euro  swiss franc  british pound  swedish krona  japanese yen  korean won and singapore dollar 
we have a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
these foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities sfas no 

other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future as a result of mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations
