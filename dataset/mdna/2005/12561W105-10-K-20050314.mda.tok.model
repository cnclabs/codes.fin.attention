these purchases are made from the wholesale power market in the form of generation capacity and or energy 
portions of cleco power s capacity and power purchases through were made at fixed prices  and the remainder made approximately at prevailing market prices 
the following table sets forth the average cost and amounts of power purchased by cleco power on the wholesale market 
period cost per mwh thousand mwh percent of total energy requirements during  of cleco power s energy requirements were met with purchased power  up from in the primary factors causing the increase in power purchases in as compared to were the lower price of purchased power compared to the incremental cost of cleco power s generation of power  higher customer demand  and additional power requirements to fulfill energy management services contracts that commenced in may for information on cleco power s ability to pass on to its customers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power expenses  see regulatory matters  industry developments  and franchises rates 
during  cleco power obtained approximately of its annual capacity from power contracts with williams and dynegy 
these contracts expired on december  except for mw of capacity that expires in december under the contract with williams 
in addition  cleco s wholesale contract to purchase mw of capacity from the city of ruston expired in may in may  cleco power signed a one year contract to purchase mw of capacity from ces starting in january the contract was approved and certified by the lpsc in november this ces short term power contract will be primarily sourced from acadia  which is located in cleco power s control area  and is expected to minimize transmission risk 
cleco power also has a long term contract under which it purchases mw of power from the sabine river authority  which operates a hydroelectric generating plant 
in addition  cleco power has a wholesale power contract with the city of natchitoches for mw of capacity that expires in december management expects to meet its native load demand in with cleco power s own generation capacity and the contracts with williams and ces 
beyond  cleco power continues to evaluate longer term capacity requirements through its irp team as discussed below and a long term rfp issued in august a one year alternate solicitation for up to mw to meet requirements was issued in january the bids from this solicitation will be assessed both as separate alternatives to the long term rfp and in combination with the rfp 
cleco power expects the evaluation and selection timeline for the solicitation to parallel that of the rfp 
during  cleco power created an irp team to evaluate generation supply options 
irp is a process to evaluate resources in order to provide reliable and flexible generation services to electric customers at the lowest reasonable cost 
a full range of options is being analyzed including power purchases  fuel conversion  repowering projects  asset acquisitions  additional transmission infrastructure  cogeneration  plant retirements  and mothballing of existing assets 
the process considers operational and economical features  such as construction  operating and fuel costs  fuel diversity  reliability  ease of dispatch  environmental impact  and other factors of risk 
the irp team has developed a framework for evaluating proposed options to optimize service for cleco s customers needs and reduce and stabilize their fuel cost without sacrificing reliability 
any viable generation alternative must then be validated through an lpsc sanctioned solicitation rfp process 
for additional information on cleco power s rfps  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations cleco power significant factors affecting cleco power fuel and purchased power are primarily affected by the following factors 
because of its location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on one main supplier of electric transmission  and at times  constraints limit the amount of purchased power it can deliver into and or through its system 
the power contracts described above may be affected by these transmission constraints 
natural gas supply during  cleco power purchased a total of  mmbtu of natural gas for the generation of electricity 
the annual and average per day quantities of gas purchased by cleco power from each supplier are shown in the table below 
natural gas supplier purchases mmbtu average amount purchased per day mmbtu percent of total gas used crosstex lig bp energy cinergy marketing trading occidental energy marketing chevron texaco others total cleco power owns the natural gas pipelines and interconnections at its rodemacher and teche power stations 
this allows it to access various natural gas supply markets  which helps to maintain a more economical fuel supply for cleco power s customers 
natural gas was available without interruption throughout cleco power expects to continue to meet its natural gas requirements with purchases on the spot market through daily  monthly  and seasonal contracts with various natural gas suppliers 
however  future supplies to cleco power remain vulnerable to disruptions due to weather events and transportation delays 
large industrial users of natural gas  including electric utilities  generally have low priority among gas users in the event pipeline suppliers are forced to curtail deliveries due to inadequate supplies 
as a result  prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply interruptions 
currently  cleco power anticipates that its diverse supply options and alternative fuel capability  combined with its solid fuel generation resources  are adequate to meet its fuel needs during any temporary interruption of natural gas supplies 
coal and lignite supply cleco power uses coal for generation at rodemacher unit the majority of the coal for rodemacher unit is purchased from mines in wyoming from kennecott energy company kennecott 
in july  cleco power entered into a new two year agreement with kennecott that established fixed pricing through december   for the majority of cleco power s coal needs 
cleco power will purchase additional coal from other suppliers in coal is transported to rodemacher unit under a long term contract which expires in december terms for transporting coal beyond are currently under negotiation 
cleco power leases railcars to transport its coal under two long term leases 
one of the railcar leases expires in march and the other expires in march cleco power uses lignite for generation at the dolet hills power station 
substantially all of the lignite used to fuel dolet hills is obtained under two long term agreements 
cleco power and swepco  each a owner of dolet hills  have acquired an undivided interest in the other s leased and owned lignite reserves in northwestern louisiana 
in may  cleco power and swepco entered into a long term agreement with annual renewals through with dolet hills lignite company  llc dhlc  a wholly owned subsidiary of swepco  for the mining and delivery of such lignite reserves 
these reserves are expected to provide a substantial portion of the dolet hills unit s fuel requirements throughout the life of the contract with dhlc 
additionally  cleco power and swepco have entered into an agreement which expires in with red river mining company to purchase lignite 
cleco power s minimum annual purchase requirement of lignite under this agreement is  tons 
the lignite price under the contract is a base price per mmbtu  subject to escalation  plus certain pass through costs 
dhlc provides all of the lignite in excess of the  tons base commitment 
generally  the lignite price under the dhlc mining agreement equals the cost of production subject to certain adjustments 
for information regarding deferred mining costs and obligations associated with the dhlc mining agreement see  part ii
