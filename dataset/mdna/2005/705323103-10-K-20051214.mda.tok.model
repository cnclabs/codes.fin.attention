item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our products and services are designed to provide a high quality  lower cost alternative to prolonged hospitalization for medically fragile and chronically ill children 
we provide a broad range of pediatric healthcare services and equipment  including nursing  respiratory therapy and rental and sale of home medical equipment 
in addition  we provide rehabilitation and therapy services in our ppec day treatment centers for medically fragile and chronically ill children  well care services and special needs educational services for pediatric patients 
we also provide case management services in order to assist the family and patient by coordinating the provision of services between the insurer or other payor  the physician  the hospital and other healthcare providers 
as a complement to our pediatric respiratory services  we also provide respiratory and related services for adults 
industry overview we estimate that the us market for pediatric home healthcare exceeds billion 
the current market for pediatric home healthcare products and services is heavily fragmented  and is typically served by a large number of small entities that operate on a local or regional basis and typically provide a limited range of healthcare products and services 
this market is also served by a small number of national home healthcare companies that service the pediatric market as part of a broader product and service offering 
because of the high degree of specialization and the broad scope of products and services required for effective treatment of pediatric patients  we believe that there are significant growth opportunities for a national provider focused on the home based pediatric patients 
the pediatric home healthcare market is distinct in a number of respects 
pediatric patients tend to require a higher acuity of care due to their age and the severity of their medical conditions  and consequently they generally have a relatively long length of treatment  often measured in years rather than weeks or months 
pediatric illnesses and conditions include bronchopulmonary dysplasia  digestive and absorptive diseases  congenital heart defects and other cardiovascular disorders  cancer  cerebral palsy  obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease  orthopedic conditions and post surgical needs 
in many instances  pediatric patients have multiple disorders 
home care for pediatric patients  like home care generally  is often preferred over institutional care by patients and their parents or other care givers  as well as by payors 
patients and parents prefer home care due to the ability to care for the child in a nurturing environment with family involvement 
home care also minimizes the risk of cross infection  eliminates privacy and safety concerns and permits a more gradual and consequently more event free transition of care giving from the healthcare professional to the family 
payors prefer home care because it is typically more cost effective than institutional care 
third party reimbursement for pediatric home healthcare is provided by private health insurance and governmental payors  primarily state medicaid programs 
because of the special needs of pediatric patients  the acuity of care and the skill levels of the individual nurses or therapists providing the care  the rates charged for pediatric healthcare services  particularly pediatric nursing services  are generally higher than adult rates 
in addition  due to the high medical acuity of pediatric patients and the large variations in patient conditions and treatment protocols  pediatric home healthcare is typically not reimbursed on a capitated basis 

table of contents unlike geriatric home care patients  who typically receive maintenance care  pediatric home care patients are often treated interventionally  using technologically advanced medical equipment such as ventilators  oxygen delivery systems  feeding pumps  nebulizers  sleep apnea monitors and other respiratory equipment 
due to the specialized care required to treat pediatric illnesses and conditions  home nursing care is most effectively delivered to pediatric patients by nurses with experience in neonatal intensive care unit nicu  pediatric intensive care unit picu or equivalent experience 
these specialized healthcare professionals are experienced in treating medically fragile children and administering required medications and other therapies 
pediatric patients typically require home nursing in shifts  in which nursing care is delivered eight to twenty four hours per day  in contrast to home nursing care for geriatric patients  in which nursing care is typically provided on a short duration visiting nurse basis 
like pediatric patients  young adult home care patients  who range in age from to years  often require long term care from private duty nurses 
young adult patients suffer from such disorders as muscular dystrophy  cardiovascular disorders and cancer 
many young adult patients suffer injury and significant disabilities from accidents or other forms of trauma 
many of these disorders and illnesses require lifelong treatment 
frequently  a young adult patient receives home care as a continuation of a pediatric home care treatment regimen 
a large percentage of young adult patients are covered by private health insurance  with the remainder covered by medicaid 
geriatric patients those patients age years old and older generally have shorter periods of service and shorter periods of daily care 
many geriatric patients suffer from emphysema or other pulmonary disorders requiring oxygen therapy on a continuous basis 
geriatric patients with more acute conditions are more likely to receive care in an institutional setting 
most geriatric patients are covered by medicare for all or part of their healthcare needs 
competition the markets for our healthcare services are highly competitive and are divided among a large number of providers  some of which are national providers  but most of which are either regional or local providers 
in addition to competing with other home healthcare companies focusing on providing products and services to pediatric patients  we compete with several large national home healthcare companies that  while not focusing primarily on the pediatric patient  provide pediatric home healthcare services as part of a broader service offering 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we have and may  in certain locations  possess licenses or certificates that permit them to provide services that we cannot currently provide 
in addition to our traditional competitors  other types of healthcare providers  including hospitals  physician groups and other home health agencies  have entered  and may continue to enter  our business 
among the barriers to entry that may exist in the home health industry are the requirements to acquire certificates of need  respiratory licenses  clinical accreditations  managed care contracts  clinical reputation  established local market relationships with physicians and discharge planners  pediatric trained nurses  and patient referrals 
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to maintain or increase our business and adversely affect our operating results 
business strategy we provide a high quality  lower cost alternative to prolonged hospitalization for medically fragile and chronically ill children in need of private duty nursing pdn  prescribed pediatric extended care ppec or respiratory therapy equipment and services rtes 
in addition  we provide rtes for adults in select markets 
we obtain patient referrals primarily based on quality of care and service  reputation with referring healthcare 
table of contents professionals  ability to develop and maintain contacts with referral sources and price of services 
we believe that our specialization in pediatric home healthcare  as well as our coordinated care approach to home healthcare services  broadens our appeal to local healthcare professionals and to managed care organizations 
we believe executing the following strategies will allow us to be the provider of choice in the markets we serve 
strategic review 
during fiscal year  we undertook a comprehensive strategic review of the business which culminated in the decision to sell selected assets of the pharmacy business see item 
with the proceeds from this sale  we intend to aggressively pursue an acquisition and start up strategy of pediatric private duty nursing businesses 
as we seek to increase our market density  our focus will be on those states that place the highest value on our services  particularly those where we already have a presence 
focus on pediatric services 
pediatric healthcare services are generally recognized as a distinct specialty within the healthcare industry 
we have significant experience and expertise in children s healthcare  particularly with respect to medically fragile children and chronically ill infants and children who are dependent on sophisticated medical technology and nursing care 
we believe that our pediatric focus and expertise differentiates us from other providers in that we are able to address a wide array of disease states and conditions 
this capability appeals to state medicaid programs focused on serving target populations as well as national managed care providers with diverse geographical needs 
demonstration of these improved clinical outcomes is the basis for the pediatric premium we attempt to negotiate into our pricing and future expansion of our care continuum from patient discharge through private duty nursing and ppec services  where available 
provide high quality  cost effective care 
we emphasize quality throughout our organization with respect to the provision of services and the hiring and training of clinical personnel 
moreover  we believe that our ability to coordinate and deliver a wide range of services within our core competencies in a non institutional setting  and our experience and expertise in caring for medically fragile and chronically ill infants and children  result in superior and cost effective medical outcomes 
build density in core states 
through a focused and aggressive acquisitions program  coupled with selective start ups  we intend to build private duty nursing density in those states that attach the greatest value for our services 
we believe that this will enable us to achieve the degree of market share necessary to leverage our capabilities and impact payors and referral sources to maximize our profit and growth potential 
improve internal operating efficiencies in rtes segment 
while supporting our pediatric mission  we intend to grow the adult  high tech respiratory segment of our business 
development of a web based management tool  which automates administration from patient intake through delivery of the products and services  coupled with increased efficiencies within existing locations  should drive improved profitability 
increased managed care penetration 
we continue to pursue a managed care marketing strategy which focuses on select markets with unfulfilled market share potential 
our regional managed care sales personnel work directly with location directors to increase local market share 
initiatives include identification of the dominant local market managed care companies and their provider networks  coordination of marketing and contracting efforts  development and expansion of relationships with key referral sources  evaluation and qualification of patient intakes  and effective coordination with local market medicaid programs 
clinical outcomes 
we believe that our ability to quantify the efficacy of the clinical outcomes of our patients will be increasingly important to our ability to negotiate a pediatric premium into our future pricing 
as such  during fiscal year  we accelerated development of a data collection and analysis tool to enhance our ability to measure and communicate these results to our key medicaid programs and managed care payors 
at this point in time we have begun to pilot data collection and reporting methodologies in select markets 

table of contents funding of these initiatives will be prioritized using our sources of liquidity articulated under the liquidity and capital resources sub section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
products  services and operations products and services we provide a broad range of healthcare services and products principally for children and  to a lesser extent  young adults and geriatric patients 
we define pediatric as age eighteen and younger with the remainder defined as adult 
patients who began service with us as children and are still on service upon attaining the age of eighteen are classified as adults 
the following table summarizes both products and services from continuing operations based upon estimated percentages of net billings of each major category for the periods indicated 
total total total pediatric home health care nursing ppec respiratory therapy equipment and services total pediatric home health care adult home health care nursing respiratory therapy equipment and services total adult home health care total pediatric healthcare services pediatric nursing services 
our pediatric nursing services consist primarily of private duty home nursing care for pediatric patients with illnesses and conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia  digestive and absorptive diseases  congenital heart defects and other cardiovascular disorders  cancer  cerebral palsy  obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease eg  bronchitis and asthma  orthopedic conditions and post surgical needs 
pediatric home nursing care typically begins upon the patient s discharge from the hospital 
under a prescription or care plan developed by the patient s physician  our nurses and therapists monitor the condition of the child  administer medications and treatment regimens  provide enteral and other forms of tube feeding  monitor and maintain ventilators  oxygen and other home medical equipment  monitor and administer pain management  provide daily care  including baths  hygiene and skin care  conduct physical and other forms of prescribed therapy  and coordinate other forms of medical care necessary for the child 
home nursing care is often provided up to hours per day for extended periods of time 
we estimate that our pediatric patients require private duty nursing care for an average of eight months with length of daily care averaging approximately ten hours 
our nurses emphasize education of the caregivers of the child to maximize the independence of the child and the family 
through this educational process  the length of daily private duty care can be modified as the child s condition improves or stabilizes and the parents or caregivers assume a more active role in the care of the child 
depending on the condition of the child and the orders of the attending physician  we may continue to provide nursing visits  respiratory therapy and other medical equipment after we discontinue private duty nursing care 
we have approximately  registered or licensed pediatric nurses on our active nursing registries 
due to the special needs and acuity of care of pediatric patients generally  we require that our nurses have training with pediatric patients 
most of our nurses have expanded pediatric experience  such as nicu  picu or equivalent experience 

table of contents prior to the discharge of a medically fragile child from the hospital  referral sources generally make arrangements for nursing services before making arrangements for other healthcare services such as equipment 
consequently  a high quality and well trained nursing service can help market our other pediatric product lines and services based on patient needs 
prescribed pediatric extended care ppec 
our ppec centers provide  among other services  daily medical care and physical  occupational and other forms of therapy for medically fragile and chronically ill children 
the children receive nursing supervision and or physical  occupational and other therapies in a setting that allows for socialization and education of the children 
the children generally spend between to hours per week at the center according to their individual plan of treatment 
we currently operate nine ppec centers in florida  georgia and north carolina 
pediatric respiratory therapy  equipment and services rtes 
we provide respiratory therapy equipment and services to pediatric patients in the home 
the services include i the rental  sale  delivery and setup  in accordance with physician prescriptions or orders of equipment such as ventilators  oxygen concentrators  liquid oxygen systems  high pressure oxygen cylinders  apnea monitors and nebulizers  ii periodic evaluation and maintenance of the equipment and iii delivery and setup of disposable supplies necessary for the operation of the equipment 
our branch offices provide rental of home medical equipment as well as mail order programs for the provision of a broad range of home healthcare supplies 
we provide these services to patients with a variety of conditions  including obstructive and restrictive pulmonary diseases  neurologically related respiratory problems  congenital heart defects and cancer 
we utilize skilled registered respiratory therapists  certified respiratory therapy technicians  and other qualified health professionals to provide these services 
we also provide training to patients and their families in equipment use and service as well as emergency on call support 
in addition  we provide rental  sale and service of home medical equipment and respiratory therapy services to adult and pediatric patients with a focus on high tech products including ventilators  oxygen concentrators  liquid oxygen systems  continuous positive airway pressure devices cpap  bi level respiratory assist devices bipap  and oximetry and apnea monitors 
these services are provided to patients upon their discharge from the hospital  as well as after our nursing services are no longer required 
young adult and geriatric respiratory therapy and equipment services we generally offer young adult patients healthcare equipment services similar to those provided to pediatric patients 
our young adult patients are generally treated for disorders such as muscular dystrophy  cystic fibrosis  cardiovascular disorders and cancer  as well as serious disabilities from accidents and other forms of trauma involving spinal cord or other injuries 
few of these patients require private duty nursing services 
frequently  our young adult patients receive home care as a continuation of a pediatric home care treatment regimen 
our geriatric home care patients generally require the lowest acuity of care and have shorter periods of service and shorter periods of daily care than either our pediatric or young adult patients 
few of these patients receive private duty nursing services 
most of these patients receive maintenance care for end of life conditions such as emphysema or other pulmonary disorders  cardiac diseases and renal diseases 
services are provided during short home visits by respiratory therapists or technicians 
although some of our geriatric home care patients receive higher acuity intervention care  these services are more likely to be provided in an institutional setting 
we also operate a mail order medication service that provides physician prescribed unit dose medications to respiratory therapy patients 
we offer our patients medication in a premixed unit dose form as well as professional clinical support and claims processing 
we employ licensed pharmacists to assist with our unit dose medication services business 

table of contents operations recruiting  training and retention of professional staff our pediatric services are generally provided by skilled pediatric nurses and skilled respiratory therapists 
nurses typically have pediatric  nicu  picu or equivalent experience  a nursing license and current cpr certification 
each nurse must pass a written pediatric competency and medication exam  provide employment references and submit to a comprehensive multi jurisdictional background check 
therapists generally have a minimum of one year prior experience and current cpr certification  and must provide employment references as well 
under our pediatric nursing training program  nurses are required to attend an orientation program where they are trained in aspects of home healthcare  such as equipment use  that differ from institutionally provided healthcare 
if qualified  nurses receive additional training in the use of ventilators and other home respiratory equipment 
we require our nurses to attend continuing education sessions on safety and techniques in home healthcare 
further  to assist in the retention of qualified personnel  we offer our nurses periodic continuing education courses and professional seminars on various topics in home healthcare 
as of september   we had approximately  licensed or credentialed nurses  therapists  and pharmacists on our staff and active registries 
to provide a qualified  reliable nursing and therapy services staff  we continuously recruit registered nurses  licensed practical nurses  respiratory therapists  licensed pharmacists  home health aides and technical specialists  and offer training and other programs to encourage retention of these professionals 
we recruit primarily through internet websites  advertising  employment fairs  direct mail and employee referral programs that use rewards and other benefit programs to encourage new employee referrals by existing employees 
the healthcare industry in total and the home health industry more acutely  have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting qualified nurses due primarily to lack of enrollment in nurse training programs and alternate career opportunities for experienced nurses 
as a result  we have ten nurse recruiting specialists on staff that direct local nurse recruiting efforts to maximize their effectiveness and potentially increase the number of hours staffed 
furthermore  current indications suggest that the supply of licensed qualified nurses will continue to decline in the foreseeable future 
quality assurance we have an established quality assurance program for the implementation and monitoring of service standards 
our quality assurance program includes audits  surveys  assessments and evaluations as well as other measures designed to ensure compliance with the documentation and operating procedures required by federal  state and local law  as well as our internal standards 
our compliance officer oversees the results of these quality assurance audits and implements changes where necessary 
we and all of our branch offices are fully accredited by the community health accreditation program or chap 
chap is a national leader in the accreditation of community based organizations  has a keen understanding of the home health industry and is a recognized accreditation body by payors 
chap is an independent subsidiary of the national league for nursing 
case administration prior to providing services to a patient  we coordinate with the patient s physicians  third party payors  case managers and other referral sources 
to provide better quality services to select high acuity patients  we have developed and implemented case management and clinical coordination functions 
case management 
we employ case managers to ensure the cost effective delivery of high quality care to many of our highest acuity patients covered by commercial insurance 
we assign a case manager to review the patient s insurance status to determine coverage and relevant reimbursement criteria 
the case manager contacts the relevant third party payors to negotiate the services that will be covered and the applicable rates 
the case manager then communicates with our billing and collection department to assist in accurate billing 
the case manager also assists in resolving disputes that may arise between us and third party payors 

table of contents clinical coordination 
we assign a clinical coordinator to higher acuity patients  typically before the patient is discharged from the hospital 
the clinical coordinator works with the physician  case manager or other referral source to arrange all home healthcare services needed by the patient 
sales and marketing we obtain patient referrals primarily from case managers  neonatologists  pediatricians  pulmonologists  internists and other physicians  hospital discharge planners  community based healthcare institutions and social service agencies 
we market our services to these referral sources through our managed care marketing personnel  sales and marketing personnel  branch office personnel and various media formats 
the branch office directors coordinate the various sales and marketing activities at the branch office level 
branch office directors generally have a clinical background as registered nurses and or therapists and  as such  they are able to describe and promote our services to referral sources 
the branch office directors attempt to cultivate relationships with their local referral sources through quality service  personal contacts and education about the appropriate role and benefits of our services in the treatment of patients 
we also promote referrals by seeking to arrange preferred provider contracts with managed care companies 
we have established preferred provider arrangements that are both national and regional in scope 
the contracts typically designate us as a preferred provider of certain services in select areas but do not establish an exclusive relationship 
the preferred provider contracts typically set forth a range of services that we may provide and the applicable rates for such services 
the contracts also specify required billing and claims procedures  record maintenance policies and other requirements 
we have not entered into any contracts with health maintenance organizations or other third party payors that require services to be rendered on a risk sharing or capitated basis 
we believe that chap accreditation of our offices is an important factor in our sales and marketing efforts 
we also believe that our focus on pediatric healthcare services  combined with management s experience in rendering these services  provide us with a significant sales and marketing advantage 
billing and collection we derive substantially all of our net revenue from commercial third party and selected private payors  medicare and medicaid 
the current reimbursement environment is complex  involving multiple payors with differing coverage and reimbursement policies 
management of accounts receivable  through effective billing  collection and reimbursement procedures  is critical to the financial success of healthcare service providers due to lengthy reimbursement periods 
any significant delay in reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our corporate reimbursement specialists work closely with the branch offices and the payors 
each specialist is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the documentation  submitting the documentation and claims to third party payors and expediting payment 
branch office network we currently provide our healthcare services through a network of over branch offices  including satellite offices and new branch offices  located in states 
we seek to address local market needs through our branch office network 
each branch office conducts local marketing efforts  recruits personnel and coordinates patient care 
we believe that the business of providing healthcare services is local in nature and is most effective if each branch office is proactive in meeting the needs of the local community 
while allowing our branch office managers sufficient autonomy to address local needs  we provide our branch office managers support and direction from the corporate office including  training  comprehensive policies and procedures  standardized operating systems and related controls 
in addition  our local market staff routinely collaborates with the appropriate community and regulatory authorities on our behalf and that of our patients 
for financial reporting purposes  our branch offices are aggregated into three reportable segments based on their predominant line of net revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 

table of contents corporate compliance program our corporate compliance program continues to focus its efforts in the areas of fraud and abuse  auditing and monitoring of regulatory compliance  training of our employees and providing support and guidance for employees as they strive to comply with the rules  regulations and policies governing or applying to us and our operations 
the compliance officer reports directly to the chairman of the audit committee of our board of directors 
the compliance department has conducted audits in the areas of billing  payroll  and medical documentation at selected branch offices throughout our company 
the compliance department has been active in establishing several training programs relating to proper documentation  and has provided in service training regarding corporate compliance to substantially all employees 
the compliance department has also been instrumental in the development and implementation of our compliance efforts at the branch office level 
in addition  we have established a toll free compliance hotline to assist in our commitment to ethical conduct throughout our company 
the telephone number is all employees  vendors  contractors and agents are encouraged to use this confidential means of communication to report any compliance issues 
investor relations we maintain an investor relations department that seeks to facilitate effective communication between us and our shareholders within the limitations of applicable regulations 
we also engage an outside investor relations firm to assist in raising our visibility to the investing public  including institutional investors and brokerage firms 
the investor relations department is also charged with the implementation and administration of our corporate governance guidelines as they relate to the investing public 
management information systems our business depends in part upon our ability to input  store  retrieve  process and manage billing and collection information for each patient 
our internally developed encore system provides substantially all of our locations with immediate access to patient  contract  and payor information and supports substantially all necessary billing  cash posting  and collection services 
we continue to make improvements in billing functionality to comply with payor contract requirements 
we plan to continue extending electronic billing and funds transfer capabilities to more payors 
we continue to invest in upgrades to our technical infrastructure to maximize information system reliability  data integrity and disaster recoverability 
there can be no assurance that our information systems will continue to perform as expected  or that further development will not be required 
failure of our management information systems to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
internal audit we maintain an internal audit function that reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the primary role of the internal audit function is to execute the branch office audit program  designed and approved by the audit committee 
ongoing risk assessments are performed to indicate which branch offices are to be selected for transaction and process control tests 
branch office audits may be performed by a combination of employees and outside consultants 
reimbursement we focus our healthcare marketing efforts on patients with private insurance and governmental payors 
due to the nature of our business  many of our patients rely on medicare and medicaid for health coverage 

table of contents the following are the estimated percentages of our net revenue from continuing operations attributable to reimbursement from various payors for the healthcare services we currently provide  for the periods presented year ended september  payor commercial insurance and other private payors medicaid and other state programs medicare and other federal programs total during the past decade  federal and state governments and private payors have taken extensive steps intended to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare 
these steps have included  among others  reduced reimbursement rates  changes in and reduction of services covered  increased prospective  concurrent and retrospective utilization review of services  negotiated prospective or discounted contract pricing and adoption of a competitive bid approach to service contracts 
cost containment efforts are expected to continue in the future 
home healthcare  which is usually less costly than hospital based care  generally has benefited from certain of these cost containment efforts 
as expenditures on home healthcare services have grown  however  initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of healthcare delivery in non institutional settings have increased 
many state medicaid programs  in an effort to contain the cost of healthcare and in light of state budgetary constraints  have reduced their payment rates and have narrowed the scope of covered services 
likewise  the federal government  through legislation and regulation  has acted repeatedly to limit expenditures for healthcare  including home health services  respiratory and home medical equipment 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a significant change in coverage or a reduction in payment rates for the types of services we provide could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
laws and regulations general 
our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing state and federal regulation 
state laws regulate several aspects of our business  including home health  durable medical equipment dme  and oxygen services including certificates of need and licensure requirements in certain states 
we also are subject to certain state laws prohibiting the payment of remuneration for patient or business referrals and the provision of services where a financial relationship exists between a referring person or entity and the entity providing the service 
federal laws governing our activities include regulation under the medicare and medicaid programs relating to  among other things  certification of home health agencies and reimbursement 
federal fraud and abuse laws prohibit or restrict  among other things  the payment of remuneration to parties in a position to influence or cause the referral of patients or business  as well as the filing of false claims 
changes in or new interpretations of these laws could have an adverse effect on our methods and costs of doing business 
further  failure by us to comply with such laws could adversely affect our ability to continue to provide  or receive reimbursement for  our equipment and services  and also could subject the company and our officers and employees to civil and criminal penalties 
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter regulatory impediments that could adversely affect our ability to open new branch offices or to expand the services currently provided by our existing branch offices 
medicare and medicaid regulations 
as a provider of services under the medicare and medicaid programs the programs  we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing reimbursement procedures and practices 
these laws include the medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse statutes and regulations which  among other provisions  prohibit the payment or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring business or patients to providers for which payments are made by a governmental healthcare program 
violation of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  including substantial fines  loss of the right to participate in the programs and imprisonment of responsible individuals 
in addition  the health insurance 
table of contents portability and accountability act of hipaa expanded the government s fraud and abuse enforcement powers 
among other provisions  hipaa expands the government s authority to prosecute fraud and abuse beyond medicare and medicaid to all payors  makes exclusion from the programs mandatory for a minimum of five years for any felony conviction relating to fraud  requires that organizations contracting with another organization or individual take steps to be informed as to whether the organization or individual is excluded from medicare and medicaid participation  and enhances civil penalties by increasing the amount of fines permitted 
these laws also include a prohibition on referrals contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of stark i  which prohibits referrals by physicians to clinical laboratories where the physician has a financial interest  and further prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of stark ii  which prohibits such referrals for a more extensive range of services  including home health and durable medical equipment 
various federal and state laws impose civil and criminal penalties against participants in the programs who make false claims for payment for services or otherwise engage in false billing practices 
many state laws prohibit the payment or receipt or the offer of anything of value in return for  or to induce  a referral for healthcare goods or services 
in addition  there are several other statutes that  although they do not explicitly address payments for referrals  could be interpreted as prohibiting the practice 
while similar in many respects to the federal laws  these state laws vary from state to state  are often vague and have sometimes been interpreted inconsistently by courts and regulatory agencies 
private insurers and various state enforcement agencies have also increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers practices and claims  particularly in the home health and home medical equipment sectors 
in recent years  enforcement of federal fraud and abuse laws  as well as regulatory scrutiny in general  has increasingly focused on the home healthcare industry 
for example  the government has implemented operation restore trust  a federal investigative initiative focused on home health  home medical equipment and skilled nursing facility providers 
operation restore trust is now operational in every state  and millions of dollars in funds fraudulently obtained by providers have been recovered 
the government also has implemented wedge audits  which involve a review of a small sample of patient records to identify non compliance and project an error rate for all claims in a discrete period 
periodic and random audits by intermediaries or by state medicaid agencies may result in delays in receipt or adjustments to the amounts of reimbursement received under the medicare  medicaid or medicaid waiver programs 
there can be no assurance that we will not become the subject of a regulatory or other investigation or proceeding or that our interpretations of applicable healthcare laws and regulations will not be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost to us  diversion of management s time and attention  and could have a materially adverse effect on our company 
for a discussion of the impact of recent changes to medicare and medicaid regulations please refer to recent developments under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results and operations 
regulation of certain transactions 
the social security act  as amended by hipaa  provides for the mandatory exclusion of providers and related persons from participation in the programs if the individual or entity has been convicted of a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under the programs or relating to neglect or abuse of patients 
further  individuals or entities may be  but are not required to be  excluded from the programs in circumstances including  but not limited to  convictions relating to fraud  obstruction of an investigation of a controlled substance  license revocation or suspension  filing claims for excessive charges or unnecessary services or failure to furnish medically necessary services  or ownership or control by an individual who has been excluded from the programs  against whom a civil monetary penalty related to the programs has been assessed  or who has been convicted of a crime described in this section 
the illegal remuneration provisions of the social security act make it a felony to solicit  receive  offer to pay  or pay any kickback  bribe  or rebate in return for referring a patient for any item or service  or in return for purchasing  leasing or ordering any good  service or item  for which payment may be made under the programs 
other 
table of contents provisions in hipaa proscribe false statements in billing and in meeting reporting requirements and in representations made with respect to the conditions or operations of providers 
a violation of the illegal remuneration statute is a felony and may result in the imposition of criminal penalties  including imprisonment for up to five years and or a fine of up to  further  a civil action to exclude a provider from participation in the programs could occur 
there are also other civil and criminal statutes applicable to the industry  such as those governing false billings and the new healthcare services offenses contained in hipaa  including healthcare services fraud  theft or embezzlement  false statements and obstruction of criminal investigation of offenses 
the first criminal conviction and sentencing for a violation of the hipaa privacy rules occurred in november criminal sanctions for these new healthcare criminal offenses can be severe  including imprisonment for up to twenty years 
legal compliance 
we maintain a compliance program designed to minimize the likelihood that we would engage in conduct or enter into contracts in violation of the fraud and abuse laws 
contracts of the types subject to these laws are reviewed and approved by the managed care and or legal departments 
we also maintain various educational programs designed to keep our managers updated and informed on developments with respect to the fraud and abuse laws and to remind all employees of our policy of strict compliance in this area 
we have established a toll free compliance hotline to assist in our commitment to ethical conduct throughout our company 
while we believe our operations comply with applicable laws and regulations  we cannot provide any assurance that further administrative or judicial interpretations of existing laws or legislative enactment of new laws will not have a materially adverse effect on our business 
medicare certification 
federal regulations governing the medicare program are also applicable to our company 
regulations for medicare reimbursement include an annual review of healthcare operations and personnel and provide criteria for coverage and reimbursement 
we are medicare certified to provide nursing services in thirteen states  as required 
permits and licensure 
many states require licensure of companies providing home healthcare services and other products and services of the type offered by our company 
we are currently licensed as a home health agency in twelve states and a home care agency in five states 
we also provide unit dose medications by mail order to various states 
certificates of need 
a number of states require companies providing home healthcare services and other services of the type offered by us to have a certificate of need issued by the state s health planning agency 
certificates of need are often difficult to obtain and in many instances are not obtainable at all because an area is determined to be adequately served by existing providers or for other reasons 
if we commence operations in a state  or expand our operations in a state where we are currently operating  and those operations require a certificate of need  we will be required to obtain such certificates of need with respect to those operations 
we currently have certificates of need in four states 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain other required certificates of need and  if so required  we will incur expenses in connection with attempting to obtain such certificates of need 
hipaa 
hipaa s administrative simplification rules mandate that healthcare providers who conduct standard transactions electronically  payors and clearinghouses  enact measures to protect personally identifiable health information the privacy rules  use standard electronic transaction and code sets the standard transactions rules and ensure the security of health information in electronic form the security rules 
multiple sets of regulations  each with its own compliance date  have been issued to implement the different administrative simplification requirements 
the compliance dates for the privacy rules  the standard transactions rules and the security rules have already been reached 
we were materially compliant by such dates 
the full effect of hipaa s rules is not yet known  in part because further amendment of the regulations is likely 
we have appointed a privacy officer and a security officer  and have established and followed a timeline 
table of contents for full implementation of the rules by the mandated compliance deadlines 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that these and other changes will not materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
environmental matters medical facilities are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations  such as air and water quality control requirements  waste management requirements and requirements for training employees in the proper handling and management of hazardous materials and wastes 
our typical branch office facility operations include  but are not limited to  the handling  use  storage  transportation  disposal and or discharge of hazardous  toxic  infectious  flammable and other hazardous materials  waste  pollutants or contaminants 
these activities may result in injury to individuals or damage to property or the environment and may result in legal liability damages  injunctions  fines  penalties or other governmental agency actions 
we are not aware of any pending or threatened claim  investigation or enforcement action regarding environmental issues  which  if determined adversely to us  would have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect our company in the future 
if any of the risks discussed below actually occur  our business  financial condition  operating results  or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to our business changes in reimbursement rates or policies  including legislative and regulatory actions  may have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 
the profitability of our business depends on payment and reimbursement from governmental and non governmental third party payors 
federal and state governments as well as commercial third party and selected private payors have taken and continue to take extensive steps intended to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare 
these steps have included  among others  reductions in reimbursement rates  changes in services covered  increased utilization review of services  negotiated prospective or discounted contract pricing  and adoption of a competitive bid approach to service contracts 
cost containment efforts are expected to continue in the future 
we cannot assure you that payments under state or federal governmental programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs 
although home healthcare  which is generally less costly than hospital based care  has benefited from many of these cost containment efforts  as expenditures in the home healthcare market continue to grow  governmental and private payor initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of healthcare delivery at non hospital sites are increasing 
many state medicaid programs  in an effort to contain the cost of healthcare and in light of state budgetary constraints  have reduced their payment rates and have narrowed the scope of covered services 
initiatives have been implemented in the past and such initiatives are expected to continue in the future 
there can be no assurance that these initiatives will not materially and adversely affect our revenues from these sources and  consequently  our results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the services that we provide and the facilities that we operate will meet or continue to meet the requirements for participation in these programs 
our business may suffer if we lose relationships with payors 
we are highly dependent on reimbursement from non governmental payors 
from time to time  payors with whom we have relationships require that we and our competitors bid to keep their business  and there can be no assurance that we will be retained or that our margins will not be adversely affected when that happens 
the loss of a payor relationship or an adverse change in the financial condition of a payor could result in the loss of a significant number of patients and or the write off of accounts receivables  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of and its related regulations may reduce amounts reimbursable for our products 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
federal and state laws that protect the privacy of patient health information  such as hipaa  may increase our costs  result in delays in reimbursement and limit our ability to collect and use that information 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to collect reimbursements for our products and services from third party payors in a timely manner 
we are responsible for submitting reimbursement requests to third party payors and collecting the reimbursements  and assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed reimbursements 
in the current healthcare environment  we may experience difficulties in collecting reimbursements because third party payors may seek to reduce  by appeal or otherwise  or delay reimbursements to which we are entitled for products and services that we have provided 
our business may be affected by delays in reimbursement from when we provide products and services to when we receive the reimbursement or payment for these products and services 
this timing delay may cause working capital shortages from time to time 
as a result  working capital management  including prompt and diligent billing and collection  is an important factor in our results of operation and liquidity 
we cannot assure you that trends in the industry will not further extend the collection period and adversely impact our working capital or that our working capital management procedures will successfully mitigate this risk 
our business is highly regulated extensive or frequent changes in regulations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing state and federal regulation 
we are required to comply with complex laws and regulations at the federal  state and local government levels relating to  among other things billing for services  relationships with physicians and other federal sources  adequacy and medical necessity of medical care  adequacy of documentation of services provided  quality of medical equipment and services  qualifications of medical and support personnel  confidentiality  maintenance and security issues associated with health related information and medical records  licensure  operating policies and procedures  addition of facilities and services including certificates of need  and pharmacy operations 
new laws and regulations are enacted from time to time to regulate new and existing services and products in the home healthcare industry 
because many of these laws and regulations are relatively new and are complex  we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws also could have an adverse effect on our methods and costs of doing business 
failure to comply with applicable regulations may subject us to fines  penalties or exclusion from participation in government programs 
as part of the extensive federal and state regulation of our business  we are subject to audits  examinations and investigations by or at the direction of governmental investigatory and oversight agencies 
failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to provide  or receive 
table of contents reimbursement for  our products and services and also could subject us and our officers to civil and criminal penalties 
such investigations and suits could result in significant financial sanctions or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
recently  enforcement of federal fraud and abuse laws and regulatory scrutiny generally  have increasingly focused on the home healthcare industry 
there can be no assurance that we will not become the subject of a regulatory or other investigation or proceeding or that we will not encounter regulatory impediments that could adversely affect our ability to open new branch offices and to expand the services currently provided at our existing branch offices 
there can be no assurance that current or future government regulation will not have an adverse effect upon our business 
we depend on the efforts of healthcare professionals  the loss of whose services could adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent upon our staff of professional nurses  respiratory therapists and pharmacists 
competition for healthcare professionals who possess the skills  experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our patients is strong  and salaries and benefit costs relating to these professionals have risen 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract  retain or motivate sufficient numbers of qualified healthcare professionals could adversely affect our business 
future changes to the supply and demand for certain healthcare professionals could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and on our ability to maintain or increase our patient base at certain or all of our branch offices 
an inability to continue to increase the number of professionals we recruit and retain would adversely affect our potential for growth 
the cost of attracting healthcare professionals and providing them with attractive benefit packages may be higher than anticipated and  as a result  our profitability could decline 
moreover  if we are unable to attract and retain these professionals  the quality of our services may decline and  as a result  we could lose patients 
we rely on a few key executives and other employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 
we depend on a few key executives  and the loss of their services could materially adversely affect our company 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of those executives 
we must be able to attract and retain other qualified  essential employees for our technical  operating and professional staff 
if we are unable to attract and retain these essential employees  our business could be harmed 
we participate in a highly competitive market and competitive pressures may result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability 
the markets for our healthcare services are highly competitive and are divided among a large number of providers  some of which are national providers  but most of which are either regional or local providers 
in addition to competing with other home healthcare companies focusing on providing services to pediatric patients  we compete with several large national home healthcare companies that  while not focusing primarily on the pediatric patient  provide pediatric home healthcare services as part of a broader service offering 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing sales resources than we have and may  in certain locations  possess licenses or certificates that permit them to provide services that we cannot currently provide 
the competitors also may undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees and clients 
increased competition in the future from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to maintain or increase our business and could adversely affect our operating results 
our business involves a major risk of lawsuits for product and malpractice liability  which our insurance may not be adequate to cover  that could increase the risk of our business 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our business involves a major risk of workers compensation claims and losses  which our insurance may not be adequate to cover  that could increase the risk of our business 
as a result of operating in the home healthcare industry  our business entails an inherent risk of claims  losses and potential lawsuits alleging employee accidents which are likely to occur in a patient s home 
as such  these incidents are typically un witnessed and require proactive claims adjustment strategies to minimize expected losses and mitigate exposure to fraudulent claims 
see recent developments below 
our potential inability to react effectively to changes in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our operating results 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including efforts at national healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  limits in medicare coverage and reimbursement levels  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office based healthcare practitioners 
the impact of third party pricing pressures and low barriers to entry has dramatically reduced profit margins for healthcare providers 
continued growth in managed care and capitated plans has pressured healthcare providers to find ways of becoming more cost competitive 
this has also led to consolidation of healthcare providers in our market areas 
our inability to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our operating results 
we cannot predict whether any healthcare reform efforts will be enacted and what effect any such reforms may have on us or our customers and suppliers 
our operations could be disrupted if our management information systems fail  causing increased expenses and loss of information 
our business depends in part upon our ability to input  store  retrieve  process and manage billing and collection information for each patient 
our internally developed system provides substantially all of our locations with immediate access to patient  contract  and payor information and supports substantially all necessary billing  cash posting  and collection services 
we continue to make improvements in billing functionality to comply with payor contract requirements 
we also continue to invest in upgrades to our technical infrastructure to maximize information system reliability  data integrity and disaster recoverability 
there can be no assurance that our information systems will continue to perform as expected  or that further development will not be required 
failure of our management information systems to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business could be affected if we are unable to deploy the proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy business 
our growth depends in part on our ability to start up or identify  acquire and integrate pdn businesses to replace the earnings stream of the pharmacy business 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risk relating to our common stock the market price of our common stock may experience substantial fluctuations for reasons over which we have little or no control 
the stock price and the number of shares traded of companies in the healthcare and health services industry experience periods of significant volatility 
both company specific and industry wide developments may cause this volatility 
the market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate up or down substantially based on a variety of factors  including the following sales of stock by large shareholders for reasons unrelated to our performance or future prospects  
table of contents future announcements concerning us  our competitors  the payors with whom we have relationships or the healthcare market  changes in operating results from quarter to quarter  sales of stock by insiders  changes in government regulations  news reports relating to trends in our markets  acquisitions and financings in our industry  and overall volatility of the stock market 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
these fluctuations  coupled with changes in our results of operations and general economic  political and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because we have paid no dividends on our common stock  you will only be able to benefit from holding our stock if the stock price increases 
we have paid no dividends on our common stock 
we anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings  if any  and cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmacy business for use in the operation and expansion of our business 
therefore  you are not likely to receive dividends in the foreseeable future  and you will only be able to benefit from holding our stock if the stock price increases 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a change in control 
we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition to our stockholder rights plan  some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as delaware law may be deemed to have an anti takeover effect or may delay or make more difficult an acquisition or change in control not approved by our board of directors  whether by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  a proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions could have the effect of discouraging third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition or change in control  although such a proposal  if made  might be considered desirable by a majority of our stockholders 
these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements of our company included in this report 
executive summary recent developments home healthcare industry events updates historically  medicare reimbursement for covered drugs has been limited to percent of the published average wholesale price awp for the drug 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma established new payment limits and procedures for drugs reimbursed under medicare part b  including drugs used for inhalation therapy 
the final rule  as the mma required  provides that medicare beneficiaries will be reimbursed at a rate of percent of the volume weighted average selling price the asp 
in addition  providers of inhalation therapy drugs  including our company  will receive a dispensing fee for supplying such drugs 
for calendar year  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms has significantly reduced its dispensing fee from levels  providing a dispensing fee for a thirty day prescription of for the first time a medicare beneficiary uses inhalation drugs and for subsequent months 
for ninety day prescriptions  medicare will pay a dispensing fee of we are continuing to assess the impact of these changes to our unit dose respiratory products to determine the long term profitability of our unit dose respiratory therapy business 
these and other changes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
for fiscal year  the impact of these regulations substantially reduced our profitability in the unit dose respiratory therapy business reported in the rtes segment see note 
there can be no assurance that we will not face increased margin pressures from the reimbursement changes or changes beyond a number of other pilot programs and demonstrations which are mandated by the mma signal the likelihood of continued re design of certain aspects of the medicare program 
while the more immediately visible changes mandated by the mma relate to extension of the medicare benefit to prescription drug coverage  other aspects may impact the operations and profitability of healthcare providers  including our company 
among other things  the mma mandates a phased in competitive bidding process for medicare procurement of certain durable medical equipment dme  commencing in the ten largest metropolitan statistical areas msas in  followed by the next eighty largest msas in moreover  the secretary of the united states department of health human services has the authority to apply competitive bidding nationally for the highest cost  highest volume items and services and those items and services that the secretary determines to have the largest savings potential 
there will also be at least a five year freeze in the consumer price index update for reimbursement rates for dme where competitive bidding prices are not applicable 
in addition  commencing in calendar year  reimbursement for certain items and services eg  oxygen and oxygen equipment that are not subject to competitive bidding was reduced based on the percentage difference between medicare s monthly payment amounts for each state and the median federal employee health plan price 
for fiscal year  the impact of these regulations reduced our profitability in the rtes segment 
there can be no assurance that we will not face increased margin pressures from subsequent reimbursement changes beyond in addition  the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  an independent federal body established to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program  has recommended implementation of pay for performance initiatives for home care providers 
if implemented  reimbursement to medicare providers will be differentiated based on quality measures 
while we provide high quality services to our patients  there can be no assurances that a pay for performance reimbursement system will not adversely affect our medicare reimbursement 
moreover  although medicare s conditions of participation for home health are being revised  cms has announced that their publication will be delayed until at least spring there can be no assurance that these and other changes will not adversely impact our operations and profits 

table of contents with respect to medicaid  the secretary of health and human services has announced an aggressive plan for medicaid reform 
in  the secretary established a medicaid commission  whose members include representatives from the pediatric provider community  to make recommendations for medicaid savings 
on september   the medicaid commission released its recommendations for achieving billion in medicaid savings over the next five years  and the commission is tasked with making longer term recommendations for medicaid reform by december  some of the commission s proposals may benefit the company  such as a proposal for increased utilization of community and home based services 
other proposals  such as extending the look back period for financial eligibility determinations  are anticipated largely to impact providers of long term care for the elderly 
nevertheless  it is possible that some federal medicaid reforms could adversely impact our operations and profits 
in addition to federal initiatives to decrease medicaid spending  many of the states in which we operate are discussing alternatives which could have the effect of restricting eligibility for medicaid benefits or increasing managed care administration of benefits 
in an effort to monitor and have an impact on these legislative issues  we have engaged consultants in selected markets to directly present our cost saving strategies and related rate requests to the medicaid programs 
during fiscal  we received rate increases for our private duty nursing services from two states 
in addition  our local market staff routinely collaborates with the appropriate community and regulatory authorities on our behalf as well as our patients 
as described in our prior sec filings  georgia medicaid s claims processing contractor missed the original implementation date of october   and delayed the go live date until april  for its multi health network claims processing system 
georgia medicaid is an important customer of ours and represents approximately of the company s annual billed revenue 
the company has made substantial progress and continues to work to resolve georgia medicaid receivables issues caused by the delayed and flawed implementation of multi health network  including correcting conflicts between provider numbers  categories of service  membership identification  units of measure  authorized duration of service and corresponding procedure codes within its authorization module 
based upon the information available to date  we believe we have recorded an adequate allowance against these receivable balances 
company events updates during fiscal year  we performed a strategic review of our business 
the purpose of this review was to conduct a rigorous evaluation of all possible strategic alternatives  select a strategic path that maximizes long term shareholder value  assess the management team s capabilities and identify any gaps in needed talents and skill sets  provide clarity to the tactical actions necessary to maximize the value of each segment of the business  and implement a communication plan which supports the chosen strategic path 
on september   the board of directors approved a plan to sell selected assets of what had historically been reported as the pharmacy business to accredo health group  inc a subsidiary of medco health solutions  inc on october   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell these assets for a purchase price of approximately million in cash 
on november   the transaction closed upon the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of as part of the transaction  the parties executed a transition services agreement that provides for the collection of outstanding accounts receivable and other items 
we anticipate exit costs to include transaction related costs  including  but not limited to  professional service fees  income tax liabilities  compensation and benefit costs  facility closure and related lease obligations  and contract termination costs 
we have estimated these exit costs to be approximately million 
we intend to use some of the proceeds of the transaction to retire our million senior subordinated notes due the notes 
our balance sheet has been reclassified to reflect these assets as held for sale and those financial results have been classified as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented 
however  we will retain the assets of the unit dose respiratory medication business and have reported the results of its operations as part of the rtes segment 

table of contents as a result of the assessment of the management team  we appointed a new vice president of human resources  vice president of compliance and vice president of business development 
the vice president of business development  mark kulik was brought on board along with a director of acquisitions to focus on our growth plans 
in addition  the position of vice president of ppec services was eliminated 
the ppec operations now report to the vice president of operations nursing 
we appointed our former vice president of reimbursement to the position of vice president of operations rtes and the director of internal audit as vice president of reimbursement 
we believe that the senior management team now has the requisite skill set to aggressively proceed down the selected strategic path 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our operations along the gulf coast including alabama  mississippi and louisiana were impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
after hurricane katrina  a significant displacement of our rtes patients in louisiana occurred 
as a result  we have downsized our local staff levels  established a reserve for equipment losses and experienced a significant decrease in our september  net revenue for these patients 
as we move forward  we anticipate continued operating losses in the region as we attempt to rebuild our patient base 
nevertheless  we believe louisiana is a key rtes market that we remain committed to serving 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted by us no later than the first fiscal year beginning after june  we will adopt statement r effective october  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement r for all that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r on our future financial statements cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the fluctuation in our share price 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share see note 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 

table of contents while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in the twelve months ended september   and for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million  respectively 
risk management we have spent significant time and resources to move towards a fully implemented enterprise risk management model 
this approach to risk management emphasizes assessment of risk from a broader perspective and relies upon significant employee education initiatives and awareness of a variety of risk exposures 
our full time risk manager  who possesses extensive homecare and occupational medicine experience  has strengthened the initial incident reporting and investigation process and actively monitors claim adjustment activities 
our risk committee  which is comprised of members of the compliance  legal  human resources  internal audit  finance and risk management departments  continues to monitor incident reporting and claim adjustment activity  review existing patient census and discharge high risk cases where legally permissible 
our risk committee employs a multi functional approach to its decision making process 
we continue to educate branch office staff on risk management procedures including appropriate nurse staffing decisions 
in addition  our third party actuary analyzes our medical malpractice loss history and quantifies liability recognition under the policy terms 
under our medical malpractice policy  we have a million per year  per claim  self insured retention  with an aggregate self insured retention limit of million and an annual aggregate coverage limit of million 
if our loss experience worsens it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity position 
operations we have three reportable segments i nursing  ii ppec and iii rtes see notes to consolidated financial statements note 
in the nursing segment  we continue to see pressures on both reimbursement levels and wage rates in key markets 
during fiscal  we continued to experience dramatic reductions in authorized levels of services from key medicaid states 
this trend in reduced authorized levels of care for specific patients continues to be an obstacle to this segment s future contribution margin expansion 
in order to address this trend  we have expanded our nurse recruiting and retention program to bring our local market recruiting staff to a total of ten 
we have established weekly staffed hours targets for each branch office as well as created an incentive program to reward achievement of these targets 
in addition  we have expanded our nurse visit programs in selected markets to respond to specific payor requests and reimbursement agreements 
to stimulate same store revenue growth  we have established financial incentives for our local market sales and marketing resources to maximize the potential of existing managed care contracts by pulling patient referrals through these relationships 
in the ppec segment  we are extremely pleased with the financial results of our georgia centers 
our census has continued to grow  community acceptance of our business model has expanded and feedback from state officials is overwhelmingly positive 
in north carolina our pilot project continues to demonstrate the desired outcomes and we remain hopeful that a permanent source of funding will be established in the upcoming state fiscal year 
in florida  the state has yet to remove the obstacles to patient access which severely limit our census levels 
we are hopeful that with the impending structural changes to the medicaid program recently announced by the governor  these obstacles can be removed 
in the rtes segment  we continue to invest in and expand our sales and marketing program 
we are focusing our sales and marketing efforts upon the higher acuity respiratory patients to leverage our clinical competencies and more actively manage the core product mix 
as a result  we have begun to see increases in target referrals from managed care payors in select markets 
however  we have experienced an increased rate of replacement for several equipment items in our core rental fleet 
these increasing capital expenditures reflect growing market acceptance of improved versions of these core products 
many of those items have become 
table of contents smaller and more portable and are increasingly requested by patients and referring physicians 
these items have higher acquisition costs and to date  reimbursement levels have not increased 
in addition  we are experiencing decreased reimbursement for certain disposable and supply items  as well as the elimination of reimbursement for other select items see home healthcare industry events updates above for additional discussion 
in order to address the continued margin pressures on our rtes segment  we utilize a product review committee to standardize product selections  aggregate product volumes  and source through a reduced number of vendors to maximize our purchasing power 
in an effort to achieve our desired objectives  michael davidson  formerly  vice president of reimbursement  was appointed to the position of vice president of operations rtes 
in this position  mr 
davidson will oversee both the continued development and day to day operations of this segment 
source availability of clinical personnel during the weeks ending october   our case hours staffed decreased to approximately  as compared to  in the weeks ended june  we continue to aggressively compete for nurses to staff hours ordered  retain nurses with select wage and benefit improvements and implement employee satisfaction initiatives 
we have made additional investments in ten new local market nurse recruiters to help reduce unstaffed hours 
we believe that case hours staffed is the most appropriate measurement of nursing activity 

table of contents critical accounting policies net revenue due to the nature of the healthcare industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods as additional information becomes available to us 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or settlement of account review 
as of september   we had no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with third party payors except as disclosed under the recent developments section above  nor were there any material pending settlements with third party payors 
net revenue represents the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for patient services rendered and products provided 
such net revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with payors 
net revenues to be reimbursed by contracts with third party payors are recorded at an amount to be realized under these contractual arrangements 
net revenues from medicaid and medicare are generally based on reimbursement of the reasonable direct and indirect costs of providing services to program participants 
in certain situations  the services and products are recorded separately 
in other situations  the services and products are billed and reimbursed on a per diem or contract basis whereby the insurance carrier pays us one combined amount for treatment 
because the reimbursement arrangements in these situations are based on a per diem or contract amount  we do not maintain records that provide a breakdown between the service and product components 
we have developed a methodology to record the estimated net revenue as a result of the inherent time lag between certain patient treatments and input of the related information into our billing and collection system 
this methodology measures relative changes in the time and overall activity level at each branch office location and aggregates these measurements to estimate the impact to consolidated net revenue 
the estimated net revenue from the inherent time lag was approximately  and of net revenue for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
any unforeseen volatility to either the time or activity level at specific branch offices has the potential to significantly impact the estimate 
in other select cases  patient treatments may cease for a number of reasons including re hospitalizations  changes in treatment needs or death  and a time lag may exist before this information is reflected in our billing and collection system 
we have developed a methodology which measures the historical experience over recent time periods and applies this methodology to reduce net revenues recognized in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the adequacy of the allowance and related provision for doubtful accounts  we have developed a process that combines detailed analysis of historical collections and write off activity with a detailed review of existing account balances meeting certain criteria and their likelihood of being collected at the amounts recorded 
this detailed review involves both the assigned corporate reimbursement department personnel and the respective branch office location personnel assessing each patient claim that falls within prescribed age and amount criteria 
these assessments are aggregated and compared to the results of the detailed analysis of historical collections to provide additional support to management in making the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inherent in this estimate is the risk that it will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management 

table of contents goodwill and other acquired intangible assets beginning in fiscal  the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
eliminated goodwill amortization from the consolidated statements of operations and required an evaluation of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
for these evaluations  we are using an implied fair value approach  which uses a discounted cash flow analysis and other valuation methodologies 
these evaluations use many assumptions and estimates in determining an impairment loss  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and comparable companies capital structure and earnings power 
there was no resulting impairment 
the sale of the pharmacy business was determined to be a triggering event requiring us to perform a second impairment test as of september  as a result of this test  there was no resulting impairment 
subsequent impairments  if any  would be classified as operating expenses 
intangible assets that meet certain criteria qualify for recording on the consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be amortized in the consolidated statements of operations 
such intangible assets will be subject to a periodic impairment test based on estimated fair value 
accrued insurance our insurance broker retains the services of an independent actuary to prepare an actuarial analysis of our development of incurred but not reported claims for workers compensation  medical malpractice and employee benefit plans 
these estimates are updated as determined necessary based on recent claims history and other events 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to us

subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement  the lender made available a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit and a million line of credit for acquisitions 
availability in both components is subject to a borrowing base calculation against our accounts receivable 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at libor plus or the index rate plus

table of contents risk management our workers compensation insurance carrier  rated a by am best company  required a twelve month estimated loss reserve to be funded entirely with cash each fiscal year  which is reduced by the monthly loss fund payments 
the net balance at september  and was million and million  respectively 
the insurance carrier has the right to increase this cash requirement at the end of each fiscal year if the claim experience is greater than anticipated  but to date has not indicated the need to do so 
the policy for fiscal will be funded in a similar manner with the cash requirement estimated to be million 
we have secured surety bonds of million to satisfy our workers compensation program requirements for our former insurance carrier 
as of september   the surety bonds were collateralized by million cash posted to a third party escrow account 
during november  we began the renewal process of our employee medical benefit plans 
our claim experience during to date has been within the range of our expectations under our self insured model 
as we move forward into we are making minor design changes to our benefits and analyzing the impact of the removal of the employees who will be transitioning to accredo health group  inc as part of the sale of the pharmacy business 
as a result of operating in the healthcare industry  our business entails an inherent risk of lawsuits alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal issues  which can involve large claims and significant defense costs 
from time to time  we are subject to such suits arising in the ordinary course of business 
we currently maintain professional and commercial liability insurance intended to cover such claims 
as of september   this insurance coverage is provided under a claims made policy which provides  subject to the terms and conditions of the policy  coverage for certain types of claims made against us during the term of the policy and does not provide coverage for losses occurring during the terms of the policy for which a claim is made subsequent to the termination of the policy 
should the policy not be renewed or replaced with equivalent insurance  claims based on occurrences during its term but asserted subsequently would be uninsured 
there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policy will be adequate 
on october   we completed our annual renewal of our risk management program and implemented several changes 
we renewed our insurance program for medical malpractice  commercial and general liability coverage with arch specialty insurance company  rated a by am best company 
per claim self insured retention amount remained at million with an annual aggregate self insured retention amount of million and an annual aggregate coverage limit of million 
we changed carriers for our workers compensation policy to charter oak fire insurance  a subsidiary of st 
paul travelers  rated a by am best company  with the per claim deductible remaining at million 
in addition  we are subject to accident claims arising out of the normal operation of our fleet of vans and small trucks  and we maintain insurance intended to cover such claims 
a successful claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
claims against us  regardless of their merits or eventual outcome  also may have a material adverse effect upon our reputation and business 
we are  from time to time  subject to lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business  some of which may allege damages which would not be covered under our existing insurance policies 
there can be no assurance that settlement of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
capital resources the indenture under which the notes were issued allows us to repurchase the notes at our discretion 
all bids to repurchase have been based upon a number of factors including cash availability  interest rates on invested cash  other capital investment alternatives  and relative ask prices quoted by the market maker 
we intend to redeem all of the outstanding notes  in accordance with the applicable provisions of the indenture  with part of the proceeds from the sale of select assets of the pharmacy business 

table of contents we intend to invest the excess proceeds from the sale of the pharmacy business in accordance with the terms of our investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors 
this policy provides for the establishment of short term  highly liquid investments within prescribed parameters 
we currently believe that our liquidity position will be adequate to satisfy our working capital requirements  professional and commercial liability insurance loss funding  workers compensation collateral requirements  and income tax payments 
our current sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of select assets of the pharmacy business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in cash collection results

the company recently received notification of a claim from one commercial payor primarily relating to our discontinued pharmacy operation see note during the quarter ended september   we received a favorable determination from the administrative law judge regarding the medicare audit appeal previously discussed in our prior sec filings 
the settlement reached resolved this matter within our estimated liability of million see note 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain employees which provide  among other things  salary  benefits and perquisites  as well as additional compensation  for certain changes in control or a failure to comply with any material terms of the agreements 
we have a non qualified deferred compensation plan for certain of our employees

the following table represents a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt subordinated notes operating leases continuing operations operating leases discontinued operations variation in quarterly operating results our quarterly results may vary significantly depending primarily on factors such as re hospitalizations of patients  seasonality and usage levels of pharmaceutical products and respiratory services  the timing of new branch office openings and pricing pressures due to legislative and regulatory initiatives to contain healthcare costs 
because of these factors  our operating results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for the full fiscal year 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face a number of market risk exposures including risks related to cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and interest rates 
cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in one financial institution 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of this financial institution 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable  which are primarily healthcare industry related  represent a risk to us given the current environment in the healthcare industry 
the risk is somewhat limited due to the large number of payors including medicare and medicaid  insurance companies  individuals and the diversity of geographic locations in which we operate 
however  we have substantial geographic density in the eastern united states  which we believe exposes us to payor initiated reimbursement changes 
our notes  issued in  have a fixed coupon rate of 
the fair value of our notes is subject to change as a result of changes in market prices or interest rates 
we estimate potential changes in the fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments based on the hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account other factors such as our financial performance and credit ratings 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at september  and  the market value of our notes would be reduced by approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the market value of our notes outstanding at september  and of approximately million and million  respectively
