item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contractual obligations for disclosure of approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature 
in addition  our and mission s high level of debt requires us and mission to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
we and mission could also incur additional debt in the future 
the terms of our and mission s senior credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt 
to the extent we or mission incur additional debt  we would become even more susceptible to the leverage related risks described above 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our business 
our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our publicly held notes contain various covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets or stock of our subsidiaries  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  our senior credit facility requires us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios  including consolidated leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios 
future financing agreements may contain similar  or even more restrictive  provisions and covenants 
as a result of these restrictions and covenants  our management s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited  and we may be unable to compete effectively  pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities  any of which could harm our business 
mission s senior credit facility contains similar terms and restrictions 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements  a default may occur 
a default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
a default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt 
mission may make decisions regarding the operation of its stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements 
mission is owned by an independent third party 
mission owns and operates the following television stations wyou  wfxp  kjtl  kjbo lp  kode  krbc  ksan formerly kacb  kolr  khmt  kamc  kcit  kcpn lp  wutr  wbak and wtvo the acquisition of wtvo by mission closed on january  
we have entered into various local service agreements with mission pursuant to which we provide services to mission s stations 
in return for the services we provide  we receive substantially all of the available cash  after payment of debt service costs  generated by mission s stations 
we also guarantee all of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  which were incurred primarily in connection with mission s acquisition of its stations 
in addition  the sole shareholder of mission has granted us a purchase option to acquire the assets and liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s broadcast cash flow as defined in the option agreement less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement or the amount of its indebtedness 

table of contents we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however  we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in them under us gaap 
in order for our arrangements with mission under the local service agreements to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
as a result  mission s sole shareholder and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and  as a consequence  the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with mission 
for instance  we may disagree with mission s programming decisions  which programming may prove unpopular and or may generate less advertising revenue 
furthermore  subject to mission s agreement with its lenders  mission s sole shareholder could choose to pay himself a dividend 
the revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms  or at all 
due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks  stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market 
as a result  it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations 
except for mission owned kcpn lp  all of the stations we operate or provide services to have affiliation agreements with a network twelve stations have primary affiliation agreements with nbc  eight with cbs  nine with abc  twelve with fox and three with upn 
each of nbc  cbs and abc generally provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week  while each of fox and upn provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  affiliated stations broadcast the respective network s commercials during the network programming 
under the affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  affiliated stations also receive cash compensation from these networks 
all of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times beginning in june through january  except for one network affiliation agreement which can be terminated upon days prior written notice by the network 
we are currently in negotiation with abc regarding the network affiliation agreement for three of our stations  all of which expired in january mission is currently in similar discussion with abc regarding the network affiliation agreement for one of its stations 
abc has granted short term extensions of the existing agreements as renewal discussions continue 
network affiliation agreements are also subject to earlier termination by the networks under limited circumstances 
for more information regarding these network affiliation agreements  see business network affiliations 
the loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of perry a 
sook  our founder  president and chief executive officer 
mr 
sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus 
the loss of mr 
sook s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations 
the television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation  which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets 
therefore  even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets  we may face considerable competition and our acquisition strategy may not be successful 
fcc rules and policies may also make it more difficult for us to acquire or enter into local service agreements with additional television stations 
television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions if  for example  the fcc or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
growing our business through acquisitions involves risks and if we are unable to manage effectively our rapid growth  our operating results will suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth 
since january   we have more than doubled the number of stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to  having acquired stations and contracted to provide service to additional stations 
we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities 
to manage effectively our growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions  we will need  among other things  to continue to develop our financial and management controls and management information systems 
we will also need to continue to identify  attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel 
failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business 

table of contents there are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions 
for example  with any past or future acquisition  there is the possibility that we may not be able to successfully reduce costs  increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station  an acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities  our management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business  we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems  as well as  company policies and cultures  we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business  and problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition 
fcc actions may restrict our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements  which would harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy 
we have created duopolies in some of our markets by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements 
while these agreements take varying forms  a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station s owner 
by operating or entering into local service agreements with more than one station in a market  we achieve significant operational efficiencies  broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market 
while our existing local service agreements comply with fcc rules and policies  we cannot assure you that the fcc will continue to permit local service agreements as a means of creating duopoly type opportunities  or that the fcc will not challenge our existing arrangements with mission or sinclair broadcast group  inc in the future 
on august   the fcc initiated a rule making proceeding to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements attributable under its ownership rules 
comments and reply comments were filed in this proceeding in the fourth quarter of the fcc has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding 
however  if the fcc adopts a jsa attribution rule for tv stations we will be required to comply with the rule 
in addition  if in response to a third party complaint  the fcc challenges our existing arrangements with mission or sinclair and determines that such arrangements violate the fcc s rules or policies  we may be required to terminate such arrangements and we could be subject to sanctions  fines and or other penalties 
the fcc may decide to terminate grandfathered time brokerage agreements 
the fcc attributes toward the local television ownership limits in market stations when one station owner programs a second in market station pursuant to a time brokerage agreement tba or local marketing agreement  if the programmer provides more than percent of the second station s weekly broadcast programming 
however  local marketing agreements entered into prior to november  are exempt attributable interests for now 
the fcc likely will review these grandfathered tbas during or during this review  the fcc may determine to terminate the grandfathered period and make all tbas fully attributable to the programmer 
if the fcc does so  nexstar and mission will be required to terminate the tbas for stations wfxp and khmt  unless the fcc simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets 
failure to construct full power dtv facilities may lead to a loss of station coverage area or other fcc sanctions 
fcc regulations required all commercial television stations in the united states to commence digital operations by may   in addition to continuing their analog operations  unless an extension of time was granted 
except for wfxv  wqrf and knwa formerly kfaa  all of the television stations we and mission own and operate or provide services to are broadcasting at least a low power digital television signal 
wqrf received its dtv construction permit on november and has until november to construct dtv facilities 
wfxv received its dtv construction permit on january  and has until january  to construct its dtv facilities 
jdg television  inc jdg tv  the former licensee of knwa  had until march  to construct dtv facilities for the station 
on february   jdg tv filed a request for extension of time to construct the dtv facilities  the fcc has not yet acted on this request 
on august   jdg tv requested fcc consent to modify knwa s proposed dtv facilities 
the fcc granted knwa a modified dtv construction permit  establishing a construction deadline of march  on january   we filed a request with the fcc to extend knwa s modified construction permit deadline 
when the fcc acts on our extension request  we will have six months to complete construction of knwa s dtv facilities 
if knwa is not broadcasting a digital signal by the end of this six month period we could be subject to further sanctions  including  eventually  loss of the dtv construction permit 

table of contents the digital transmissions may initially be low power  but full power transmission will be required by july  for stations affiliated with the four largest networks abc  cbs  nbc and fox affiliates in the top markets and by july  for all other stations 
stations that fail to meet these build out deadlines will lose interference protection for their signals outside the low power coverage area 
the fcc stated it plans to establish a limited waiver process for stations that cannot meet the full power dtv deadlines due to severe financial constraints or circumstances beyond licensee control such as zoning issues 
for each of the stations we and mission own and operate or provide services to that do not obtain a waiver and are not broadcasting a full power digital signal by the deadlines set by the fcc  such station may lose its interference protection  which could have a material adverse effect on the station 
the interest of our principal stockholder  abry partners  llc and its affiliated funds abry  in other media may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under fcc rules 
the broadcast or other media interest of our officers  directors and stockholders with or greater voting power are generally attributable under the fcc s rules  which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of otherwise non attributable equity and or debt in a licensee in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or daily newspaper in the same market 
abry  our principal stockholder  is one of the largest private firms specializing in media and broadcasting investments 
as a result of abry s interest in us  we could be prevented from acquiring broadcast companies in markets where abry has an attributable interest in television stations or other media  which could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
our certificate of incorporation allows abry and its affiliates to identify  pursue and consummate additional acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisitions opportunities may not be available to us 
we are controlled by one principal stockholder  abry  and its interests may differ from your interests 
as a result of abry s controlling interest in us  abry is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs 
abry is able to unilaterally determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  five of our directors are or were affiliated with abry 
abry s interests may differ from the interests of other securityholders and abry could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our securityholders 
furthermore  this concentration of ownership by abry may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
our certification of incorporation  bylaws  debt instruments and delaware law contain anti takeover protections that may discourage or prevent a takeover of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us  even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock by our board of directors without a stockholder vote  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and set forth specific advance notice procedures for matters to be raised at stockholder meetings 
the delaware general corporation law prohibits us from engaging in business combinations with interested shareholders with some exceptions unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner 
the existence of this provision could have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 
in addition  a change in control would be an event of default under our senior credit facility and trigger the rights of holders of our publicly traded notes to cause us to repurchase such notes 
these events would add to the cost of an acquisition  which could deter a third party from acquiring us 
nexstar and mission have a history of net losses and a substantial accumulated deficit 
nexstar and mission had consolidated net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily as a result of amortization of intangible assets and debt service obligations 
in addition  as of december   nexstar and mission had a combined accumulated deficit of million 
nexstar and mission may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 

table of contents nexstar and mission have a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets  and if nexstar and mission are required to write down goodwill and intangible assets in future periods in compliance with prevailing accounting standards  it would reduce nexstar and mission s net income  which in turn could materially and adversely affect nexstar and mission s results of operations 
approximately million  or  of nexstar and mission s combined total assets as of december   consist of goodwill and unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include network affiliation agreements and fcc licenses 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
which became effective on january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses  and the introduction of impairment testing in its place 
sfas no 
also required nexstar and mission to complete a transitional test of goodwill and fcc licenses for impairment and  as a result  nexstar and mission recorded goodwill impairment loss of million  net of taxes  which has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we and mission completed our annual tests for impairment of goodwill and fcc licenses as of december  and with impairment being recognized in and from this testing 
risks related to our industry nexstar s operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result  nexstar may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond nexstar s control than businesses not dependent on advertising 
nexstar derives revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time 
nexstar s ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond nexstar s control  including the health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  fluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based media  particularly newspapers  cable television  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located 
because businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns  the reliance upon advertising revenue makes nexstar s operating results particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions 
in general  advertising revenue declined substantially in due in large part to the economic recession and the terrorist attack on september  we cannot assure you that our programming will attract sufficient targeted viewership or that we will achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenue to decline 
in addition  we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate  and effectively react to  shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets 
because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed  a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
our business is characterized generally by high fixed costs  primarily for debt service  broadcast rights and personnel 
other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies  our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue 
as a result  a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
foreign hostilities and further terrorist attacks may affect our revenue and results of operations 
nexstar may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses in the event the united states of america engages in foreign hostilities or in the event there is a terrorist attack against the united states of america 
a significant news event like a war or terrorist attack will likely result in the preemption of regularly scheduled programming by network news coverage of the event 
as a result  advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the broadcast station is able to run the advertising at agreed upon times in the future 
there can be no assurance that advertisers will agree to run such advertising in future time periods or that space will be available for such advertising 
we cannot predict the duration of such preemption of local programming if it occurs 
in addition  our broadcasting stations may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of the local impact of a war or terrorist attack 
the loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect nexstar s results of operations 

table of contents the industry wide mandatory conversion to digital television will require us to make significant capital expenditures for which we might not see a return on our investment 
it will be expensive to convert from the current analog format to digital format 
this conversion required an average initial capital expenditure of approximately million per station for low power transmission of digital signal programming  and we estimate that it will require an average additional capital expenditure of approximately million per station for stations to modify our and mission s stations dtv transmitters for full power digital signal transmission  including costs for the transmitter  transmission line  antenna and installation  and estimated costs for tower upgrades and or modifications 
digital conversion expenditures were million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the transition to dtv eventually will require consumers to purchase new televisions that are capable of receiving and displaying dtv signals  or adapters to receive dtv signals and convert them to analog signals for display on their existing receivers 
currently  very few households have either a digital television or an adapter 
it is possible that most households will never make the switch to digital television 
such households would not be able to view our stations signals over the air if the fcc requires us to cease broadcasting analog signals 
if this happens our investment in upgrading our stations to broadcast digitally will have been largely wasted with respect to such households 
in addition  digital technology could expose us to additional competition since digital technology allows broadcasting of multiple channels within the additional allocated spectrum  compared to only one channel today using analog technology 
we do not know what effect this will have on the competitive landscape in our industry 
if direct broadcast satellite companies do not carry the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose revenue and audience share 
the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act allows direct broadcast satellite television companies to continue transmitting local broadcast television signals to subscribers in local markets provided that they offer to carry all local stations in that market 
however  satellite providers have limited satellite capacity to deliver local station signals in local markets 
satellite providers  such as directv and echostar  carry our and mission s stations in only some of our markets and may choose not to carry local stations in any of our other markets 
directv currently provides satellite carriage of our and mission s stations only in the little rock pine bluff  shreveport  wilkes barre scranton  ft 
wayne  springfield  evansville  peoria  rochester  ft 
smith fayetteville springdale rogers and champaign springfield decatur markets 
echostar currently provides satellite carriage of our and mission s stations only in the abilene  amarillo  abilene  champaign springfield decatur  evansville  fort wayne  ft 
smith fayetteville springdale rogers  joplin  mo pittsburg  ks  little rock pine bluff  lubbock  monroe  la el dorado  ar  peoria  rochester  rockford  terre haute  wichita falls  tx lawton  ok  shreveport  springfield and wilkes barre scranton markets 
in those markets in which the satellite providers do not carry local station signals  subscribers to those satellite services are unable to view local stations without making further arrangements  such as installing antennas and switches 
furthermore  when direct broadcast satellite companies do carry local television stations in a market  they are permitted to charge subscribers extra for such service 
some subscribers may choose not to pay extra to receive local television stations 
in the event subscribers to satellite services do not receive the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose audience share which would adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
if we are unable to reach retransmission consent agreements with cable companies for the carriage of our stations signals  we could lose audience share and revenue 
the communications act permits stations to elect between retransmission consent and mandatory carriage must carry in connection with the carriage of their stations signals by cable companies 
nexstar s stations have elected to exercise their retransmission consent rights and have negotiated agreements with cable companies for the carriage of its stations signals 
some of mission s stations also have elected retransmission consent and have negotiated agreements with cable companies for the carriage of these stations signals 
on december   our and mission s retransmission consent agreements with cox communications  inc for the carriage of stations klst and krbc expired 
also on december   our and mission s retransmission consent agreements with cable one  inc for ksnf  ktal and kode expired 
on february   our retransmission consent agreement with cox for ktal expired 
we and mission have been unable to reach new agreements with cox or cable one for the carriage of these stations 
if new agreements with cox or cable one are not reached  we and mission could lose audience share which would affect our revenue 
we are currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters  but do not believe they will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the fcc can sanction us for programming on our stations which it finds to be indecent 
in  the fcc imposed substantial fines on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the communications act and its rules 
the fcc also revised its indecency review analysis to more strictly prohibit the use of certain language on broadcast television 
because our and mission s stations programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated  we and mission do not have full control over what is broadcast on our stations  and we and mission may be subject to the imposition of fines if the fcc finds such programming to be indecent 

table of contents in addition  congress currently is considering legislation that will substantially increase the maximum amount the fcc can fine broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent programming and may consider permitting the fcc to institute license revocation proceedings against any station which repeatedly violates the indecency regulations 
intense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and impair our ability to become profitable 
as a television broadcasting company  we face a significant level of competition  both directly and indirectly 
generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage in rather than watch television 
specifically  stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share  programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media  including newspapers  radio stations  cable television and the internet 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  is highly competitive and is undergoing a period of consolidation 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
the markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from  among other things  technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment  such as cable television  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view and home video and entertainment systems  have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to increased competition 
we may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions 
we are unable to predict what form of competition will develop in the future  the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our businesses 
in addition  on february   the us court of appeals for the us circuit directed the fcc to repeal in its entirety the local television cable cross ownership rule  which prohibited any cable television system from carrying the signal of any television broadcast station with a predicted service area that overlaps  in whole or in part  the cable system s service area  if the cable system or any of its attributable principals had an attributable interest in the television station 
as a result of such repeal  cable systems and co located television stations now may be commonly owned 
this means that the operator of a cable system that carries one of the stations we own or provide services to can be the owner of a competing station in the market 
on june   the fcc eliminated its radio television cross ownership rule and its local television newspaper cross ownership rule  replacing both with a new single cross media ownership rule 
under this new rule  a daily newspaper  under certain circumstances  may be able to own a television station in the same market 
this means that the owner of a local newspaper could become the owner of a competing station in the market 
this rule was to become effective on september  however  on september   a three judge panel of the us court of appeals for the third circuit stayed the effectiveness of the new rule and on june   the court remanded the rule back to the fcc for further consideration 
on january   the national association of broadcasters and other industry parties requested the us supreme court to review the third circuit s decision 
for more information about this rule  which also remains subject to petitions for reconsideration at the fcc and congressional review and modification  see business federal regulation of television broadcasting cross media ownership

introduction we own and operate television stations as of december  through various local service agreements with mission  we currently program or provide sales and other services to additional television stations 
mission is owned by an independent third party 
mission owns and operates television stations as of december  we do not own mission or its television stations 
in order for both us and mission to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
however  as a result of our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility and our arrangements under the local service agreements and purchase option agreements with 
table of contents mission described below  we are deemed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission 
the following table summarizes the various local service agreements we have implemented as of december  with mission service agreements mission stations tba only wfxp and khmt ssa jsa kjtl  kjbo lp  kolr  kcit  kcpn lp  kamc  krbc  ksan formerly kacb  wutr  wbak  wyou  kode and wtvo we have a tba with these stations which allows us to program most of each station s broadcast time  sell each station s advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to mission 
we have both an ssa and a jsa with these stations 
the ssa allows the sharing of services including news production  technical maintenance and security  in exchange for our right to receive certain payments from mission as described in the ssas 
the jsas permit us to sell and receive the net revenue from the station s advertising time in return for monthly payments to mission 
wtvo was not owned by mission as of december   although it was operated by mission under a tba with young broadcasting  inc and winnebago television corporation 
on january    mission consummated the acquisition of wtvo and operations under the tba terminated 
our ability to receive cash from mission is governed by these agreements 
the arrangements under the ssas and jsas have the effect of us receiving substantially all of the available cash  after debt service costs  generated by the above listed stations 
the arrangements under the tbas have the effect of nexstar receiving substantially all of the available cash generated by the remaining stations listed above 
we anticipate that we will continue to receive substantially all of the available cash  after payments for debt service costs  generated by the above listed stations 
in addition to the above local service agreements  nexstar also guarantees the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility 
similarly  mission is a guarantor of the senior secured credit facility entered into by nexstar and the senior subordinated notes issued by nexstar 
the sole shareholder of mission has granted us a purchase option to acquire the assets and liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s broadcast cash flow as defined in the option agreement less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement or the amount of its indebtedness 
these option agreements are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by the sole shareholder of mission 
we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however  as a result of our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility and our arrangements under the local service agreements and purchase option agreements with mission  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission while complying with the fcc s rules regarding ownership limits in television markets 
in order for both nexstar and mission to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
as a result of nexstar s controlling financial interest in mission under us gaap and in order to present fairly our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  we consolidate the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of mission as if it were a wholly owned entity 
we believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding nexstar s financial performance 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have considered the method of accounting under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation on accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
as revised in december fin no 
r and have determined that we are required to continue consolidating mission s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
therefore  the following discussion of nexstar s financial position and results of operations includes mission s financial position and results of operations 
in addition to our agreements with mission  pursuant to an outsourcing agreement that became effective december   with a subsidiary of sinclair broadcast group  inc sinclair  we provide engineering  production  sales and administrative services for wyzz  the fox affiliate in the peoria bloomington  illinois market 
the parties share the combined broadcast cash flow as defined in the outsourcing agreement generated by wyzz and nexstar owned  wmbd 
the outsourcing agreement expires in december  but at any time it may be canceled by either party upon days written notice 
we have evaluated the arrangement under fin no 
and determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of wyzz 
the operating revenue of our stations is derived primarily from advertising revenue  which in turn depends on the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate  the demographic makeup of those markets and the marketing strategy we employ in each market 
our primary operating expenses consist of commissions on advertising revenue  employee compensation and related benefits  newsgathering and programming costs 
a large percentage of the costs involved in the operation of our stations remain relatively fixed 
each of our stations and the stations we provide services to  except for kcpn lp  has a network affiliation agreement pursuant to which the network provides programming to the station during specified time periods  including prime time 
each of nbc  cbs and abc compensates the affiliated stations for distributing the network s programming over the air and for allowing the network to keep a portion of advertising inventory during those time periods 
the affiliation agreements with fox and upn do not provide for compensation 
each station acquires licenses to broadcast programming in non news and non network time periods 
the licenses are 
table of contents either purchased from a program distributor for cash and or the program distributor is allowed to sell some of the advertising inventory as compensation to eliminate or reduce the cash cost for the license 
the latter practice is referred to as barter broadcast rights 
the station records the estimated fair market value of the licenses  including any advertising inventory given to the program distributor  as a broadcast right asset and liability 
the assets are amortized as a component of amortization of broadcast rights 
amortization is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or usage  whichever yields the greater expense 
the cash broadcast rights liabilities are reduced by monthly payments while the barter liability is amortized over the life of the contract as a component of trade and barter revenue 
advertising rates are based upon a program s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target  the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station  the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area  and the effectiveness of the station s sales force 
advertising rates are also determined by a station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area  as well as the station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting 
advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies  national and regional political election campaigns  and certain events such as the olympic games or the super bowl 
because television broadcast stations rely on advertising revenue  declines in advertising budgets  particularly in recessionary periods  adversely affect the broadcast industry  and as a result may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run for a few weeks 
excluding political revenue  and of nexstar s and mission s consolidated spot revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively  was generated from local advertising 
the remaining advertising revenue represents inventory sold for national or political advertising 
each station has an agreement with a national representative firm that provides for representation outside the particular station s market 
national commission rates vary within the industry and are governed by each station s agreement 
all national and political revenue is derived from advertisements placed by advertising agencies 
the agencies receive a commission rate of of the gross amount of advertising schedules placed by them 
while the majority of local spot revenue is placed by local agencies  some advertisers place their schedules directly with the stations local sales staff  thereby eliminating the agency commission 
the stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years resulting from political advertising and advertising aired during the olympic games 
industry trends two significant industry wide factors influenced the company s performance during although historical market trends would have dictated a slight increase in revenue for  the us advertising market experienced a significant slowdown during as evidenced by a decrease in market time sales for television as reported by the television bureau of advertising tvb 
this was primarily the result of the war in iraq  which began in the first quarter of the market began to stabilize and showed signs of recovery towards the end of and continued throughout net broadcast revenue on a same station basis increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  also  political revenue is a factor when comparing the company s results for the three year period 
during an election year even numbered years  political revenue makes up a significant portion of the increase in revenue in that year 
the results include the impact of additional advertising related to regional elections for governorships and congressional seats 
since was an election year  a large percentage of the company s revenue growth in was attributable to political revenue 
political revenue was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and however  even during an election year  political revenue is influenced by geography and the competitiveness of the election races 
local service agreements and acquisitions the local service agreements and acquisitions described below  which were entered into by nexstar and mission during the fiscal years ended december   and  affect the year to year comparability of the operating results discussed below in december  mission entered into a purchase agreement and a tba with gocom broadcasting of joplin  llc a subsidiary of the company now known as piedmont television holdings  llc with regard to kode  the abc affiliate in the joplin  missouri pittsburg  kansas market

as a result  wcfn became a full power station capable of generating revenue of its own 
for discussion purposes on a same station basis  nexstar has excluded wcfn s revenue and expenses

nexstar and mission have requested that the cable operators pay a cash per subscriber fee in exchange for the cable operators rights to carry the stations signals under new agreements 
the cable operators have informed nexstar and mission that they will not pay any cash fees for the carriage of the stations on their systems 
on january   one of the cable operators submitted a complaint for enforcement to the fcc requesting that the fcc instruct nexstar and mission to negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent agreements for klst and krbc 
on february   nexstar and mission submitted their joint response to the complaint 
on february   one of the cable operators filed a response to the filing made by nexstar and mission 
this matter remains pending before the fcc 
if nexstar and mission do not reach new agreements with the cable operators  the stations in the affected markets could lose audience share which may impact the stations revenue

this expense has no impact on our cash flows 
based primarily on our recent history of net operating losses  we do not consider the realization of our net deferred tax assets to be more likely than not 
accordingly  we have provided a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets excluding deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets

liquidity and capital resources we and mission are highly leveraged  which makes the company vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions 
our and mission s ability to repay or refinance debt will depend on  among other things  financial  business  market  competitive and other conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
based on current operations and anticipated future growth  we believe that our and mission s available cash  anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditure requirements  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents sources and uses of cash for the year ended december  cash flows overview as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million  compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the major components of these changes are discussed below 
cash flows operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities include net loss adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital  including changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable  broadcast rights asset and liability and other accrued assets and liabilities 
the comparative increase in cash flows provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to the increase in net revenue 
cash flows investing activities cash used for investing activities was million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital additions and funding of acquisitions 
capital expenditures were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
we estimate that full year capital expenditures will be approximately million to million  excluding acquisition related spending 
cash used for acquisitions was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash used for acquisitions for the year ended december  included the million payment  exclusive of transaction costs  by mission for the acquisition of wutr  the remaining million payment  exclusive of transaction costs  by mission for the acquisition of wbak  the total payment by nexstar of million  exclusive of transaction costs  for the acquisition of klst  the initial payment by mission of million  exclusive of transaction costs  for the acquisition of wtvo  the payment by mission of million for the accounts receivable of wtvo as of november  and ongoing capital expenditures

the change in cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of borrowings of million under the senior credit facilities  the repayment of million of previous borrowings under the senior credit facilities  proceeds from the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in december  proceeds from the issuance of million of nexstar holdings notes  the payment of nexstar s preferred membership interests of million  the repayment of quorum s senior discount notes of million  the repayment of quorum s series a preferred membership interests of million  the repayment of quorum s promissory notes issued to redeem common units of million  the repayment of vhr s note payable to related party of million  the payment of transaction and debt financing costs of approximately million  the net proceeds of million from the initial public equity offering and a million tax distribution to holders of preferred equity interests 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unused commitments under nexstar s and mission s senior credit facilities 
we and mission believe that we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the publicly held notes at december  future sources of liquidity and cash requirements we believe that the company s existing cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet the future cash requirements and obligations described below 
the company s ability to meet the future cash requirements described below depends on its ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general 
table of contents economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
we believe that cash generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under the nexstar and mission credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s debt service and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that the company s capital expenditures and acquisitions will be financed through cash flow generated from the company s operations and borrowings on available credit facilities 
in order to meet future cash needs nexstar may  from time to time  borrow under credit facilities or issue other long or short term debt or equity  if the market and the terms of existing nexstar debt arrangements permit  and mission may  from time to time  borrow under its available credit facilities 
we will continue to evaluate the best use of nexstar s operating cash flow among its capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt reduction 
the nexstar and mission credit facilities do not allow for the payment of cash dividends  therefore  nexstar and mission have not declared or paid a cash dividend and the payment of cash dividends is not anticipated in the foreseeable future 
future sources of financing and debt service requirements as of december   nexstar and mission had total combined debt of million  which represented of nexstar and mission s combined capitalization 
our and mission s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature for the periods referenced as of december total thereafter in thousands nexstar senior credit facility mission senior credit facility senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due senior discount notes due the terms of the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future 
the bank credit facility agreements and the fixed rate senior notes described below contain various restrictive covenants which require nexstar and mission to comply with certain financial ratios  capital expenditure limits  cash payments for broadcast rights limits and other restrictions 
the covenants  which are formally calculated on a quarterly basis  are based on the combined results of nexstar broadcasting and mission 
we do not foresee any difficulty in the company continuing to comply with the restrictions and covenants of the nexstar and mission credit facilities or the notes issued by nexstar 
we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to  new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities

hedge accounting resulting in an adjustment on the balance sheet of million 
the sfas no 
adjustment is being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period originally covered by the swap contract 
until december   we had in effect an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed interest rate and receive a variable interest rate as required by our bank credit facility agreement  with a notional amount of million 
this interest rate swap agreement expired on december  as the successor to quorum  we had entered into an interest rate collar agreement for a notional amount of million through september  and million from september  through december  under the agreement the ceiling and floor interest rates were and  respectively 
this agreement was terminated on april  future cash requirements for digital television dtv conversion dtv conversion it will be expensive to convert our and mission s stations from the current analog format to the digital broadcast format 
this conversion required an average initial capital expenditure of approximately million per station for low power transmission of digital signal programming 
except for wfxv  wqrf and knwa formerly kfaa  all of the television stations we and mission own and operate or provide services to are broadcasting at least a low power digital television signal 
digital conversion expenditures were million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and full power dtv facilities construction we estimate that it will require an average capital expenditure of approximately million per station for stations to modify our and mission s stations dtv transmitters for full power digital signal transmission  including costs for the transmitter  transmission line  antenna and installation  and estimated costs for tower upgrades and or modifications 
we anticipate these expenditures will be funded through available cash on hand and cash generated from operations as incurred in future years 
stations that fail to meet the fcc s build out deadlines will lose interference protection for their signals outside the low power coverage area 
as of december   only mission s stations wutr and wtvo were transmitting a full power digital signal 
other new dtv requirements the fcc also adopted new program system and information protocol psip requirements 
all dtv stations were required to comply with the new psip requirements by february  we and mission requested a short extension of time from the fcc to comply with the new psip requirements due to vendor delivery issues 
the installation of the equipment necessary to meet the new psip requirements cost approximately million in total for our stations and the stations to which we provide services 
these expenditures were funded in through available cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
no off balance sheet arrangements at december    and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our arrangements with mission and kfta knwa formerly kpom kfaa are on balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  broadcast rights  trade and barter  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for an overview of our significant accounting policies  we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the presentation of our financial statements  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions  and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management 
consolidation of mission and variable interest entities our financial statements include the accounts of independently owned mission and certain other entities where it has been determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation on accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
as revised in december fin no 
r 
under us gaap a company must consolidate an entity when it has a controlling financial interest resulting from ownership of a majority of the entity s voting rights 
fin no 
r expands the definition of controlling financial interest to include factors other than equity ownership and voting rights 
in applying fin no 
r  we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we are absorbing a majority of the entity s economic risks or receiving a majority of the entities economic rewards 
our evaluation of the risks and rewards model must be an ongoing process and may alter as facts and circumstances change 
mission is included in our consolidated financial statements because we believe we have a controlling financial interest in mission as a result of local service agreements we have with each of mission s stations  our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  and purchase options granted by mission s shareholder which will permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
in addition  generally in connection with acquisitions  the company enters into time brokerage agreements tba and begins operating a station before receiving fcc consent to the transfer of the station s ownership and broadcast license 
we include a station operated under a tba in our consolidated financial statements because we believe that we have a controlling financial interest in the station as a result of the company assuming the credit risk of advertising revenue it sold on the station and the company paying for substantially all the station s reasonable operating expenses  as required under the agreement 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  upon entering into the tba it is considered probable that the fcc will consent to the sale of the station and transfer of the station s broadcast license within a reasonable period of time 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
we  with assistance from our independent appraisers  determine the value of network affiliation agreements using a discounted cash flows valuation method assuming a hypothetical start up station whose only intangible asset is the network affiliation agreement 
for valuation purposes  we and our independent appraisers have determined that the cash flows associated with the network affiliation agreements should not be limited to the cash flows from the contractual period but should also incorporate assumptions such as future contract renewals 
accordingly  the estimated useful lives of such network affiliations also contemplates renewal of the underlying agreements 
we  with assistance from our independent appraisers  determine the value of broadcast licenses fcc licenses using a discounted cash flow valuation method assuming a hypothetical start up station whose only intangible asset is the fcc license 
we believe that our fcc licenses have an indefinite life based on our historical ability to renew such licenses  that such renewals may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost  and that the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor  such as the loss of a network affiliation or an adverse change in the advertising marketplace  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a market by market basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method that excludes network compensation payments 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the combined stations in a market reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings method 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our business plans 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the reporting unit s fair value as determined in step as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
nexstar and mission completed the annual test of impairment for goodwill and fcc licenses as of december  and these tests resulted in no impairment being recognized in and as of january  a transitional test was performed as required by sfas no 
nexstar and mission recognized an impairment loss of million  net of taxes  which was accounted for as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of in  our reporting units were revised to be the combined stations in a market as opposed to the individual station  which was used in prior years 
our decision to revise the reporting units is a result of our increasing focus on the market  including internal financial reporting  instead of the station  and the proportion of markets in which we own or provide services to more than one station 
for the markets in which we own or provide services to more than one station  the effect of the local service agreements is to consolidate two or more stations operations incorporating the sharing of assets within the market 
we believe our revision to the reporting units is consistent with our current perspective of our operations 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of long lived assets  including tangible and intangible assets  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is recognized when the expected future operating cash flow derived from the asset is less than its carrying value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts were million at both december  and 
table of contents broadcast rights carrying amount broadcast rights are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
cash broadcast rights  primarily in the form of syndicated programs and feature movie packages  are initially recorded at the amount paid or payable to program distributors for the limited right to broadcast the distributors programming and are recorded when available for use 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at our estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the programming received 
the value of the advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods 
amortization is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or usage  whichever yields the greater expense 
the current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for broadcast which will be amortized in the succeeding year 
if the expected broadcast period was shortened or cancelled due  for example  to poor ratings  we would be required to write off the remaining value of the related broadcast rights to operations on an accelerated basis or possibly immediately 
as of december   the amounts of current broadcast rights and non current broadcast rights were million and million  respectively 
trade and barter transactions we trade certain advertising time for various goods  services and programming 
these transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received 
we barter advertising time for certain program material 
these transactions  except those involving exchange of advertising time for network programming  are recorded at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the value of advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods 
we recorded barter revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trade revenue of million  million and million was recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred trade and barter expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
derivatives all of our interest rate swap and collar agreements were terminated or expired through as of december   we held no derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading  such as for hedging long term variable rate debt to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  as dictated by our credit agreement and for hedging fair value changes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate on fixed rate debt 
all derivatives are recognized on our balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction  based on criteria established by fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended 
we assess  both at its inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings 
if we determine that a cash flow hedge is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction  and any unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings 
the change in market values of derivative instruments and the marking to market of those interest rate swap agreements resulted in recognition of million and million in other income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in market values was due to a fluctuation in market interest rates 
the termination of the swap agreement on december  resulted in the recognition of million in other income for the year ended december  claims and loss contingencies in the normal course of business  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings 
we record a liability for these matters when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated 
we consider a combination of factors when estimating probable losses  including judgements about potential actions by counter parties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
all borrowings at december  under the senior credit facilities bear interest ranging from to  which represents the base rate  or libor  plus the applicable margin  as defined 
interest is payable in accordance with the credit agreements 
the following table estimates the changes to cash flow from operations as of december  if interest rates were to fluctuate by or basis points  or bps where basis points represents one percentage point  for a twelve month period after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement described below interest rate decrease no change to interest rate interest rate increase bps bps bps bps in thousands senior credit facilities senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due senior discount notes due total there is no change to our cash flow from operations associated with our senior subordinated and senior discount notes because these are fixed rate debt obligations 
as of december   we have no financial instruments in place to hedge against changes in the benchmark interest rates on this fixed rate debt 
we use derivative instruments to manage our exposures to interest rate risks 
our objective for holding derivatives is to minimize these risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
we used interest rate swap arrangements  not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
 in connection with our variable rate senior credit facilities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
giving effect to this interest rate swap agreement which was in effect at december   as of that date  we estimate that our cash flows from operations would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  for a bps and bps interest rate decrease  and decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  for a bps and bps interest rate increase 
until december   the company had in effect an interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank  with a notional amount of million 
this interest rate swap agreement required payment of a fixed rate and receive a floating rate thereby creating fixed rate debt 
the differential paid or received on the swap was accrued as an adjustment to interest expense 
the company was exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty 
the net fair value of the interest rate swap agreement  which represents the cash that the company would pay to settle the agreement  was approximately million at december  the interest rate swap agreement expired on december  additionally  the company was party to an interest rate collar agreement for a notional amount of million through december  under this agreement  the ceiling and floor interest rates were and  respectively 
the agreement was terminated on april  with no gain or loss recognized 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not affected by moderate changes in the inflation rate
