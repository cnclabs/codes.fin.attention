asset management segment business segment overview we operate an asset management business through our subsidiary deephaven capital management llc deephaven 
deephaven is the investment manager and sponsor of certain hedge funds the deephaven funds 
generally  hedge funds are defined as unregulated investment pools that may invest in any asset class  including derivatives  and use long and short positions  as well as leverage in order to generate returns for investors 
a distinguishing feature of hedge funds is their use of long or short positions to offset market risks and isolate arbitrage opportunities 
below is a summary of our assets under management at december   and  respectively and our blended fund returns for the years then ended year end assets under management billions annual fund return to investors annual fund return represents the blended annual return across all assets under management in the deephaven funds

as of december   one institutional investor accounted for more than of the deephaven funds assets under management  accounting for of such assets 
currently  the majority of the deephaven funds assets under management are in the deephaven market neutral master fund market neutral fund 
the investment philosophy for the market neutral fund is to produce returns for its investors using market neutral investment strategies focusing on the preservation of capital 
the general objective of market neutral strategies is to capture mispricings or spreads between related capital instruments 
because the primary basis of the market neutral fund s strategy is capturing mispricings or spreads between related instruments  rather than attempting to predict or follow absolute price movements  the performance of the market neutral fund is expected to be substantially non correlated with the general debt and equity markets  as well as with a number of other non traditional investment strategies 
its returns are primarily dependent upon equity trading volumes  equity volatility  mergers and acquisitions and secondary offering activity in the capital markets  and credit spread relationships 
within the market neutral fund  deephaven employs a variety of market neutral investment strategies  including convertible arbitrage  event arbitrage  relative value equity and distressed debt 
as of the end of  the majority of the assets within the market neutral fund were invested within global convertible arbitrage approximately  relative value equity approximately  global event arbitrage approximately and distressed debt and credit arbitrage approximately strategies 
as of december   the market neutral fund had approximately billion in assets under management 
in the first quarter of  deephaven launched a new single strategy fund  the deephaven long short equity fund long short fund 
the long short fund s objective is to generate superior risk adjusted rates of return by investing  both long and short  in equity securities of companies located around the world operating in a wide range of industries 
by employing fundamental analysis using quantitative and qualitative factors  the long short fund s strategy is designed to identify those stocks which are likely to increase or decrease in price over the near to medium term 
as of december   the long short fund had approximately million in assets under management 
in the second quarter of  deephaven launched another new single strategy fund  the deephaven event arbitrage fund event arb fund 
the investment strategy of the event arb fund is risk or merger arbitrage 
it invests in situations involving mergers  tender offers  exchange offers and other transactions in which one company is attempting to acquire another 
the event arb fund will also invest in situations in which a single company is undertaking a major reorganization  liquidation or spin off 
the arbitrage aspects of the strategy involve an assessment of the likelihood that the transaction will  in fact  be consummated and the resulting determination of how large an exposure to acquire as well as how and when to hedge such exposure 
as of december   the event arb fund held approximately million in assets under management 
in order to offer additional product choices for its client base  deephaven may  in the future  look to increase the number of single strategy funds it manages 
deephaven expects to launch another new fund  the deephaven credit opportunities fund in deephaven is also increasing the allocation of its assets under management invested in europe and asia 
asset management competition deephaven competes primarily with other asset management companies that manage and sponsor market neutral  long short equity and event arbitrage portfolios 
as deephaven launches new single strategy funds  such as the deephaven credit opportunities fund  it will compete with other asset management companies with similar investment strategies 
competition is primarily based on reputation  client relationships  the experience and stability of the management team  investment strategies  leverage  risk profile  fee structures and historical fund returns 

table of contents there is a growing trend among fund management companies and institutions to allocate more of their assets to hedge fund investments 
this has influenced the growth of the hedge fund industry  as shown in the table below 
the continued growth of the hedge fund industry may provide for greater competition in the future 
estimated number of hedge funds estimated total assets under management millions source hedge fund research  inc industry report asset management technology in the management of the deephaven funds  asset management uses both an in house developed proprietary order management system and a third party portfolio management system

equity markets segment business segment overview domestic equity markets operations we are a leading execution specialist providing comprehensive trade execution services to institutional and broker dealer clients  offering capital commitment and access to a deep pool of liquidity across the depth and breadth of the us equity markets 
our business model focuses on providing comprehensive trade execution services as well as superior client service 
to do so  the model requires that we manage risk effectively as well as maintain efficient and reliable trading technology 
substantially all of our equity markets revenues and profitability come from our equity trading and market making operations in the us generally  market makers display the prices at which they are willing to bid  meaning buy  or offer  meaning sell  securities and adjust their bid and offer prices in response to the forces of supply and demand for each security 
as a market maker operating in nasdaq  the nasdaq intermarket  the over the counter otc market for new york stock exchange nyse and american stock exchange amex listed securities  and the otc bulletin board  we provide trade executions by offering to buy securities from  or sell securities to  institutions and broker dealers

clients and product offerings within equity markets  we offer products and provide services to two main client groups broker dealers and institutions 
our marketing strategy for our equity markets segment is to continue to differentiate ourselves from competitors by providing high quality and competitive trade execution services with superior client service 
based on our internal allocation methodologies  our broker dealer clients and institutional clients which include our soft dollar and commission recapture clients each generated approximately half of our equity markets revenues in broker dealer clients our broker dealer clients primarily include global  national and regional broker dealers and on line brokers 
the majority of our equity order flow comes from providing market making and execution services to our broker dealer clients 
we seek to provide broker dealers with quality and competitive trade executions that enable them to satisfy their fiduciary duties to their customers to seek and obtain the best execution reasonably available in the marketplace 
we execute the majority of the order flow from broker dealer clients as principal 
the majority of the revenues we earn from broker dealer clients are net trading revenues  generated from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold 
we make payments to certain broker dealers in return for them routing order flow to us 
we have adjusted our payment for order flow rates several times over the past three years to better reflect the value of our liquidity 
in  our largest broker dealer client accounted for approximately of the company s us equity dollar value traded 
no other client accounted for over of our us equity dollar value traded 
institutional clients our institutional clients primarily include mutual funds  pension plans  plan sponsors  hedge funds  trusts and endowments 
we seek to provide institutions with high quality and competitive trade executions  superior client service and a wide range of product offerings 
over the past three years  we have worked to aggressively expand our institutional business and offerings 
as a result  we hired additional senior sales traders  opened regional offices in san francisco and chicago in and expanded our jersey city  london and boston offices in at the end of  we employed institutional sales professionals  up from at the end of knight offers institutions comprehensive  unbundled trade execution services covering the depth and breadth of the market 
we handle large  complex trades accessing liquidity from our order flow as well as that of other sources 
when liquidity is not naturally present in the market  we often commit our own capital to complete our clients trades 
our institutional product offerings include trade execution services  listed block trading  program trading  international equities  special situations risk arbitrage  soft dollar and commission recapture programs and corporate services 
the majority of our revenues from institutional clients are commissions on agency transactions or commission equivalents on riskless principal transactions 

table of contents in an effort to strengthen our product offerings to our institutional clients  on december   we acquired the business of donaldson co  incorporated donaldson  an atlanta based firm that offers soft dollar and commission recapture programs to institutions 
we earn agency commissions for providing soft dollar and commission recapture services 
equity markets competition equity trading and market making is constantly evolving and intensely competitive  a trend that we expect will continue 
our market making product competes primarily with similar products offered by global  national  and regional broker dealers  the nyse  the amex  regional exchanges and alternative trading venues  such as electronic communications networks commonly referred to as ecns 
in addition  we have experienced greater competition from market making firms with highly automated  electronic trading models 
another source of competition comes from broker dealers who execute portions of their client flow through internal market making desks rather than sending the flow to third party execution destinations  such as knight 
we compete primarily on the basis of our execution standards including price  liquidity and speed  client relationships  client service offerings and technology 
over the past several years  regulatory changes  competition and the continued focus by investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs  have resulted in a market environment characterized by narrowed spreads and reductions in revenue capture metrics 
consequently  maintaining profitability has become extremely difficult for many market makers 
generally  improvements in execution quality  such as faster execution speed and greater price improvement  negatively impact the ability to derive revenues from executing broker dealer order flow 
for example  we now voluntarily display certain eligible limit orders in otc bulletin board securities which could have a material impact on our profitability in these securities 
to remain profitable  some market makers have limited or ceased activity in illiquid or marginally profitable securities or  conversely  have sought to execute a greater volume of trades at a lower cost by increasing the automation and efficiency of their operations 
in addition  over the past few years  competition for order flow in the us equity markets has intensified due to the implementation of the sec rules ac and ac these rules  applicable to broker dealers  add greater disclosure to execution quality and order routing practices 
rule ac requires market centers that trade national market system securities to make available to the public monthly electronic reports that include uniform statistical measures of execution quality on a security by security basis 
rule ac requires broker dealers that route equity and option orders on behalf of their customers to make publicly available quarterly reports that describe their order routing practices and disclose the venues to which customer orders are routed for execution 
these statistics on execution quality vary by order sender based on their mix of business 
this rule also requires the disclosure of payment for order flow arrangements as well as internalization practices 
the intent of this rule is to encourage routing of order flow to destinations based primarily on the demonstrable quality of executions at those destinations  supported by the order entry firms fiduciary requirement to seek to obtain best execution for their customers orders 
commission rates have been under pressure for a number of years  and the ability to execute trades electronically through the internet and through other alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading commissions 
it appears that this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue 
we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices 
competition for business from institutional clients is based on a variety of factors  including equity research  execution quality  reputation  soft dollar and commission recapture services  technology  client relationships  and service and capital commitment 
based on industry surveys  over of institutional equity commissions have historically been allocated to broker dealers in exchange for either research or soft dollar and commission recapture services 
these industry surveys also indicate that execution quality is one of the primary reasons why institutions allocate commissions to broker dealers other than for research or soft dollar and commission recapture services 
we have not  and do not  provide research services 
with our acquisition of the business of donaldson  we strengthened the soft dollar and commission recapture 
table of contents services we provide to our clients 
in the future  due partly to the regulatory scrutiny over the past few years relating to equity research and the continued focus by investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs  we believe that a greater percentage of institutional commissions will be allocated based on the quality of executions 
however  there is no guarantee that this will occur 
equity markets technology we have invested a significant amount of resources in order to expand our execution capacity and upgrade our trading systems and infrastructure and plan to continue to make additional investments in technology in our ability to identify and deploy emerging technologies that facilitate the execution of trades is key to the successful execution of our business model 
not only has technology enhanced our capacity and ability to handle order flow faster  it has also been an important component of our strategy to comply with government regulations  achieve competitive execution standards  increase trading automation and provide superior client service 
in order to improve our efficiency and lower costs  we have automated a portion of our execution services through our internally developed quantitative models 
we plan to increase our use of technology and quantitative models to further automate our execution services 
we use our proprietary technology and technology licensed from third parties to execute trades  monitor the performance of our traders  assess our inventory positions  manage risk effectively and provide ongoing information to our clients 
we are electronically linked to institutions and broker dealers  to provide immediate access to our trading operations and to facilitate the handling of client orders 
in addition  our business to business portal provides our clients with an array of web based tools to interact with our equity markets trading systems 
broker dealers  both foreign and domestic  use this portal to send us order flow  access reports and use the other tools it offers to facilitate their business 
within equity markets  we use a customized version of the brass trading system originally built by sungard trading systems for otc equities 
for listed equities  we use a customized version of the appletree trading system originally built by tcam systems  inc we also use an internally developed integrated institutional sales technology platform  which consists of an order management system for the entry  management and routing of institutional orders  a system for the simultaneous distribution of indications of interest and trade advertisements to various sources  and a rules based trade allocation matching engine to receive allocation instructions from clients and automate post trade processing 
alternative trading facilities are in place for our domestic equity markets operations in westchester county  new york 
this facility has been designed to allow us to substantially continue operations if we are prevented from accessing or utilizing our primary office locations for an extended period of time 
corporate segment overview the corporate segment includes all costs not associated with our two primary operating segments  primarily corporate overhead expenses 
corporate overhead expenses primarily consist of compensation for certain senior executives and other individuals employed at the corporate holding company  legal and other professional expenses relating to corporate matters  investor and public relations expenses and directors and officers insurance 
this segment also includes the investment income earned on our strategic investments and our corporate investment in the deephaven funds 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights our success and ability to compete are dependent to a degree on our intellectual property  which includes our proprietary technology  trade secrets and client base 
we rely primarily on trade secret  trademark  domain name  patent and contract law to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  it is our policy to enter into 
table of contents confidentiality  intellectual property ownership and or non competition agreements with our employees upon commencement of employment  independent contractors and business partners  and to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property 
government regulation and market structure most aspects of the company s business are subject to extensive securities regulation under federal  state and applicable international laws 
in addition  the sec  the nasd  other self regulatory organizations commonly known as sros  and other regulatory bodies  such as state securities commissions  promulgate numerous rules and regulations 
as a matter of public policy  regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors in those markets 
broker dealers  such as kem and kcm  are subject to regulations concerning all aspects of their business  including trade practices  best execution practices  capital structure  record retention and the conduct of its officers  supervisors and registered employees 
failure to comply with any of these laws  rules or regulations could result in administrative or court proceedings  censures  fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  or the suspension or disqualification of the broker dealer and or its officers  supervisors or registered employees 
we  and certain of our officers and other employees  have in the past been subject to claims alleging the violation of such laws  rules and regulations  which resulted in the payment of fines and settlements 
currently  we are subject to several of these matters as further described in legal proceedings in part i  item herein 
in addition  aspects of the company s public disclosure  corporate governance principles  internal control environment and the roles of auditors and counsel are subject to the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations and rules of the sec and the nasdaq stock market  inc significant legislation  rule making and market structure changes have occurred over the last few years that have had an impact on the company and its business segments 
the introduction of decimalization  combined with the one penny minimum price spread  has caused a dramatic reduction in average spreads  which in turn has had a profound effect on our equity markets profitability 
subsequent rule making by the sec and nasd  and corresponding market structure changes  have had similar effects on the company and its business segments 
in addition  legislation such as the usa patriot act of imposed significant new obligations on broker dealers and mutual funds to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity  including standards for verifying client identification at account opening  and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities 
the increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers  watch for and report suspicious transactions  respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  and share information with other financial institutions  requires the implementation and maintenance of internal practices  procedures and controls which have increased our costs and may subject us to regulatory inquiries  claims or penalties 
the regulatory environment in which we operate our equity markets business segment is subject to constant change 
our business  financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the us congress  the sec  other united states or foreign governmental regulatory authorities  the nasd  and other sros or regulatory bodies 
additional regulations  changes in existing laws and rules  or changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of regulated broker dealers 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  such changes might have 
for example  the sec recently re proposed rules under its regulation nms designed to modernize and strengthen the regulatory structure of the us equity markets 
although many components of regulation nms will strengthen our national market system  certain components of the proposal ie  the trade through rule may have the potential for causing greater harm than good to the marketplace 
depending on the final outcome  it is possible that regulation nms  and its associated rules  could negatively impact our equity markets business 
we have london based subsidiaries 
the brokerage industry in many foreign countries  like the us  is heavily regulated 
the varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to conduct business or expand internationally 

table of contents our asset management subsidiary  deephaven  is a private asset management company that is not registered as an investment adviser and  as such  is subject to limited regulatory oversight by the sec 
although deephaven is not registered as an investment adviser  it is subject to the anti fraud provisions of the investment advisers act of  including section 
deephaven is registered with the commodity futures trading commission cftc and is a member of the national futures association nfa as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading adviser 
due to the nature of deephaven s client base  however  deephaven is exempt from many of the cftc nfa regulations 
the sec has enacted new rules that require most hedge funds  including deephaven  to register as investment advisors by february  this will result in additional responsibilities and obligations on deephaven s business 
the company believes that it is in material compliance with applicable regulations 
net capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the sec s net capital rule 
this rule  which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered broker dealers  is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker dealer and requires that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form 
in general  net capital is defined as net worth assets minus liabilities  plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and certain discretionary liabilities  and less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from valuing conservatively certain other assets 
among these deductions are adjustments  commonly called haircuts  which reflect the possibility of a decline in the market value of an asset before disposition  and non allowable assets 
failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec  and suspension or expulsion by the nasd and other regulatory bodies  and ultimately could require the firm s liquidation 
the net capital rule prohibits payments of dividends  redemption of stock  the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder  employee or affiliate  if such payment would reduce the firm s net capital below required levels 
a change in the net capital rule  the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit those operations that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our broker dealer subsidiaries 
a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business 
additionally  certain of our foreign subsidiaries in london are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the financial services authority in the united kingdom 
during  we were in compliance with our capital adequacy requirements
