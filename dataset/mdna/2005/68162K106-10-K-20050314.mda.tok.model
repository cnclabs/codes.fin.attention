item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors  such as general and global business  economic and political conditions  competition  steel pricing and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of steel  customer demand for steel and customers ability to manage their credit line availability in an escalated price market and layoffs or work stoppages by suppliers or customers personnel 
we sell a broad range of steel products  many of which have different gross profits and margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit and higher margins 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by product mix  the amount of processing performed  the availability of steel  volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by our detroit and georgia operations 
our two joint ventures are olympic laser processing  llc olp  a company that processes laser welded sheet steel blanks for the automotive industry  and gsp  llc gsp  a certified minority business enterprise company supporting the flat rolled steel requirements of the automotive industry 
our interest in olp and interest in gsp are accounted for under the equity method 
financing costs include interest expense on debt and deferred financing and bank amendment fees amortized to expense 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in puerto rico and mexico 
all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars 
recent international sales have been immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
in  we closed our unprofitable tube processing operation tubing in cleveland  ohio 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  tubing has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and its assets were written down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the carrying value of the tubing real estate was recorded as assets held for sale on the accompanying balance sheets and the carrying value of  was reduced to a balance of  to reflect the contractual sales price of the property 
the sale was completed in the third quarter of the  reduction in carrying value is recorded as an asset impairment charge on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the collective bargaining agreement covering hourly plant employees at our detroit facility expires june  a collective bargaining agreement for employees at our minneapolis coil facility expires on september   whereas agreements covering other detroit and minneapolis employees expire in and subsequent years 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good 
however  any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon a calculated percentage of accounts receivable  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to 
table of contents year 
we can not be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased steel  internal and external processing  and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
during  we generated sufficient income to utilize substantially all of the operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when steel is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is transferred which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  virtually all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk our business was impacted by decreasing volumes and fluctuating prices starting in the second half of and continuing through the third quarter of  due to softening demand from customers in the manufacturing sector of the us economy and domestic steel mill consolidation 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  we experienced an increase in demand and prices for our products 
during  steel producers were significantly impacted by a shortage of raw materials  rising raw material prices  increased product demand  producer consolidation and longer lead time requirements 
these conditions resulted in unprecedented cost increases and 
table of contents translated into higher gross profit dollars and margins 
while market prices declined in the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of  we anticipate prices to remain higher than historical levels in during  we were able to pass on to our customers producers price increases and surcharges 
the recent decline in steel prices has reduced our gross profit margin percentages to levels which are lower than our historical levels  however  the gross margin dollars generated per ton remains at historically high levels 
we are unable to predict the duration of the current upturn in the economic cycle beyond the immediate future 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuating steel prices 
we have not entered into any interest rate or steel commodity hedge transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy  and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
when raw material prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the steel price increases can be passed on to our customers 
when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower costed product result in lower selling prices 
declining steel prices have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income over the two years prior to while increasing steel prices favorably affected net sales and net income in our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt 
if interest rates in the future were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in total debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to us would be approximately thousand 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to variable interest rate risk 
however  we have the option to enter into to day fixed base rate euro loans under the credit facility
