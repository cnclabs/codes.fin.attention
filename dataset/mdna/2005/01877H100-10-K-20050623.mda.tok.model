item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note private equity investments in the consolidated financial statements 
we review our share of the underlying assets of the companies in which we invest and if our investment is greater than the underlying assets  we generally allocate excess to goodwill as most of the investee companies are in their early formation stage 
we also perform an analysis on individual venture investee companies in accordance with fin consideration of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities vie to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the holders of the variable interest in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance it s activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
as of march   we had one investee company which would qualify as a vie and for which we were the primary beneficiary 
the impact of consolidation of this vie was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
the investment company act of following a special study after the stock market crash of and the ensuing depression  congress enacted the investment company act of the act 
the act was primarily meant to regulate investment companies  which generally include families of mutual funds of the type offered by the fidelity and vanguard organizations to pick two of many  closed end investment companies that are traded on the public stock markets  and certain non managed pooled investment vehicles such as unit investment trusts 
in those cases  the entities in question describe themselves as being in the business of investing  reinvesting and trading in securities and generally own relatively diversified portfolios of publicly traded securities that are issued by companies not controlled by these entities 
the fundamental intent of the act is to protect the interests of public investors from fraud and manipulation by the people who establish and operate investment companies  which constitute large pools of liquid assets that could be used improperly  or not be properly safeguarded  by the persons in control of them 
when the act was written  its drafters and congress concluded that a company could  either deliberately or inadvertently  come to have the defining characteristics of an investment company within the meaning of the act without proclaiming that fact or being willing to voluntarily submit itself to regulation as an acknowledged investment company  and that investors in such a company could be just as much in need of protection as are investors in companies that are openly and deliberately established as investment companies 
in order to deal with this perceived potential need to provide additional investor protection  the act and rules under it contain provisions and set forth principles that are designed to differentiate true operating companies from companies that may be considered to have sufficient investment company like characteristics to require regulation by the act s complex procedural and substantive requirements 
these provisions apply to companies that own or hold securities  as well as companies that invest  reinvest and trade in securities  and particularly focus on determining the primary nature of a company s activities  including whether an investing company controls and does business through the entities in which it invests or  instead  holds its securities investments passively and not as part of an operating business 
for instance  under what is  for most purposes  the most liberal of the relevant tests  a company may become subject to the act s registration requirements if it  on an unconsolidated basis  either holds more than of its non cash assets in  or derives more than of its income from  investments in companies that the investor does not primarily control or through which it 
table of contents does not actively do business 
in making these determinations the act generally requires that a company s assets be valued on a current fair market value basis  determined on the basis of securities public trading price or  in the case of illiquid securities and other assets  in good faith by our board of directors 
we made our investments in chartered  umc and tower as operating investments primarily intended to secure adequate wafer manufacturing capacity and other strategic goals 
because of the appreciation in value of certain of our investments  including our strategic wafer manufacturing investments  we could be viewed as holding a larger portion of our assets in investment securities than is presumptively permitted by the act for a company that is not registered under it 
on the other hand  we believe that the investments that we currently hold in umc and tower  and previously held in chartered  even though in companies that we do not control  are properly regarded as strategic deployments of our assets for the purpose of furthering our integrated circuit business  rather than as the kind of financial investments that generally are considered to constitute investment securities 
applying certain other tests that the securities and exchange commission sec utilizes in determining investment company status  we have never held ourselves out as an investment company  our historical development has focused almost exclusively on the integrated circuit business  the activities of our officers and employees have been overwhelmingly addressed to achieving success in the integrated circuit business  and prior to the past few years  our income and losses have been derived almost exclusively from the integrated circuit business 
accordingly  we believe that we are properly regarded as being primarily engaged in a business other than investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities 
we believe that we could be viewed as holding a larger portion of the assets in investment securities than is presumptively permitted by the act for a company that is not registered under the act 
in august  we applied to the sec for an order under section b of the act confirming the non investment company status 
in march  the staff of the sec informed us that the staff could not support the granting of the requested exemption 
since that time  we have been working to resolve the status under the act 
first  we have engaged in a routine process to sell certain of our assets that could be deemed to be investment securities for purposes of the act 
specifically  from april  through march   we sold over of our umc holdings 
as a result  together with market factors  the aggregate value of our umc holdings declined from million to million 
in addition  consistent with prevailing market conditions and the interests of our stockholders  we sold all of our holdings in adaptec  inc  chartered  magma design automation  broadcom corporation  pmc sierra corporation and vitesse semiconductor corporation 
we continue to work to reduce certain of our holdings  including umc  consistent with market factors  and the interests of our stockholders 
second  we have engaged in a systematic review of our existing holdings to identify those holdings that are viable candidates to become our controlled subsidiaries  which generally are not deemed investment securities 
for example  we acquired chip engines in january third  we have ceased acquiring interests in any new companies through alliance ventures 
we cannot be certain the sec will agree that we are not currently deemed to be an unregistered investment company in violation of the act 
if the sec takes the view that we have been operating and continue to operate as an unregistered investment company in violation of the act  and does not provide us with a sufficient period to register as an investment company or divest ourselves of investment securities and or acquire non investment securities  we may be subject to significant potential penalties 
in the absence of exemptions granted by the sec which are discretionary in nature and require the sec to make certain findings  we would be required either to register as a closed end investment company under the act  or  in the alternative  to divest ourselves of sufficient investment securities and or to acquire sufficient non investment assets so as not to be regarded as an investment company under the act 
if we elect to register as a closed end investment company under the act  a number of significant requirements will be imposed upon us 
these would include  but not be limited to  a requirement that at least of our board of directors not be interested persons of alliance semiconductor as defined in the act and that those directors be granted certain special rights with respect to the approval of certain kinds of transactions particularly those that pose a possibility of giving rise to conflicts of interest  prohibitions on the grant of stock options that would be outstanding for more than days and upon the use of stock for 
table of contents compensation which could be highly detrimental to us in view of the competitive circumstances in which we seek to attract and retain qualified employees  and broad prohibitions on affiliate transactions  such as the compensation arrangements applicable to the management of alliance venture management  many kinds of incentive compensation arrangements for management employees and joint investment by persons who control us in entities in which we are also investing which could require us to abandon or significantly restructure our management arrangements  particularly with respect to our investment activities 
while we could apply for individual exemptions from these restrictions  there could be no guarantee that such exemptions would be granted  or granted on terms that we would deem practical 
additionally  we would be required to report our financial results in a different form from that currently used by us  which would have the effect of turning our statement of operations upside down by requiring that we report our investment income and the results of our investment activities  instead of our operations  as our primary sources of revenue 
if we elect to divest ourselves of sufficient investment securities and or to acquire sufficient non investment assets so as not to be regarded as an investment company under the act  we would need to ensure that the value of investment securities excluding the value of us government securities and securities of certain majority owned subsidiaries does not exceed forty percent of our total assets excluding the value of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis 
in seeking to meet this requirement  we might choose to divest ourselves of assets that we consider strategically significant for the conduct of our operations or to acquire additional operating assets that would have a material effect on our operations 
there can be no assurance that we could identify such operating assets to acquire or could successfully acquire such assets 
any such acquisition could result in us issuing additional shares that may dilute the equity of our existing stockholders  and or result in us incurring additional indebtedness  which could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
were we to acquire any additional businesses  there would be the additional risk that our acquired and previously existing businesses could be disrupted while we attempted to integrate the acquired business  as well as risks associated with us attempting to manage a new business with which we were not familiar 
any of the above risks could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
employees as of march   we had full time employees  consisting of in research and development  in marketing  in sales  in administration and in operations 
of the research and development employees are in the us and are in india 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel  particularly highly skilled design engineers involved in new product development  for which competition is intense 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
we have recently experienced and may continue to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operating and financial systems  resulting in increased responsibilities for our management 
to manage future growth effectively  we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems and to hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able effectively to manage future growth  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of our founders  n 
damodar reddy  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president of alliance semiconductor  and his brother cn reddy  executive vice president for investments and director of alliance semiconductor collectively referred to as the reddys  as well as other officers and key design personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in the last few years  a number of officers and design personnel left us to pursue various other opportunities 
as a result of these departures  some projects have been delayed  however  these delays have not had a material impact on our business 
the future success of alliance semiconductor will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel  particularly highly skilled design engineers involved in new product development  for which competition is intense 
the loss of either of the reddys or key design personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise have a material 
table of contents adverse effect on our business 
we are not insured against the loss of any of our key employees  nor can we assure the successful recruitment of new and replacement personnel

item properties our executive offices and principal marketing  sales and administrative operations are located in a  square foot leased facility in santa clara  california under a lease which expires in july we have an option to extend the lease for a term of five years 
we also lease office space in hsin chu  taiwan to manage the logistics of the wafer fabrication  assembly and testing of our products manufactured in taiwan 
we lease one building to house our design center in bangalore  india and have purchased a parcel of land in an office park under development in hyderabad  india for product development 
we also lease a building in hyderabad  india to support our design center there 
this leased facility was acquired as part of our acquisition of chip engines 
additionally  we lease sales offices in natick  massachusetts  foothill ranch  california  bracknell  united kingdom  taipei  taiwan  tokyo  japan  and shenzhen  china 
we use all of our facilities for both reportable segments of our business except for the hyderabad design center which exclusively supports the non memory segment 
we believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our needs as a company and for each of our reportable segments 
item legal proceedings in july  we learned that a default judgment was entered against us in canada  in the amount of approximately million  in a case filed in captioned prabhakara chowdary balla and trittek research ltd 
v 
fitch research corporation  et al  british columbia supreme court no 
victoria registry 
as we had previously not participated in the case  we believe that we never were properly served with process in this action  and that the canadian court lacks jurisdiction over us in this matter 
in addition to jurisdictional and procedural arguments  we also believe we may have grounds to argue that the claims against us should be deemed discharged by our bankruptcy in in february  the court set aside the default judgment against us 
in april  the plaintiffs were granted leave by the court to appeal this judgment 
oral arguments were made before the court of appeals in june in july  the court of appeals instructed the lower court to allow the parties to take depositions regarding the issue of service of process 
in september  mr 
balla took the deposition of n 
damodar reddy  and our canadian counsel took the depositions of the plaintiff  mr 
balla  as well as of some witnesses who had submitted affidavits on behalf of the plaintiff 
in its july order  the court of appeals also set aside the default judgment against us 
the plaintiffs appealed the setting aside of the default judgment against us to the canadian supreme court 
in june  the canadian supreme court refused to hear the appeal of the setting aside of the default judgment against us 
we believe the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations 
from september   the british columbia supreme court heard mr 
balla s application to have the service deemed effective 
in november  the court issued a declaration that mr 
balla had complied with the order for substituted service and thus had effected service on alliance 
alliance has been granted leave to appeal this decision to the british columbia court of appeal and this appeal is currently underway 
that application is ongoing  and the court has not yet issued a ruling 
on december   alliance semiconductor and our then vice president of sales were sued in santa clara superior court by plaintiff segtec ltd  an israeli company and former sales representative of us 
in its complaint  segtec alleges that we terminated an oral sales agreement agreement and had failed to 
table of contents pay commissions due to segtec in an amount in excess of  segtec also alleges that our termination of the agreement was without cause and that we have materially breached the agreement  and certain other matters  including misappropriation of trade secrets 
plaintiff seeks compensatory  incidental  and consequential damages for the aforementioned allegations  punitive damages for the fraud allegations specifically  and payment for the value of services rendered 
plaintiff served the complaint on us and our former vice president of sales on december  plaintiff then served two amended complaints on march and on april  on may   the former vice president of sales was successfully dismissed from the lawsuit in his individual capacity  and the entire case against alliance was successfully ordered to arbitration before the american arbitration association to resolve the commission related dispute 
all remaining causes of action unrelated to the commission related dispute have been stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration proceedings 
no schedule for the arbitration proceedings has yet been set 
due to the early stage of the litigation  we cannot determine what  if any  effect resolution of this matter will have on our financial condition 
in july  we were named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against tower  certain of tower s directors including n 
damodar reddy  and certain of tower s stockholders including alliance semiconductor 
the lawsuit alleges that a proxy solicitation by tower seeking approval from the tower shareholders for a restructuring of a financing agreement between tower and certain investors including alliance contained false and misleading statements and or omitted material information in violations of section a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and rule a promulgated thereunder  and also alleges that certain defendants including n 
damodar reddy and alliance semiconductor have liability under section a of the exchange act 
the lawsuit was brought by plaintiffs on behalf of a putative class of persons who were ordinary stockholders of tower at the close of business on april   the record date for voting on certain matters proposed in a proxy statement issued by tower 
we have reviewed a copy of the complaint  believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend vigorously against the claims asserted against it 
due to the early stage of the litigation  we cannot determine what  if any  effect resolution of this matter will have on our financial condition 
on february   kenneth patrizio  one of our former employees of alliance semiconductor international corp  filed a complaint against us and anwar khan  our vice president of quality  for various employment related claims seeking unspecified damages 
the complaint was amended on may   alleging discrimination and other related violations 
the company and mr 
khan intend to vigorously defend the suit 
discovery has not begun  so at this early time it is impossible to predict whether the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable or remote 
in addition  we are party to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops  and markets high performance memory  analog and mixed signal  and systems solutions products 
we operate in two reportable segments memory segment and non memory segment 
the memory business unit primarily designs  manufactures and sells sram and dram devices 
sram and dram sales  which are characterized by intense price pressure and declining margins  have traditionally comprised the majority of our revenue 
this business unit contributed of our net revenue during fiscal in fiscal  we ceased developing new dram products 
currently dram product revenue is derived solely from supplying legacy dram products to existing customers 
as a result  we expect revenue from dram products to comprise a significantly smaller portion of overall revenue in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as well as on a quarter to quarter basis 
dram revenue decreased by in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and will eventually decline to our non memory segment aggregates two operating segments the analog and mixed signal business unit and the system solutions business unit 
our analog and mixed signal business unit designs  manufactures and sells products designed to provide analog and mixed signal solutions for the communications  computing  embedded  industrial and consumer markets 
the analog and mixed signal business unit has traditionally accounted for a 
table of contents small  but growing portion of our revenue 
net revenue from analog and mixed signal products comprised of our net revenue during fiscal and increased by  compared to fiscal our system solutions business unit designs  manufactures and sells products designed to accelerate the transmission and switching of data  video  and voice in high performance and bandwidth intensive networking  storage  and server markets 
the system solutions business unit has traditionally accounted for a small portion of our revenue 
during fiscal  net revenue from system solutions products comprised of our net revenue and decreased by less than  compared to fiscal discrete financial information for each reportable segment  including profit or loss and expenses  was not available prior to fiscal our net revenue for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net revenue in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was driven primarily by a million decrease in dram revenue offset by a million increase in analog and mixed signal revenue 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was driven by a million increase in memory net revenue and a million increase in systems solutions revenue 
revenue from our non memory business units comprised of net revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this is consistent with our strategy of diversifying our product portfolio to reduce our dependence on memory products which generally experience volatile demand and pricing and lower gross margins 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
our agreements with third party foundries do not include any guaranteed capacity or take or pay provisions 
as a result of our dependence on third party wafer foundries  principally chartered and tower  our ability to increase our unit sales volumes depends on our ability to increase our wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  add foundries and improve yields of die per wafer 
in the past  we have experienced constraints in the supply of wafers from certain of our foundries  however  we are not currently experiencing such constraints 
any such future constraints may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
in addition  we must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments 
there is a risk that we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular product due to volatile product demand  rapid technological and price change 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of our customers place orders with short lead times 
as a result  we had to record pretax inventory charges of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our sales are generally made when purchase orders are received from customers 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  we believe backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
international net revenue  principally from customers in europe and asia  constituted approximately of net revenue in fiscal all of our foundries and a majority of our assembly and test subcontractors are located abroad  and we have substantial operations in india 
as a result  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally including economic fluctuations  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws and  possibly  political instability 
additionally  we expect to expand our operations in india over the next several years  if possible 
we plan to invest in this operation to the extent that we have the resources to do so 
we hold equity interests in a number of other companies 
we acquired these interests for strategic reasons  such as developing a strong relationship with certain third party wafer foundries we rely on to manufacture our products 
during fiscal  we recorded a write down in our short and long term investment in tower ordinary shares of million and a write down of million on one of our alliance ventures and solar venture partners investee companies 
assets written down during fiscal and included our investments in alliance ventures management and solar venture partners funds as well as investments in marketable equity securities 
we also hold a large portion of our assets in shares of umc  a publicly traded company in taiwan 
as a majority of our assets are in marketable securities and venture investments  we run the risk that we will have to record additional write downs of these assets in the future based on market conditions 

table of contents because of the significant investments we have made in other businesses  we could be deemed to be an unregistered investment company in violation of the investment company act of the act 
in august  we applied to the sec for an order under section b of the act confirming our non investment company status 
in march  the staff of the sec informed us that the staff could not support the granting of the requested exemption 
since that time  we have been working to resolve our status under the act  principally through divestment of certain strategic investments  including a significant portion of our umc common stock 
during the third quarter of fiscal we also liquidated our investments in adaptec and vitesse common stock 
no assurances can be given that the sec will agree that we are not currently deemed to be an unregistered investment company in violation of the act 
if the sec takes the view that we have operated and continue to operate as an unregistered investment company in violation of the act  and does not provide us with a sufficient period to register as an investment company or divest ourselves of investment securities and or acquire non investment assets  we may be subject to significant potential penalties 
in an effort to comply with the act  we have divested ourselves of certain securities  ceased acquiring interests in any new companies through alliance ventures and taken certain additional actions 
during fiscal  we used cash of million for operations and investments 
this includes million for operations and purchases of licenses and equipment and million for investments in alliance ventures investee companies 
we sold umc  vitesse  and adaptec common stock shares for proceeds of million to finance these activities 
during  we repaid in full our million outstanding debt with chinatrust resulting in the release of million shares of umc common stock  which was held as collateral against the loan 
umc common stock share sales have been  and are expected to continue to be  our main source of liquidity in the near term 
there are no restrictions on our ability to sell our shares of umc common stock and none of our holdings is collateralized 
however  the value of our short term investments in marketable securities  especially our holdings in umc and tower  has declined substantially in value in recent quarters  and may continue to decline in value in the future 
although there is an actively traded market for umc common stock in taiwan  the shares are not traded in the united states and are subject to many of the same risks as foreign currency in addition to the risks of a company subject to the fluctuations of the semiconductor industry 
continued decreases in the value of our holdings in umc and tower may require us to liquidate our holdings faster than we anticipate and result in less cash available for our continued operations 
for example  as of march   a decrease in the share price of umc common stock would result in a million decrease in working capital 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and future cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  our business has used cash over the last several years and  to the extent we have the ability to do so  we plan to invest in our operations in india 
also  the value of our short term investments in marketable securities  especially our holdings in umc and tower  has declined substantially in value in recent quarters and  as we have a limited ability to sell these securities  they may continue to decline in value in the future 
additionally  we are currently the subject of an audit by the internal revenue service with respect to fiscal and tax years through for those years under review we received tax refunds of approximately million 
at this stage of the audit  the irs has informed us that there is a high likelihood that certain positions we have taken will be disallowed  however  we believe that it is too early to determine the impact on us of the resolution of this audit 
in order to finance general corporate needs  as well as strategic acquisitions and investments in research and development and other general corporate needs  we may rely on the debt and equity markets to provide liquidity 
historically  we have been able to access the debt and equity markets  but this does not necessarily guarantee that we will be able to access these markets in the future or on terms that are acceptable to us 
the availability of capital in these markets is affected by several factors  including geopolitical risk  the interest rate environment and the condition of the economy as a whole 
in addition  our own operating performance  capital structure and expected future performance may impact our ability to raise capital 
if our operating performance falls below expectations  if our short term investments in marketable securities continue to decrease in value or if there is an adverse determination with respect to the audit  we may have difficulties meeting our longer term cash needs 

table of contents our net loss was million  or per share for fiscal  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for fiscal and a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal critical accounting policies the sec has issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
in frr  the sec defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventory valuation  marketable securities  valuation of alliance ventures and solar investments  and revenue recognition 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
collection is not deemed to be reasonably assured if customers receive extended payment terms 
as we do not have any post sales obligations or customer acceptance criteria after shipment  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
we offer our customers a standard warranty for defective parts  and we record an allowance for warranty costs in the period in which the revenue is recorded 
we offer certain distributor rights of return in the form of stock rotation rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products purchased from us having value up to a contracted fixed percentage of the prior quarter s shipments to that distributor 
we have established reserves for warranty claims  rights of returns and allowances on product sales  which are recorded in the same period in which the related revenue is recorded 
these provisions are based on estimates using historical sales returns  warranty costs  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors  and these estimates are reviewed periodically to determine if recent actual data deviate from historical trends 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates then material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
actual returns could differ from these estimates 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventory  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory 
we determine excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand  we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which will decrease gross margin and net operating results in the future 
we recorded pretax  inventory charges of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
marketable securities marketable securities held by alliance semiconductor are valued at market prices with unrealized gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the balance sheet 
however  management evaluates our investment in marketable securities for potential other than temporary declines in value 
such evaluation includes researching commentary from industry experts  analysts and other companies  current and 
table of contents forecasted business conditions and any other information deemed necessary in the evaluation process 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax  non operating write down on our short term investment in tower ordinary shares of million based on decrease in the share price during the last two quarters of fiscal we also recorded a write down on our long term investment of tower ordinary shares of million 
we did not record any write downs in the fair value of our marketable securities during fiscal we recorded pretax  non operating write downs of  and million during the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
valuation of alliance ventures and solar venture investments we enter into certain equity investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
our policy is to value these investments at our historical cost 
in addition  our policy requires us to periodically review these investments for impairment 
for these investments  an impairment analysis requires significant judgment  including an assessment of the investees financial condition  viability and valuation of subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any contractual preferences  as well as the investees historical results  projected results and prospects for additional financing 
if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from our estimates  our recorded impairments may be understated  and we may incur additional charges in future periods 
as a result of management s analysis of our venture investments  we recorded pretax  non operating impairment charges related to alliance ventures of million  million and million fiscal  and  respectively 
we also recorded pretax  non operating impairment charges related to solar venture partners of   and million during fiscal  and  respectively

revenue generated by our system solutions business unit resulted primarily from products incorporating technology from a perpetual  royalty free api license purchased during fiscal the decrease in memory revenue resulted from a decrease in unit sales of combined with a decrease in average selling prices asps of 
our net revenue in fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal due to a increase in unit volume and a decrease in asps 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in memory product revenue 
our sram net revenue for fiscal was million  or approximately of net revenue  compared to million  or approximately of net revenue  in fiscal this represents a decrease of million  or  from fiscal  and resulted from an decrease in unit sales combined with a decrease in asps 
during fiscal  our megabits shipped decreased by  compared to fiscal  while our asp per megabit increased by resulting in an overall decrease in sram revenue of 
sram net revenue increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced higher unit volume shipments of higher density asynchronous sram products and initial volume shipments of synchronous sram products  both of which generally carry higher asps on a per unit basis than do lower density products 
lower density products comprised a greater percentage of unit shipments during fiscal as a result  our asp on a per unit basis increased in fiscal from fiscal during fiscal  our megabits shipped increased from fiscal and asps per megabit shipped decreased which resulted in an overall increase in sram revenue of

dram net revenue for fiscal was million  or approximately of net revenue 
in fiscal  we ceased developing new dram products 
currently dram product revenue is derived solely from supplying legacy dram products to existing customers 
our dram revenue will eventually decline to our analog and mixed signal net revenue for fiscal was million  or approximately of net revenue  compared to million  or approximately of net revenue in fiscal this represents an increase of approximately million in net revenue from fiscal and resulted from a increase in 
table of contents unit sales combined with a decrease in asps 
unit volumes tend to be greater in this business unit as the cpu supervisors product line generates relatively large unit volumes at relatively low asps 
analog and mixed signal net revenue for fiscal was million  or of net revenue 
our system solutions net revenue for fiscal was million  or approximately of net revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total revenue for fiscal revenue decreased by less than in fiscal compared to fiscal resulting from a increase in unit sales offset by a decrease in asps 
system solutions net revenue for fiscal was million  or of net revenue 
at march  net revenue by geographic location  which is based on the customer s ship to country location  was as follows in thousands us canada and central america taiwan japan hong kong asia excluding taiwan  japan and hong kong united kingdom europe excluding united kingdom rest of world net revenue for the years ended march  and  the geographic revenue is presented based on ship to country of customer to be consistent with presentation 
these amounts had been previously reported based upon bill to location of customer 
international net revenue in fiscal was million  or approximately of net revenue 
this was a decrease of approximately from fiscal international net revenue in fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal international net revenue is derived mainly from customers in asia and europe 
net revenue from asia accounted for approximately and europe accounted for of net revenue during fiscal our analog and mixed signal revenues comprised a larger percentage of net revenue in fiscal  compared to fiscal  with a large portion of the revenue attributed to products shipped to taiwan and the rest of the asia region 
generally  the markets for our products are characterized by volatile supply and demand conditions  numerous competitors  rapid technological change  and product obsolescence 
these conditions could require us to make significant shifts in our product mix in a relatively short period of time 
these changes involve several risks  including  among others  constraints or delays in timely deliveries of products from our suppliers  lower than anticipated wafer manufacturing yields  lower than expected throughput from assembly and test suppliers  and less than anticipated demand and reduced selling prices 
the occurrence of any problems resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
gross profit loss our gross loss for fiscal was million  or of net revenue 
our gross profit for fiscal was million and the gross loss for fiscal was million  which represents and of net revenue  respectively 
during fiscal our gross margin was benefited by million  or  through the sale of previously reserved inventory 
during fiscal  our gross margin was benefited by million  or  through the sale of previously reserved inventory 
we will continue to receive gross profit and gross margin benefits as we sell inventory which had been previously written down to a lower cost basis 
as of march   we have approximately million of memory products that have been written to we also incurred inventory write downs of million  million  and million during fiscal   and 
table of contents  respectively  as a result of a reduction in end user demand and severe downward pricing pressure for memory products 
no inventory write downs were recorded for non memory  analog and mixed signal or system solutions products  in fiscal at march  gross profit loss by reportable segments was as follows in thousands  except percentage data percentage change vs memory non memory gross profit loss the gross loss  excluding the impact of inventory write downs and sale of previously reserved products  was million  or of net revenue during fiscal this compares to a gross loss of million  or of net revenue  during fiscal and a gross loss of million or of net revenue  during fiscal this reduction in gross loss  excluding the impact of inventory write downs  is due to a product mix with increased volume in higher margin analog and mixed signal and system solutions products  along with a reduction in dram net revenue 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we began volume production of synchronous sram products and experienced lower than expected yields resulting in higher than anticipated costs for certain products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase yields to an acceptable level 
failure to do so could result in a material adverse effect on our gross profit in future periods 
during the third quarter of fiscal we wrote off million of prepaid wafer credits resulting from our investment in tower 
we had determined that the value of these credits would not be realized given our sales forecast of products scheduled to be manufactured at tower 
there can be no assurances that our investment in tower wafer credits will not continue to decline in value 
we are subject to a number of factors that may have an adverse impact on gross profit  including the availability and cost of products from our suppliers  increased competition and related decreases in unit  changes in the mix of product sold  and the timing of new product introductions and volume shipments 
in addition  we may seek to add foundry suppliers and transfer existing and newly developed products to more advanced manufacturing processes 
the commencement of manufacturing at a new foundry is often characterized by lower yields  as the manufacturing process needs to be refined 
there can be no assurance that the commencement of such manufacturing will not have a material adverse effect on our cost of revenue in future periods 
research and development at march  research and development r d expense as a percentage of net revenue was calculated as follows in thousands  except percentage data percentage change vs vs net revenue r d expense r d expense as a percentage of net revenue 
table of contents at march  r d expense by reportable segments was as follows in thousands  except percentage data percentage change vs memory non memory unallocable r d expense r d expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits for engineering design personnel  equipment and software depreciation and amortization  facilities costs  masks  tooling  prototype wafers and finished goods  equipment and software maintenance  consulting and other outside services and license fees 
r d expense was million  or of net revenue for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net revenue for fiscal and million  or of net revenue for fiscal the decrease in r d spending from fiscal to fiscal is driven primarily by reduced impact of the consolidation of two investee companies 
one of these companies was written to and one of these companies was sold during fiscal the other drivers of this expense reduction were reduced compensation for development personnel and reduced spending on masks and related product tooling 
the reduction in compensation was due to a reduction in domestic headcount combined with a reduction in variable compensation 
the decrease in r d expense as a percentage of net revenue from fiscal to is due to the aforementioned spending decreases along with a decrease in net revenue 
the increase in spending from fiscal to was due primarily to increased facilities costs from the acquisition of chip engines  which supplements our system solutions business unit in the non memory segment  increased depreciation as the result of additional cad software investments  and the amortization of technology licenses 
we believe that investments in r d are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace 
as indicated by segment allocation in fiscal and  we devoted greater r d resources to the value added products in our non memory segment 
r d expense may increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to additional personnel we may acquire as we attempt to diversify our product portfolio through the acquisition of new companies and or technologies 
we plan to expand our operations in india with increased investment in engineering and development resources over the next several quarters to the extent that we have the resources to do so 
such additional investment could have an adverse impact on our liquidity in future quarters 
goodwill impairment the annual impairment test performed as of march   indicated that goodwill was not impaired  however  the annual impairment test performed as of march   indicated goodwill to be impaired primarily due to lower than previously expected revenues and  accordingly  we recorded a pretax operating charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the pulsecore acquisition completed in fiscal as a result of this impairment  the carrying value of goodwill is as of march  we recorded this impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal as we had a one full year of unit financial performance to aid us in our analysis and b we had completed our business and financial plans for the next fiscal year which gave us additional visibility into the cash flows attributable to this operating unit

management evaluates its investments in marketable securities for potential other than temporary declines in their value 
such evaluations of our investments include researching commentary from industry experts  analysts and other companies 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a write down on our investment in tower ordinary shares of approximately million due to a decrease in the share price of tower ordinary shares during the last two quarters of fiscal we believe that this decrease is of such duration and magnitude that it is 
table of contents an other than temporary decrease 
at september   the market share price for tower ordinary shares exceeded the carrying value share price for both our short term and long term investment in tower shares 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the share price initially decreased by during the quarter prior to recovering and ending the quarter down by  compared to the end of the second quarter of fiscal given the fact that there had been some recovery in the share price during the latter part of third fiscal quarter  we determined that the share price decrease was not an other than temporary decrease and did not record a write down during the third quarter of fiscal subsequently the share price decreased another during the fourth quarter of fiscal at the time  we had no reason to believe that the value of our investment in tower would recover in the foreseeable future 
this decrease  combined with the fact that tower was not operating at full capacity and was and continues to be heavily leveraged  led us to determine that the reduction in share price was other than temporary as of march  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary write down of million in our investment in tower shares as we determined at that time that the duration and magnitude of the decrease in the share price was such that a recovery in the share price was not imminent 
the share price had decreased by from the end of the first quarter of fiscal to the end of the third quarter of fiscal we recorded pretax  non operating losses of approximately  and million during the third quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  respectively  on our investments in vitesse and chartered common stock 
these write downs were based on the continuing decrease in the investments stock prices compared to the prices used to record the investment along with the expectation that stock prices would not recover in the near term due to unfavorable business conditions for the companies specialty and the semiconductor industry in general 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax  non operating loss of approximately million on our investment in umc common stock 
specifically  this write down was the result of a decrease in the price of umc shares between the end of fiscal and the end of second quarter of fiscal this decrease was the result of deteriorating conditions in the semiconductor industry and the general economy combined with the negative impact on worldwide equity markets after the events of september  at the time  we had no reason to believe that the value of our investment in umc would recover in the foreseeable future and therefore determined that the investment was other than temporarily impaired and that we should record a write down on our investment in umc shares 
we also review the carrying values of our investments in alliance ventures and solar venture partners investee companies for potential impairments 
as many of these companies are in the development stage  these reviews include future market and revenue generating potential  analysis of current and future cash flows  and ongoing product development and future financing activities 
as a result of these reviews  we recorded write downs in our investments in alliance ventures and solar ventures investee companies of million  million  and million during fiscal  and  respectively

we also performed an analysis on individual venture investee companies in accordance with fin consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities vie to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties

factors that may affect future results in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of alliance semiconductor 
we may have difficulties meeting our cash needs 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and future cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  our business has used significant cash over the last several years  and the value of our short term investments in marketable securities  especially our holdings in umc and tower  have declined substantially in value in recent quarters 
we have limited ability to sell these securities  and they may continue to decline in value in the future 
in addition  we are currently the subject of an audit by the internal revenue service with respect to fiscal and tax years through for those years under review we received tax refunds of approximately million 
at this stage of the audit  the irs has informed us that there is a high likelihood that certain positions we have taken may be disallowed 
we believe that it is too early to determine the impact of the resolution of this audit 
if our operating performance falls below expectations  if our short term investments in marketable securities continue to decrease in value or if there is an adverse determination with respect to the audit  we may have difficulties meeting our cash needs 
in order to finance general corporate needs  as well as strategic acquisitions and investments in research and development  we may rely on the debt and equity markets to provide liquidity 
historically  we have been able to access the debt and equity markets  but this does not necessarily guarantee that we will be able to access these markets in the future or on terms that are acceptable to us 
the availability of capital in these markets is affected by several factors  including geopolitical risk  the interest rate environment and the condition of the economy as a whole 
in addition  our own operating performance  capital structure and expected future performance may impact our ability to raise capital 
in the event we are not able to meet our cash needs and raise additional capital  our business operations will be materially and adversely affected 
the majority of our assets consist of securities that we have a limited ability to sell and which have experienced significant declines in value 
we have held  and continue to hold  significant investments in securities of which we have limited ability to dispose 
these assets may experience decline in value as a result of factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our investment in umc  a publicly traded company in taiwan  represents our largest single asset 
umc common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations in value 
for example  the price of umc common stock decreased by approximately during fiscal and may continue to decline in value in the future 
additionally  if we were forced to liquidate a significant portion of our umc common stock  the share price received on such a sale may be negatively impacted by the size of such a sale given our ownership position 
further  umc shares of common stock are 
table of contents not tradable in the united states and are subject to many of the same risks associated with foreign currency 
contractual restrictions also limit our ability to transfer approximately of our investment in tower until january tower stock has been subject to significant fluctuations in value 
for example  during fiscal  the price of tower s ordinary shares decreased by approximately and the price of tower s ordinary shares may continue to decline in value in the future 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax  non operating loss of million on our long term investment in tower shares 
our investment in tower is subject to inherent risks  including those associated with certain israeli regulatory requirements  political unrest and financing difficulties  which could harm tower s business and financial condition 
further  through alliance venture management s investment funds and solar venture partners  we invest in start up companies that are not traded on public markets 
these types of investments are inherently risky and many venture funds have a large percentage of investments decrease in value or fail 
during the past several years  many of our investments in securities experienced significant declines in market value 
for example  during fiscal  we wrote down one of our alliance ventures investments and one of our solar investments and recognized pretax  non operating losses of approximately million and  respectively 
in fiscal  we wrote down nine of our alliance ventures investments and two of our solar investments and recognized pretax  non operating losses of approximately million 
further  we wrote down several of our alliance venture management and solar investments recognizing pretax  non operating losses of approximately million for fiscal we cannot be certain that our investment in these securities will not decline further in value 
further declines in our investments can have a material  adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our financial results could be adversely impacted if we fail to successfully develop  introduce  and sell new products which we have had limited success in doing so to date 
like many semiconductor companies  which operate in a highly competitive  dynamic environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products  our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that customers choose to buy 
although we have recently developed and sold analog and mixed signal and system solutions products to supplement our traditional memory product offerings  we have a limited operating history in these markets  we have limited product offerings in these markets  and we have had limited success with these products and otherwise developing and selling new products 
in fiscal  we wrote down certain of our inventory  recognizing pretax charges of approximately million 
in addition  our performance during fiscal  and was generally characterized by weak demand for our memory products 
although asps of our sram and dram products  and certain of our other products  have generally declined over time  the selling prices for such products are very sensitive to supply and demand conditions in our target markets 
in our most recent quarter we continued to experience declines in the average selling price of most of our sram products and we expect the asps for most of our sram and dram products to decline in the future  principally because of increased market competition and an increased supply of competitive products in the market 
we no longer develop dram products and revenue is derived solely from supplying legacy dram products to existing customers 
as a result  we expect revenue from dram products to comprise a significantly smaller portion of overall revenue in fiscal than in fiscal  and on a quarter to quarter basis 
we expect our dram revenue to eventually decline to in fiscal  revenue from our sale of dram products was approximately million  compared to million in fiscal factors that may affect our ability to develop and sell new products includes our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changes in the requirements of our customers  the significant research and development investment that we may be required to make before market acceptance  if any  of a particular product  the possibility that the semiconductor industry may not accept a new product after we have invested a significant amount of resources to develop it  and new products introduced by our competitors 

table of contents we are affected by a general pattern of product price fluctuations  which has harmed  and may continue to harm  our business 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  product obsolescence and significant price competition and  as a result  are subject to decreases in asps 
although we have recently experienced increased demand for certain of our new products  our overall business during fiscal years  and has generally been characterized by a fundamental slowdown in demand for our products 
more specifically  for several years our performance generally has been adversely affected by severe declines in end user demand for our memory products and asps of all of our products  and we expect this trend to continue in the future principally because of increased market competition and an increased supply of competitive products in the market 
declining asps will adversely affect our gross profit and gross margin 
accordingly  our ability to maintain or increase revenue and gross margin will be highly dependent on our ability to increase unit sales volume  reduce the cost per unit of our existing products  and to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  develop  introduce and sell new products or significantly reduce our cost per unit 
we also cannot be certain that even if we were to increase unit sales volumes and sufficiently reduce our costs per unit  we would be able to maintain or increase revenue or gross margin 
for example  in the last year we wrote down certain of our inventory  consisting principally of sram products  recognizing pretax charges of approximately million 
in fiscal  we decided to discontinue development of new dram products 
our existing dram revenue is derived from selling legacy dram products to our existing customer base 
we expect that revenue from dram products will comprise a significantly smaller percentage of overall revenue in fiscal  and will eventually decline to our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed by efforts to comply with  or penalties associated with  the investment company act of in august  we applied to the sec for an order under section b of the investment company act of confirming our non investment company status 
in march  the staff of the sec informed us that the staff could not support the granting of the requested exemption 
since that time  we have been working to resolve our status under the act 
we cannot be certain that the sec will agree that we are not currently deemed to be an unregistered investment company in violation of the act 
if the sec takes the view that we have been operating and continue to operate as an unregistered investment company in violation of the act  and does not provide us with a sufficient period to either register as an investment company or divest ourselves of investment securities and or acquire non investment assets  we may be subject to significant potential penalties 
in the absence of exemptions granted by the sec which are discretionary in nature and require the sec to make certain findings  we would be required either to register as a closed end investment company under the act  or  in the alternative  to divest ourselves of sufficient investment securities and or to acquire sufficient non investment assets so as not to be regarded as an investment company under the act 
in an effort to comply with the act  we have divested ourselves of certain securities  ceased acquiring interests in any new companies through alliance ventures and taken certain additional actions  nonetheless  we have no assurance that the sec will grant us an exemption under the act 
in the event we are required to register as a closed end investment company under the act  or divest ourselves of sufficient investment securities and or acquire sufficient non investment assets so as not to be regarded as an investment company under the act  our results of operations and financial condition may be materially  adversely affected 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to include an internal controls report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our annual report on form k 
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to  and report on  our management s assessment 
in light of the fact that management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of march   and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting  we have 
table of contents dedicated significant resources to remediate the material weaknesses that have rendered our internal control ineffective 
nonetheless  there is no assurance that we will be able to remediate these weaknesses 
even after we have remediated these weaknesses  in the course of future testing and documentation  certain deficiencies may be discovered that will require additional remediation  the costs of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
separately  our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our management s assessment and may send us a deficiency notice that we are unable to remediate on a timely basis  or we may not be able to retain our independent registered public accounting firm with sufficient resources to attest to and report on our internal control 
moreover  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time our management may continue to conclude that we do not have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section in the future  if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated  if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on our management s evaluation or on the effectiveness of the internal controls  or if our independent registered public accounting firm expresses an adverse opinion on our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
additionally  any material weakness in internal control could result in a material misstatement in future financial statements 
we face additional problems and uncertainties associated with international operations that could seriously harm us 
we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business internationally 
for example  international net revenue  principally from customers in europe and asia  constituted approximately of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal all of our foundries and a majority of our assembly and test subcontractors are abroad  and we conduct significant operations in india  which we expect to continue to expand significantly over the next several years 
accordingly  our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens and complexities of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
we cannot be certain that such factors will not adversely impact our results of operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
we rely on third parties to manufacture our products and problems in their performance can seriously harm our financial results 
we currently rely on independent foundries  including assembly and test facilities  all of which are located overseas  to manufacture all of our products 
reliance on these foundries involves several risks  including constraints or delays in timely delivery of our products  reduced control over delivery schedules  inability of these foundries to maintain or increase manufacturing capability and capacity as necessary  failure of these foundries to develop and implement new and competitive ways of manufacturing our products  quality assurance and costs  and loss of production due to seismic activity  weather conditions and other factors 
in addition  reduced yields in the manufacturing process of our products may adversely affect our operating results 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and a foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing 
table of contents failures 
yield problems may not be determined or improved until an actual product is made and can be tested 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process 
the risks associated with yields are even greater because we rely exclusively on offshore foundries and assembly and test facilities  which increase the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if the foundries cannot achieve planned yields  we will experience higher costs and reduced product availability  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we continuously evaluate sources of supply and may seek to add foundry capacity  we cannot be certain that such additional capacity can be obtained at acceptable prices  if at all 
the occurrence of any supply or other problem resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or require us to modify our current business practices 
we also rely on offshore subcontractors for die assembly and testing of products  and are subject to the risks of disruption in adequate supply of such services and quality problems associated with such services 
we must build products based on demand forecasts  if such forecasts are inaccurate  we may incur significant losses  and we have taken inventory write downs recently 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of advanced process wafer fabrication capacity such as we have experienced from time to time 
our ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory is primarily dependent upon us obtaining sufficient supply of products to meet future demand  and inability to maintain adequate inventory levels may adversely affect our relations with our customers 
in addition  we must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  and there is a risk that because demand for our products is volatile and subject to rapid technology and price change  we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of our key customers place orders with short lead times 
our customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect our liquidity  as we may be unable to adjust our purchases from our independent foundries to match such customer changes and cancellations 
we have in the past produced excess quantities of certain products  which have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  in fiscal we wrote down certain of our inventory recognizing pretax charges of approximately million 
in fiscal and  we recorded pretax charges totaling approximately million and million  respectively  primarily to reflect such excess and a decline in market value of certain inventory 
we cannot be certain that in the future we will not produce excess quantities of any of our products 
we also recorded a write down of our investment in tower wafer credits of million during the second quarter of fiscal we also cannot be certain that additional write downs of wafer credits will not occur in future periods 
to the extent we produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to compete successfully in a highly competitive industry 
we face intense competition  and many of our principal competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do  any of which factors may place such competitors and potential competitors in a stronger competitive position than us 
in addition  the intense competition we face could result in pricing pressures  reduced product revenue  reduced margins or lost market share  any of which could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
we have also recently started selling analog and mixed signal and system solutions products 
the markets for these products include additional competitors  such as cypress semiconductor corporation  ics incorporated  integrated silicon solutions  inc  maxim integrated products  plx technology inc  pericom semiconductor corporation  samsung corporation  toshiba corporation  and other us  japanese  korean and taiwanese manufacturers 
because of our limited operating history in these markets  we may have difficulties competing with more established companies in these markets 
our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving semiconductor technology industry depends on many factors  including our success in developing new products  the quality and price of our products  
table of contents the diversity of our product line  the cost effectiveness of our design  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts  our customer service  our customer satisfaction  the pace at which customers incorporate our products into their systems  the number and nature of our competitors and general economic conditions  and our access to and availability of capital on terms acceptable to us 
increases in raw materials prices may significantly harm our results 
our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials that must meet exacting standards 
we generally have more than one source available for these materials  but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards 
there is an ongoing risk that the suppliers of wafer fabrication  wafer sort  assembly and test services to us may increase the price charged to us for the services they provide  to the point that we may not be able to profitably have our products produced by such suppliers 
we believe capacity utilization at our suppliers may increase in the future 
typically  if capacity utilization is high for an extended period of time  we will experience increased prices from our suppliers 
we cannot be certain that such increases will not occur in the near future 
the occurrence of such price increases could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in addition  the interruption of our sources of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future results are likely to fluctuate and failure to meet financial expectations for any period may cause our stock price to decline 
our results of operations have historically been  and will continue to be  subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the semiconductor industry generally  changes in our pricing policies as well as those of our competitors and suppliers  anticipated and unanticipated decreases in unit asps of our products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from our suppliers  increased research and development expense associated with new product introductions  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  seasonal customer demand  and the timing of significant orders 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and one should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
these factors  together with the fact that our expense is primarily fixed and independent of revenue in any particular period  make it difficult for us to accurately predict our revenue and operating results and may cause them to be below market analysts expectations in some future quarters  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly 
we face periods of industry wide semiconductor over supply that harm our results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for  and supply of  semiconductors 
these fluctuations have helped produce many occasions when supply and demand for semiconductors have not been in balance 
these industry wide fluctuations in demand have in the past seriously harmed our operating results and we have generally experienced  and expect to continue to experience in the future  declining asps for many of our products 
if these conditions were to persist  a restructuring of operations  resulting in significant restructuring charges  may become necessary 

table of contents we face risks related to sales of our products 
sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenue 
in addition  our sales are generally made by standard purchase orders rather than long term contracts  and as a result  we cannot predict if and when our customers will purchase additional products from us 
therefore  if we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers  our revenue and operating results would suffer 
we may fail to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire 
in the past  we have acquired other companies such as pulsecore and chip engines and we may continue to acquire additional companies in the future 
integrating businesses is expensive and time consuming and it imposes a great strain on our resources 
some specific difficulties in the integration process may include failure to successfully develop acquired in process technology  the difficulty of integrating acquired technology or products  unanticipated expense related to technology integration and the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
if we fail to integrate these businesses successfully  our quarterly and annual results may be seriously harmed 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
fluctuations or a decline in our stock price may occur regardless of our performance 
among the factors that could affect our stock price  in addition to our performance  are variations between our operating results and the published expectations of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new products or services  acquisitions  or other significant transactions  sale of our common stock or other securities in the future  the inclusion or exclusion of our stock in various indices or investment categories  especially as compared to the investment profiles of our stockholders at a given time  changes in economic and capital market conditions  changes in business regulatory conditions  and the trading volume of our common stock 
in the event our stock trades below the minimum bid price per share of at least for thirty consecutive trading days  our stock may be subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
a low stock price may trigger violation of other nasdaq listing standards 
delisting from nasdaq would adversely affect the trading price and limit the liquidity of our common stock and cause the value of an investment in our company to substantially decrease 
we are exposed to the risks associated with the slowdown in the us and worldwide economy 
among other factors  in the past decreased consumer confidence and spending and reduced corporate profits and capital spending have resulted in a downturn in the us economy generally and in the semiconductor industry in particular 
we experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders across nearly all of our memory product lines during fiscal years and and the first three quarters of fiscal in addition  we experienced corresponding decreases in revenue and average selling price across most of our product lines during fiscal years and  and the first three quarters of fiscal and expect continued pressure on asps in the future 
additional restructuring of operations may be required  and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed  if economic conditions were to deteriorate or worsen 

table of contents quarterly shipments are typically weighted to the end of a quarter 
we usually ship more products in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with shipments in the third month higher at the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor industry  is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause our quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  a disruption in our production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce our net sales for that quarter 
our reliance on outside foundries and independent assembly and testing houses reduces our ability to control  among other things  delivery schedules 
if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property through the issuance and enforcement of patents  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we protect our proprietary intellectual property through the filing of patents 
we cannot be certain  however  that any current or future united states or foreign patent applications would be approved  patents  if issued  would adequately protect our intellectual property and would not be challenged by third parties  the validity of any issued patents would be upheld  the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business as we seek to conduct it  and others will not independently develop similar or competing intellectual property or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
if any of the above were to occur  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to protect and maintain the ownership of intellectual property created by us  our business  and results of operations could be harmed 
we rely primarily on a combination of license  development and nondisclosure agreements  trademark  trade secret and copyright law and contractual provisions to protect our other  non patentable intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  our licensees and others may seek to use our technology without the payment of license fees and royalties  which could weaken our competitive position  adversely affect our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation 
in addition  effective trade secret protection may be unavailable in certain foreign countries 
although we intend to continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  if we are unsuccessful in doing so  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we may be unable to defend our intellectual property rights and may face significant expense as a result of ongoing or future litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have from time to time received  and believe that we likely will in the future receive  notices alleging that our products  or the processes used to manufacture our products  infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  or claims against us for indemnification related to such third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of us could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from other matters 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  we might be required to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 

table of contents our operations could be severely harmed by natural disasters or other disruptions to the foundries at which we subcontract manufacturing 
our corporate headquarters located in the san francisco bay area is near major earthquake faults  and we are subject to the risk of damage or disruption in the event of seismic activity 
in addition  we subcontract our wafer fabrication  assembly and testing to independent foundries 
we have in the past experienced disruption of the operations at our foundries  and any future disruptions for any reason  including work stoppages  an outbreak of epidemic  fire  earthquakes  or other natural disasters could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain that any of the foregoing factors will not materially adversely affect our results of operations 
if a major earthquake or other natural disaster occurs  we may require significant amounts of time and money to resume operations and we could suffer damages that could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
any guidance that we may provide about our business or expected future results may prove to be inaccurate 
from time to time  we share our views in press releases or sec filings  on public conference calls and in other contexts about current business conditions and our expectations as to potential future results 
predicting future events is inherently uncertain 
our analyses and forecasts have in the past and  given the complexity and volatility of our business  will likely in the future  prove to be incorrect 
we cannot be certain that such predictions or analyses will ultimately be accurate  and investors should treat any such predictions or analyses with appropriate caution 
any analysis or forecast made by us that ultimately proves to be inaccurate may adversely affect our stock price 
we depend on third parties to transport our products 
we rely on independent carriers and freight haulers to move our products between manufacturing plants and our customers 
any transport or delivery problems because of their errors or because of unforeseen interruptions in their activities due to factors such as strikes  political instability  terrorism  natural disasters and accidents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expense 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel who are critical to the success of our business 
we depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of our founders  n 
damodar reddy  chairman of the board  our chief executive officer and president  and his brother cn reddy  our executive vice president for investments and director  whom we collectively refer to as the reddys  as well as other officers  operational personnel and key design personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in the last few years  a number of officers and design personnel left us to pursue various other opportunities 
to 
table of contents date  these departures did not have a material impact on our business  but future departures can cause the delay of some projects 
in addition  we need to enhance our existing finance staff 
in fiscal  we did not maintain effective controls over our inventory and cost of goods sold accounts 
specifically  we did not have effective controls to adequately identify  document and analyze work in process and finished goods inventory held at third party subcontractors or to determine the reserves for slow moving and excess and obsolete inventory in accordance with gaap 
these control deficiencies have resulted in an audit adjustment to net inventory for the year ended march  additionally  if not remediated  this control deficiency could result in a misstatement to the future financial statements 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  management  and finance personnel for which competition is intense globally 
the loss of either of the reddys or design personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  limited human resources and untimely turnovers in the operational staff many result in difficulties in implementing our policies and procedures including those related to our internal controls 
we are not insured against the loss of any of our key employees  nor can we assure the successful recruitment of new and replacement personnel 
liquidity and capital resources at march  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from march   and approximately million in net working capital  a decrease of million from approximately million at march  we had short term investments in marketable securities whose fair value was million and million at march  and march   respectively 
during fiscal  operating activities used cash of million 
this was primarily the result of a net loss of million adjusted for non cash charges of million combined with the following changes in assets and liabilities a decrease in our net deferred tax liability of million 
this is driven primarily by a decrease in the gross value of our short term investments in umc and tower which results in a lower future tax liability upon liquidation of these investments 
an increase in inventory of million which is driven by actual revenue not meeting the forecasted sales which drove additional inventory purchases 
a decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable of million due to reductions in operating expenditures as well as more timely payments to vendors 
a decrease in accounts receivable and other assets of million which was due to improved cash collections on a smaller revenue base 
during fiscal  operating activities used cash of million 
this was primarily the result of a net loss of million adjusted for non cash charges of million  a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of million and an increase in inventory of million  offset by an income tax refund of million  an increase in accounts payable of million and a decrease in related party receivables of million 
the increase in inventory during fiscal was due to sales forecasts being higher than the actual sales achieved during the year 
during fiscal  operating activities used million 
this was primarily the result of a net loss of million adjusted for non cash charges of million and a decrease in tax payable and net deferred tax liabilities of million  offset by a decrease in inventory of million 
investing activities provided cash of million during fiscal this is primarily the result of a sale of marketable securities for proceeds of million  offset by purchases of alliance ventures and other investments of million  property and equipment purchases of  and the purchase of non exclusive technology licenses for  proceeds from the sale of shares of umc common stock provided million of the million in total proceeds 
investing activities provided cash of million during fiscal this is primarily the result of sales of marketable securities for million  partially offset by an 
table of contents additional  contractual investment in tower for million  purchases of alliance ventures and other investments of million  property and equipment purchases of million  and the purchase of technology licenses for  during fiscal  investing activities provided million 
this resulted from proceeds of marketable securities sales of million offset by additional  contractual investments in tower of million  additional venture investments of million  property and equipment purchases of million and the purchase of a perpetual  royalty free technology license of million 
financing activities provided cash of  during fiscal this is primarily the result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  offset by principal payments on lease obligations of  financing activities used cash of million during fiscal this is primarily the result of the repayment of short term debt of million 
during fiscal  financing activities used million 
this resulted from million of stock repurchases through an approved stock buyback plan and million of short term debt repayment offset by the release of million in restricted cash 
the stock buyback plan was subsequently terminated 
at march  and  we had no short term borrowings 
at march   we had short term borrowings totaling million 
we believe these sources of liquidity and financing will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products  wafer capacity or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling some of our short term investments  selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our stockholders and us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  we have entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  the formation of joint ventures to own and operate foundries  as was originally the case with chartered  umc and tower  or the usage of take or pay contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
additionally  we have entered into and will continue to enter into various transactions  including the licensing of our integrated circuit designs in exchange for royalties  fees or guarantees of manufacturing capacity

trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value we have used derivative financial instruments to manage the market risk of certain short term investments 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and are reported in short term investments and long term obligations 
classification of each derivative as current or non current is based upon whether the maturity of each instrument is less than or greater than months

these criteria demonstrate that the derivative is 
table of contents expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying exposure both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis 
the assessment for effectiveness is formally documented at hedge inception and reviewed at least quarterly throughout the designated hedge period 
we apply hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and changes in market values of our investments 
the entities in which we hold investments operate in markets that have experienced significant market price fluctuations during the year ended march  these entities  in which we hold varying percentage interests  operate and sell their products in various global markets  however  the majority of their sales are denominated in us dollars thus mitigating much of the foreign currency risk 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments at march  investment risk as of march   our short term investment portfolio consisted of marketable equity securities in umc and tower 
these securities are subject to market fluctuations 
during fiscal  we liquidated our position in vitesse and adaptec  inc and reclassified  ordinary shares of tower from long term to short term 
as of march   our short term investment portfolio consisted of marketable equity securities in umc  tower  vitesse and adaptec  inc during fiscal  we liquidated our positions in chartered  pmc sierra  magma and broadcom and settled the broadcom hedge instrument 
we also reclassified  ordinary shares of tower from long term to short term in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded this investment as an available for sale marketable security in accordance with sfas as of march   we have  shares of tower that are classified as short term 
during the last six months of fiscal  our investment in tower experienced a decline in value due to softness in the semiconductor industry  tower s financial performance and general market conditions
