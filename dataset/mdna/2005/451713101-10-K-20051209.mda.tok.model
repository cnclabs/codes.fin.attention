item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategy overview our primary strategy is to integrate imaging systems and services to help businesses manage document workflow and increase the functionality and efficiency of their document workflow strategies 
we intend to continue to execute on the following key strategies in order to leverage our strengths and position ourselves for long term growth and success operational leverage 
we are focused on reducing our cost structure to improve profitability 
our initiatives include a conversion to a common enterprise wide information technology platform  billing process improvements designed to assure the timeliness and accuracy of our customer invoices  and the reduction of administrative costs 
we are also using the six sigma methodology  which is designed to eliminate process defects from the customer s perspective  to simplify and streamline processes in other areas of our business see efficiency initiatives 
in addition  we are focused on continued cost reductions at every level of the company  including administrative and real estate costs and employee benefits expenses 
another element of operational leverage is organizational development 
we will continue to invest in development opportunities across the company and strive to achieve best practices in organizational vitality  diversity  sales force engagement  and new leader assimilation 
growth and expansion 
we believe that generating core and related market growth are the two primary drivers of enhanced market leadership 
within our core markets  we are targeting the mid market to leverage the scope and reach of our sales and service capabilities across north america and 
table of contents western europe 
this target market accounts for a meaningful portion of our revenue and remains an essential part of our business 
additionally  we are investing in sales force effectiveness initiatives 
we continue to direct our business mix toward higher growth areas such as color and high volume equipment  professional services and outsourcing relationships 
to improve aftermarket supplies and maintenance revenues  we are investing in market share strategies that are designed to increase unit placements and result in the higher margins associated with post sales revenue 
we have added resources dedicated to securing relationships in our national accounts target market  which includes companies in the fortune and other large global and private companies 
our customers in this market represent a wide range of industries  including healthcare  financial services  retail and manufacturing 
in terms of related expansion  our two principal focus areas are enterprise services and europe 
within enterprise services  we will seek to ensure that our products and services portfolio is customer focused  services centric  and flexible 
we will continue to lead with document strategy assessments  and leverage the strength of our combined services offerings to cross sell in existing accounts and add new customers 
with our portfolio of document management solutions  enterprise services delivers document management solutions that address the specific document challenges of both office and production environments 
in europe  we will continue to expand into related markets to extend our reach through our city expansion strategy  targeting major markets with substantial opportunity for growth  and pan european account program  focusing on large  multi national accounts 
we will also seek to leverage our enterprise services strategy to drive new business across europe 
capital structure 
over the last several years  we have focused on maximizing cash flow  reducing debt and reducing outstanding shares of our common stock by implementing initiatives to enhance our profitability 
we have reduced corporate debt which does not include debt attributable to our finance business from  at september  to  at september  in addition  during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for  the sale of a portion of our north american lease portfolio in march generated a significant amount of cash and enabled us to reduce the financing risk inherent in a captive leasing business 
we are focused on cash generation through reductions in our working capital  in particular the reduction of our accounts receivable balance  through improvement in our billing processes and increasing the efficiency of our processing of new leases funded by ge 
we believe these working capital improvements  combined with growth in our targeted revenue streams and reductions in administrative costs  will be catalysts for future cash flow generation 
general business developments we were incorporated in ohio in and are the successor to a business incorporated in from through  we aggressively acquired businesses  including those that provided traditional office equipment products and services  outsourcing and imaging services  and technology products and services 
beginning in fiscal  we ceased our acquisition activity in north america and began to focus on developing and executing strategies to integrate the acquired companies and organize the company into a more efficient and cohesive operating structure 
during fiscal  we conducted a broad based review of our business in an effort to improve our cost competitiveness and productivity 
the focus of this effort was not only to identify cost cutting initiatives  but also to identify areas of opportunity in which to gain efficiencies and to invest the resulting savings in areas that are critical to our long term success and that would increase productivity 
accordingly  during the past several years we have changed our business in the following major areas business division integration 
beginning in fiscal  we created our reporting units  ikon north america ina and ikon europe ie  by integrating our business services  managed services  and captive finance subsidiaries 
our business service offerings include traditional copiers  printers  mfp technologies  and other office equipment and services 
managed services includes the management of our customers mailrooms  copy centers  and general administrative facilities  as well as off site managed services through legal document services see product and service offerings 

table of contents during the past several years  we have focused on developing and growing ina and ie by enhancing our growth platforms and de emphasizing the sale of lower margin technology services  hardware  and software in north america and europe 
through our captive finance subsidiaries  we arranged lease financing primarily for equipment marketed by us 
in fiscal  we entered into the us program agreement and the canadian rider to enable ge to provide lease financing for equipment marketed by us in the us and canada  including copiers  fax machines  and related accessories and peripheral equipment  the majority of which are manufactured by canon and ricoh 
in addition  in fiscal  we announced the consolidation of our three us regions into two regions in order to continue to centralize and streamline our operational structure 
operations integration and enhancements 
as we have integrated our business divisions over the past several years  we have taken actions to centralize and consolidate a variety of operational functions  including i integrating and consolidating our financial and accounting functions into shared service centers  ii establishing customer care centers  and iii developing a national supply chain organization to leverage our buying power with suppliers and streamline our distribution and inventory management processes 
we have aligned the service and sales functions of our marketplace activities and have implemented a sales coverage model to align our sales professionals with the right opportunities to effectively manage their territories see efficiency initiatives 
product transition 
virtually all of the new office equipment we distribute represents digital technology as compared to analog  which has the ability to communicate across a network  enabling work to be performed collaboratively and often eliminates the distinction between traditional copiers  fax equipment  and printers 
we have continued to focus on the distribution of color products and digital multifunction office equipment that enable our customers to print  copy  scan  and fax  from one device 
we believe that the office equipment market will continue to change with the increasing acceptance of black and white multifunction and color technology and that the manufacturers of the products we distribute will continue to focus on developing and manufacturing these products 
the evolution of digital technology has allowed our suppliers to develop high end segment and equipment equipment with output speeds in excess of pages per minute and color products 
we have pursued opportunities to market these high end products 
during fiscal  sales of high end equipment and color products represented approximately of our office equipment revenues in north america 
equipment financing 
during fiscal  we sold certain of our assets  including facilities  systems and processes relating to our us and canadian leasing operations  to ge and designated ge as our preferred lease financing source in the us and canada 
prior to our arrangement with ge  a significant portion of our profits were derived from our leasing operations in the us and canada 
pursuant to the agreements governing our relationship with ge  we are entitled to receive origination and certain other fees and income from sharing of gains on certain lease end activities with respect to future leases funded by ge 
our right to receive a portion of these fees will end as of march   which is the end of the initial five year term of our us lease program agreement 
segments statement of financial accounting standards sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas requires segment data to be measured and analyzed on a basis that is consistent with how business activities are reported internally to management 
revenue and profit information about our reportable segments in accordance with sfas is presented on pages through of this report

lease financing 
equipment lease financing to our north american customers mainly through the us program agreement and canadian rider 
equipment lease financing is offered to our european customers through our captive finance subsidiaries in europe 
we are in the midst of a rapidly changing and competitive industry 
we recognize the shifts taking place in our industry and we have been positioning ourselves to compete in this dynamic environment 
we continue to refine our strategy by forming alliances with leading suppliers to expand and enhance our products and services portfolio 
during fiscal  we continued to strengthen our product mix by moving toward higher end black and white and color solutions 
we offer a range of high volume black and white systems from canon and ricoh in speeds up to pages per minute with the canon imagerunner in october  we expanded our relationship with konica minolta and launched the ikon printcenterpro tm  a page per minute monochrome device  giving ikon customers a strong solution in the mid production area 
our color portfolio includes dedicated color systems from canon  along with a range of color capable black and white devices from canon and ricoh 
during fiscal  we launched the high speed digital color printer copier systems  the ikon cpp tm and ikon businesspro tm c  successors to the ikon cpp tm and the ikon cpp tm e 
these product offerings utilize certain new technology of konica minolta to provide customers with high quality and high performance color output 
placements of this equipment are also a key building block to developing growth opportunities in our various service offerings

efficiency initiatives we continued to invest in new market opportunities and to streamline our infrastructure during fiscal these investments and efficiency initiatives are aimed at making us more profitable and competitive in the long term 
remediation of the billing matter continues to be a key priority for ikon 
in fiscal  we added billing directors to our customer care centers in the us  and aligned our billing teams to specific geographic areas and customers  to drive accountability for timely and accurate billing 
we will continue to invest in billing process improvements in fiscal we also continued to implement our common 
table of contents information technology platform  which is based primarily on the oracle e business suite  in our markets in north america and europe 
in fiscal  we will continue to allocate resources to the ongoing implementation of our common information technology platform 
in fiscal  we continued to utilize the six sigma methodology to drive increased customer satisfaction and process improvement 
customers our customer base is broad and diverse  consisting of approximately  organizations consisting of global and national companies  including approximately of the fortune companies  major regional companies  mid size businesses  professional services firms and local  state  and federal government agencies 
except as discussed below  no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues during fiscal we do  however  have certain major customers 
the loss of  or major reduction in business from  one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
while we sell equipment to ge in the us and canada  as the case may be  in connection with the leasing transactions contemplated by the us program agreement and canadian rider  respectively  ge is not the intended end user of the equipment 
in these transactions  ge is the equipment lessor to the end user 
accordingly  we do not consider ge to be a customer  despite the fact that we recognize revenue from these equipment sales to ge 
during fiscal  approximately of our revenues were attributed to equipment sales to ge in north america in connection with our lease program relationship 
suppliers and inventory our business is dependent upon our relationships with our primary suppliers and our ability to continue to purchase products from these suppliers on competitive terms 
the products we distribute are purchased from numerous domestic and international suppliers  primarily canon  ricoh  konica minolta  efi  and hp 
we also rely on our equipment suppliers for parts and supplies see general business development and product and service offerings 
we conduct our business in reliance upon our continuing ability to purchase equipment  supplies  and parts from our current suppliers pursuant to authorized retail dealer and wholesale agreements 
however  we do not enter into long term supply contracts with these suppliers and we have no current plans to do so in the future 
many of our operations carry inventory to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 
at september   inventories accounted for approximately of our current assets  which we believe is consistent with general industry standards 
proprietary matters we have a number of trademarks  trade names  service marks  and other marks containing the word ikon  which we use in conducting our business 
other than the ikon office solutions and other marks containing the word ikon and their related marks  we do not believe that any single name  trademark  trade name  or service mark is material to our businesses taken as a whole 
further  we have a policy of protecting our proprietary rights  including mandating the execution of confidentiality agreements whenever there is a potential transaction through which we may disclose confidential or proprietary information  and or license or permit the use of any of our marks 
however  any of our proprietary rights could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
moreover  there is no guarantee that our proprietary rights will provide any significant competitive advantages 

table of contents environmental regulation we are presently engaged in distribution and services businesses that do not generate significant hazardous wastes 
some of our distribution facilities have tanks for storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products that are subject to laws regulating such storage tanks 
federal  state  and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
we are involved in a number of environmental remediation actions to investigate and clean up certain sites related to our discontinued operations in accordance with applicable federal and state laws 
uncertainties about the status of laws and regulations  technology and information related to individual sites  including the magnitude of possible contamination  the timing and extent of required corrective actions and proportionate liabilities of other responsible parties  make it difficult to develop a meaningful estimate of probable future remediation costs 
the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  and any studies performed for a site 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
after consideration of the defenses available to us  the accrual for such exposure  insurance coverage  and other responsible parties  management does not believe that our obligations to remediate these sites would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
see item below for additional information 
employees at september   we had approximately  employees 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
some of our employees in western europe and mexico are members of labor unions 
competition the competitive marketplace is highly fragmented  characterized by many small local and regional competitors and a few large national competitors 
a number of companies worldwide with significant financial resources and customer relationships compete with us to provide similar products and services 
ina and ie provide substantially similar products and services and compete directly against companies such as xerox  pitney bowes  global imaging systems  oc imagistics and danka 
ina and ie also compete against certain of their significant suppliers  such as canon  ricoh  konica minolta  and hp 
in addition  ina and ie compete against smaller local independent office equipment distributors 
we compete primarily on the basis of technology  performance  price  quality  reliability  distribution  customer service  and support 
in order to remain competitive  we must improve our products and services portfolio by obtaining from our suppliers new products and services  periodically enhancing our existing products and services  and continually striving to improve our technology  performance  quality  reliability  distribution  customer service  and support 
our future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in our currently served markets and to expand into additional markets and product and services offerings 
we believe that our continued focus on the needs of our customers  our ability to consistently deliver superior service and support  and our strong customer relationships will distinguish us from our competitors 
foreign operations we have operations in western europe  canada  and mexico 
approximately of our revenues from continuing operations are derived from our international operations  and approximately of those revenues are derived from the united kingdom and canada 
our future revenues  costs of operations  and profits could be affected by a number of factors related to our international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in economic conditions from country to country  changes in a country s 
table of contents political condition  trade protection measures  licensing and other legal requirements  and local tax issues 
for example  significant currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar  british pound  or euro versus the us dollar could lead to lower reported consolidated results of operations due to the translation of these currencies

item legal proceedings we are involved in a number of environmental remediation actions to investigate and clean up certain sites related to our discontinued operations in accordance with applicable federal and state laws 
uncertainties about the status of laws and regulations  technology and information related to individual sites  including the magnitude of possible contamination  the timing and extent of required corrective actions and proportionate liabilities of other responsible parties  make it difficult to develop a meaningful estimate of probable future remediation costs 
while the actual costs of remediation at these sites may vary from management s estimate because of these uncertainties  we had accrued balances  included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  of  and  as of september  and september   respectively  for our environmental liabilities  and the accrual is based on management s best estimate of our environmental exposure 
the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  and any assessments performed at a site 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
after consideration of the legal and regulatory alternatives available to us  the accrual for such exposure  insurance coverage and the obligations of other responsible parties identified at some sites  management does not believe that its obligations to remediate these sites would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the accruals for such environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as part of other long term liabilities

in addition to the sites with formalized cost sharing arrangements  the company is also involved in a number of other environmental remediation actions to investigate and clean up certain sites related to our discontinued operations in accordance with applicable federal and state laws

for fiscal  we outlined the following objectives for our business operational leverage  core growth  and related expansion 
during fiscal  we also added capital structure as a key objective for our business 
operational leverage requires that we continue to lower our overall cost to serve and improve both sales and administrative productivity through centralization and process and system enhancements 
we made significant progress in this area in fiscal for the year  selling and administrative expenses decreased compared to fiscal we exited unprofitable and non strategic businesses to reset our revenue base centered upon our core strengths 
we discontinued our business document services bds unit  reduced the number of our legal document services lds sites  reorganized our field structure in north america  reduced corporate staff  and sold substantially all of our operations in mexico and france 
selling and administrative expenses were reduced across all areas of the company  including headcount  business operations and real estate 
we also froze our us defined benefit pension plans during fiscal to reduce future pension cost 
in addition  we gained valuable insight into our operations as a result of our work performed to review internal controls over certain revenue and billing processes see item a  controls and procedures 
we have maintained our focus on improvements in the customer care centers and in our billing operations  aimed at productivity and efficiency in the near term 
core growth has three points of focus improvement of sales effectiveness in all market areas  gain of market share in under represented markets  and the targeting of product segments in which demand is growing the fastest 
we strengthened our share of the market encompassing the fortune and large global and private companies national accounts by adding new accounts during fiscal we continue to compete for new deals through a combination of customer incentives and selectively investing in sales headcount growth 
the focus on national accounts and mid market sales resulted in continued growth of total equipment placements during fiscal color equipment placements in the us increased during the year with revenues generated from the sale of color devices increasing 
to ensure that we capture the 
table of contents fastest growing product technologies  we continued to strengthen our color equipment portfolio with a diversified mixture of products 
we continue geographic expansion in promising markets in europe and new service opportunities within enterprise services that differentiate and build solidly on our core business  which involves equipment sales and the ongoing volume in services and supplies that those sales generate 
total european revenue increased in fiscal this is primarily driven by a growth of approximately in equipment  resulting from the success of our pan european and global accounts initiatives  which focuses on large  multi national accounts 
within enterprise services  north american on site managed services delivered strong growth  with revenue up and continued growth within the existing install base 
off site managed services experienced a revenue decline partially driven by our decision to close unprofitable lds sites in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we made substantial progress on improving our capital structure by reducing debt  repurchasing shares of our common stock  and improving our liquidity 
at september   unrestricted cash was million 
total debt declined to billion  and our debt to capital ratio decreased from at september  to at september  we also restructured our debt by issuing million in senior unsecured notes and purchasing approximately million of our convertible notes during fiscal we paid million in dividends to shareholders and purchased million of our shares for a total of million 
we believe these initiatives to improve our capital structure will enhance long term value for our shareholders and provide the sound financial foundation we need to pursue growth opportunities and address competitive challenges 
for fiscal  we had revenues of billion  representing a decline from fiscal this decline was due in large measure to the decrease in finance income as a result of the sales of our north american leasing business and our operating subsidiaries in france and mexico  lower sales of de emphasized technology hardware  lower direct supply sales and lower managed services and customer services revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues as a result of benefits realized from the fees received under the us program agreement and the canadian rider compared to fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal were

for fiscal  our objectives will include continued focus on improving operational leverage  core growth  related expansion  and capital structure 
critical accounting policies we have identified below the accounting policies critical to our business and results of operations 
we determined the critical accounting policies by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the needs to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we install the majority of the equipment we sell 
revenues for company installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon credit approval  receipt of a signed sale or lease contract  and a delivery and acceptance certificate 
the delivery and acceptance certificate confirms that the product has been delivered to and accepted by the customer under the sales or lease contract 
revenues for customer installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon credit approval  receipt of a signed sale or lease contract  and delivery 
generally  we do not offer any equipment warranties in addition to those that are provided by the equipment 
table of contents manufacturer 
revenues for sales of supplies are recognized at time of shipment  following the placement of an order from a customer 
revenues for monthly equipment service and facilities management service are recognized in the month in which the service is performed 
professional services revenues are recognized as earned 
revenues for other services and rentals are recognized in the period performed 
for those customer leases under which ikon is the equipment lessor ikon lease paper  the present value of payments due under sales type lease contracts is recorded as revenue within net sales when products are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and finance income is recognized over the related lease term 
fees earned under the us program agreement and the canadian rider are recognized as they are earned see note to the consolidated financial statements 
supporting our objective to provide complete solutions to our customers  we generally bundle a service agreement with copier printer equipment when sold 
the typical agreement includes a minimum number of copies for a base service fee plus an overage charge for any copies in excess of the minimum 
revenue for each element of a bundled contract is derived from our national price lists for equipment and service 
the national price lists for equipment include a price range between the manufacturers suggested retail price msrp and the minimum price for which our sales force is permitted to sell equipment without prior approval from a higher level of management within our field services organization 
the price lists for equipment are updated monthly to reflect any supplier communicated changes in msrp and any changes in the fair value for which equipment is being sold to customers 
the national price lists for service reflect the price of service charged to customers 
the price lists for service are updated quarterly to reflect new service offerings and any changes in the competitive environment affecting the fair value for which service is being provided to customers 
the national price lists  therefore  are representative of the fair value of each element of a bundled agreement when it is sold unaccompanied by the other elements 
revenue for a bundled contract is first allocated to service revenue using the fair value per our national price lists 
the remaining revenue is allocated to equipment revenue and finance income based on a net present value calculation utilizing an appropriate interest rate that considers the creditworthiness of the customer  term of the lease  transaction size  and costs of financing 
the equipment revenue is compared to the national price lists 
if the equipment revenue falls within the price range per the national price lists  no adjustment is required 
if the equipment revenue is not within the price range per the national price lists  service and equipment revenues are proportionately adjusted while holding the interest rate constant  so that both service and equipment revenues fall within the price range per the national price lists 
as discussed under item a  controls and procedures  during fiscal  management identified certain control deficiencies in the company s internal controls over certain revenue and billing processes  and as a result  concluded that these deficiencies constituted a material weakness the material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in light of the material weakness  we implemented processes and performed additional procedures designed to ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles see item a  controls and procedures 
billed revenue and the related accounts receivable are reduced based on estimates derived by a statistically valid analysis based on historical data to mitigate the financial impact of the material weakness 
changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform a goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
we perform the review by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to its carrying value 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and judgments including the identification of the appropriate reporting units and the calculation of their fair value 
we use a combination of discounted cash flow projections and terminal values to calculate fair value 
our estimate of future cash flows and terminal values includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual future cash flows 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods and consist of finished goods available for sale 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
allowances for receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  changes to our allowances may be required 
income taxes income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of liabilities and assets using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas also provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely 
in assessing the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
however  in the event that we determine the value of a deferred tax asset has fluctuated from its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary 
pension we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for the majority of our employees 
the benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation 
all us employees hired before july  are eligible to participate in the us defined benefit pension plans covering active employees together with the directors retirement plan identified as the us plans 
effective september   the us plans were frozen  other than the directors retirement plan  which was discontinued in and only provides benefits to three retired directors 
accordingly  no active employees will accrue benefits under the us plans after september  all uk employees hired on or after april  and all canada employees hired on or after october  are not eligible to participate in the uk and canadian defined benefit pension plans  respectively  covering active employees the non us plans 
accounting for pensions requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  mortality  and employee turnover 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  perform the required calculations to determine expense and liabilities for pension benefits 
actual results that differ from our actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 

table of contents pension assumptions assumptions used to determine periodic pension costs for the defined benefit pension plans were fiscal fiscal fiscal us us us us us us plans plans plans plans plans plans weighted average discount rates rates of increase in compensation levels expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions used to determine benefit obligation as of the end of each fiscal year for the defined benefit pension plans were ended september us us us us us us plans plans plans plans plans plans weighted average discount rates rates of increase in compensation levels the discount rate is determined at each measurement date after consideration of numerous factors and indices 
in particular  and with the assistance of our financial consultants  we review the following high quality  fixed income indices  as we believe these indices reflect the duration of the liabilities under the us plans moody s aa bond averages plus a spread to approximate the duration of our plan liabilities  the zero coupon treasury bond rates  and the citigroup pension discount curve 
prior to fiscal  the discount rate for the us plans was based on the moody s aa bond index 
similar processes are followed to determine the discount rate for the non us plans 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is reviewed at each measurement date based on the pension plans investments and investment policies  and an analysis of the expected and historical returns of the capital markets  adjusted for current interest rates as appropriate 
our asset allocation targets are to have in equity securities  in debt securities  and in alternate investments 
in determining fiscal periodic pension expense related to the us plans  the expected long term rate of return was decreased to 
we are currently evaluating our portfolio asset allocation targets  which may further impact the expected long term rate of return on assets 
our objective is to shift to a more conservative mix of investments in an attempt to more closely align our pension assets with the expected duration of our pension obligations 
within any given fiscal year  significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets 
the value of plan assets  used in the calculation of pension expense  is determined on a calculated method that recognizes of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method 
gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 
for the us plans  gains and losses are amortized over years 
for the non us plans  if the net gain or loss exceeds of the greater of plan assets or liabilities  a portion is amortized into earnings in the following fiscal year 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed at each measurement date based on the long term estimate of yearly compensation level increases given to employees 
estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost are as follows a basis point change in the discount rates from those used would have changed fiscal pension expense by approximately  a basis point change in the expected rates of return from those used would have changed fiscal pension expense by approximately  and 
table of contents a basis point change in the increase in compensation levels from those used would have changed fiscal pension expense by approximately financial impact of pensions net periodic pension expense was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal pension expense was primarily due to the increase in the discount rates  the impact of restricting entrance into the us plans for employees hired on or after july   and the impact of expected returns associated with a  voluntary contribution to the us plans during fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal pension expense was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rates  partially offset by the decrease in the estimate rate of increase in us compensation levels compared to fiscal as of september   we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of  related to our us plans and  related to our non us plans 
additionally  we had unrecognized prior service costs of  these unrecognized losses are primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rates over the last five years 
at september   the projected benefit obligation exceeded our plan assets by  and  for our us and us plans  respectively 
at september   the accumulated benefit obligation was  and  for our us and us plans  respectively 
when the fair value of pension plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation  an additional minimum liability is recorded in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
as of september  and  shareholders equity includes a minimum liability  net of tax  of  and  respectively 
contributions to the us plans were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
these contributions included voluntary contributions of  and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  in anticipation of future funding requirements 
in fiscal  we expect to contribute approximately  to our us plans in line with our funding requirements 
we may elect to make additional voluntary contributions to the us plans during fiscal contributions to non us plans were  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  we expect to contribute approximately  to our non us plans in line with our funding requirements 
we may elect to make additional voluntary contributions to the non us plans during fiscal effective september   the us plans were frozen and as a result  participants will no longer accrue benefits under these plans 
accordingly  the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated obligation of the us plans will be the same in future periods 
as a result of this event  the us plans were re measured using a discount rate of all other assumptions remaining consistent reflecting the discount rate appropriate as of the date of approval by the company s board of directors 
because this change occurred after the original measurement date we use to measure our pension expense and liabilities  the impact of this change will be recorded during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the freeze and an increase in the discount rate  the amount in which the projected benefit obligation exceeds our plan assets for the us plans will decrease from  to  during the first quarter of fiscal the impact of this freeze should reduce future periodic pension expense  the unfunded status of the us plans  and accordingly  future cash outlays to fund the us plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension plans 
residual values we estimate the residual value of equipment sold under sales type leases 
our residual values are based on the dollar value of the equipment and generally range between to of msrp  depending on the equipment model and lease term 
we evaluate residual values quarterly for impairment 
changes in market conditions could cause actual residual values to differ from estimated values  which could accelerate the write down of the value of the equipment 
as a result of the transactions  this critical accounting policy only affects

fiscal compared to fiscal revenues change change net sales services finance income the decrease in revenues of compared to fiscal  which includes a currency benefit of revenues denominated in foreign currencies impacted favorably when converted to us dollars for reporting purposes  is a result of an overall decrease in finance income as a result of the sales of our north american leasing business and our operating subsidiaries in france and mexico  lower sales of de emphasized technology hardware  lower direct supply sales and lower managed services and customer services revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues as a result of benefits realized from fees received under the us program agreement and the canadian rider compared to fiscal net sales includes revenues from the sale of copiers  printers  multifunction equipment  direct supplies  and technology hardware 
the decrease in net sales includes a currency benefit of 
equipment revenue  which comprises over of our net sales mix  was  and increased by approximately  or  compared to the prior year due mainly to the net impact of the relationship with ge and continued growth from the sale of color equipment 
origination fees and sales of residual value to ge not recognized as revenue when we had captive finance subsidiaries in north america contributed  of incremental equipment revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal european equipment revenues increased by  or  compared to fiscal  due to a currency benefit and consistent with our city expansion strategy in europe 
however  north american equipment sales decreased by  or  due to the impact of competitive pressures and newly introduced black and white models positioned at lower average selling prices  partially offset by the relationship with ge 
in addition  first quarter fiscal north american equipment revenues were impacted by changes in sales coverage and selling processes and sales incentives for our employees  as we launched important long term initiatives in professional services and the integrated selling model 
us revenues generated from the sale of color devices increased by compared to fiscal due to higher demand for these products  particularly higher end color production equipment  as new products were introduced at more affordable prices 
as a percentage of us equipment revenue  color devices increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal us revenues from sales of segment and black and white production equipment devices with page outputs greater than pages per minute decreased approximately compared to fiscal due to continued pricing pressure  a shift to lower end products within this segment  and new alternate products available in segment us placements of segment and black and white production equipment decreased from fiscal us revenues from the sale of segment black and white office equipment devices with page outputs less than pages per minute  fax and other equipment declined approximately compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices as we offered attractive marketing bundles in an effort to increase market share in the mid market customer base as noted by an increase in us placements of segment equipment of approximately from the prior year 
as of september   us revenues from the sale of black and white office equipment 
table of contents represented of the us equipment revenue  compared to in fiscal sales of technology hardware declined by  or  compared to fiscal  as we did not renew several large customer relationships for fiscal as we continue to de emphasize this business 
direct supply sales decreased by approximately  or  compared to the prior year due to lower demand for fax and lower end copier supplies 
in addition  service contracts continue to become more supply inclusive and the revenue related to supplies is recorded as a component of customer services revenue 
services is comprised of enterprise services and other services 
enterprise services consists of managed services  providing on and off site outsourcing services and other expertise  customer services equipment service  and professional services  focusing on integrating hardware and software technologies that capture  manage  control  and store output for customers document lifecycles 
other services includes rental income on operating leases  income from the sharing of gains on certain lease end activities with ge in the us  and fees from ge for providing preferred services for lease generation in the us  the preferred fees 
services increased by  or  which includes a currency benefit of 
managed services revenues of  which includes both on site managed services and lds  decreased by  or 
off site managed services of  which is primarily comprised of lds  a short cycle and increasingly competitive transactional business  declined  or  from fiscal this decline is due mainly to the restructuring actions we took during the second quarter of fiscal  which involved the closure of sites  as well as continued pricing pressure and the impact of a large commercial imaging contract during the first quarter of fiscal  which benefited fiscal revenues by  on site managed services revenues  including facilities management  document production and mailroom operations of  grew from fiscal this was a result of an increase in new contracts and continued expansion to existing contracts 
customer services revenues of  which are significantly impacted by the amount and mix of copy volumes decreased  or  due to lower average revenue per copy and the impact of specific concessions made to customers during the second quarter of fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an overall increase in copy volumes of approximately  driven by a increase in color copy volumes compared to fiscal professional services revenue of  increased  or  over prior year 
total professional services was negatively impacted by the sale of two technology services businesses during the second quarter of fiscal however  professional services revenue from the sale of consulting  network connectivity services  document strategy assessments and various software solutions  increased by  due to the growing demand for document assessment and workflow improvements by our customers 
in fiscal  we will continue to make investments to improve utilization  profitability  and continued growth of professional services 
a significant contribution to the services increase was the impact of fees received as a result of the ge relationship  including preferred fees during fiscal and of  and  respectively  and the related impact of lease end sharing activities 
as a result  the impact of the ge relationship positively impacted services revenue by  during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase can be primarily attributed to the to the fact that fiscal represented the first full year of our ge relationship  as the relationship began in mid fiscal we expect to earn approximately  of preferred fees annually until the initial term of the us program agreement terminates on march  finance income is generated by our leasing subsidiaries as well as certain lease receivables not sold to ge as part of the us transaction 
the decrease in finance income is primarily due to the continued run off of the retained us lease portfolio not sold to ge as part of the us transaction 
in addition  finance income was impacted by the sale of our canadian lease portfolio during the third quarter of fiscal as part of the canadian transaction 
accordingly  lease receivables sold as part of the canadian transaction did not generate finance income for us during fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a currency benefit of 
although we will continue to receive finance income under certain leases that will be financed directly by us  including from our european leasing operations  our total finance income will continue to decrease in future periods as a result of the transactions 

table of contents gross margin gross margin  net sales gross margin  services gross margin  finance income gross margin  total the decrease in gross margin percentage on net sales was primarily due to lower north american equipment margins resulting from competitive pricing and customer incentives and growth in lower margin national accounts program revenues 
this is consistent with our continued market competitiveness coupled with strategic pricing and related marketing promotions to drive placement growth and market share 
the gross margin percentage on services increased compared to the prior year 
customer services gross margin increased due to a lower cost structure as a result of the second quarter of fiscal restructuring actions  partially offset by the impact of specific concessions made to customers during fiscal in addition  the net impact of the ge relationship income from the sharing of gains on certain lease end activities with ge as well as the preferred fees positively impacted the services gross margin by approximately basis points 
the services gross margin percentage during fiscal was negatively impacted by basis points from the completion of a multi year commercial imaging contract in which no profit was earned 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower off site managed services margins compared to prior year due to the impact of lower revenues 
the off site managed services cost structure is less variable than our other lines of business  therefore  gross margin percentages are more heavily influenced by changes in revenue 
as a result of the actions we took late in the second quarter of fiscal to reduce the variability of the cost structure of our off site managed services  we expect profit margin percentages to improve in fiscal the professional services gross margin percentage decreased compared to fiscal due to an increase in staffing levels in advance of an expected increase in demand during the first half of fiscal the gross margin percentage on finance income increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this change is attributable to european leasing revenues becoming a larger part of the finance income mix in fiscal compared to fiscal european leases are leveraged with a lower amount of debt  therefore european leases generate higher profit margins than our sold north american leases 
in addition  there was a lower leverage ratio on the us lease receivable portfolio that we retained after the us transaction 
as a result of our assumption of the public debt of ios capital  llc iosc  our former us leasing subsidiary sold to ge during fiscal the notes due  convertible notes due the convertible note and the notes due  collectively  the additional corporate debt as part of the us transaction  interest on this debt  which was reported in finance interest expense prior to april   is now reported as interest expense 
accordingly  an additional  of interest expense related to the additional corporate debt was recorded during fiscal in interest expense rather than finance interest expense 
as a result  the gross margin on finance income was positively impacted by this change in classification 
selling and administrative expenses change change selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a of revenue selling and administrative expense  which was unfavorably impacted by  due to foreign currency translation compared to the prior year  decreased by  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
the net impact of the transactions of  was a significant factor in the decrease of selling and administrative expense compared to fiscal approximately  of this decrease was due to no lease 
table of contents default expense being required for either retained or sold iosc  lease receivables during fiscal under the terms of the us program agreement  ge assumed substantially all risks related to lease defaults for both the retained and sold lease receivables up to approximately  which we believe is sufficient to cover all reasonably foreseeable defaults for such leases based on historical trends 
the remaining decrease in selling and administrative expense attributable to the transactions was due to the transfer of over employees to ge 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in corporate costs to support the transactions  including headcount and certain infrastructure enhancements 
in addition  fees paid to ge to service our retained us lease portfolio increased by  compared to fiscal included within this increase is the impact of a refund received from ge of approximately  related to administrative fees paid to ge for servicing our retained us lease portfolio during fiscal other selling and administrative expenses other significant changes in selling and administrative expenses impacting the company were a decrease in pension costs of  compared to fiscal  due mainly to the impact of changes in actuarial assumptions 
pension expense is allocated between selling and administrative expense and cost of revenues based on the number of employees related to those areas  a decrease of  in selling compensation and benefit costs due primarily to headcount reductions and a decline in revenues compared to fiscal  an increase of  related to expensing of stock based compensation due to adoption of sfas r share based payment revised sfas r  during fiscal fiscal results did not include any expense related to our stock based compensation plans  a decrease of  compared to fiscal as a result of lower spending for information technology  travel  and other expenses due to discretionary spending reductions during fiscal  partially offset by higher consulting fees from our internal controls certification efforts required by the sarbanes oxley act of  a decrease of  compared to fiscal related to a reduction of real estate facility costs primarily due to the closure of lds sites as a result of the restructuring actions taken during the second quarter of fiscal and the closure and consolidation of other facilities during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as we continue to rationalize our real estate needs  a charge of  incurred during fiscal to terminate several real estate leases during the year  representing both lease termination payments made to lessors as well as future lease payments for sites in which we ceased using the facility  a charge of  for the termination of a consulting contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a charge of  incurred during fiscal related to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita  a charge of  related to changes in certain uk pension liabilities  and during fiscal  we incurred a charge of  related to termination costs of a long term disability plan and incurred a charge of  related to an adverse legal judgment we received on a claim in canada 
in fiscal  we will continue to take aggressive actions to achieve our goal of reducing selling and administrative expense 
we worked toward accomplishing this goal during fiscal through a combination of headcount and real estate reductions  discretionary expense reductions  freezing the us plans and by eliminating unprofitable business lines to streamline our selling and administrative structure

while lower selling prices have fueled increased demand for color and higher volume black and white equipment  the lower end of the black and white equipment market continues to commoditize and remains competitive which caused a negative impact on our margins 
partially offsetting these negative trends was an improved mix of higher margin color equipment revenues and continued benefits realized from the centralization of our supply chain function 
in addition  the net impact of origination fees and sales of equipment residual values to ge positively impacted the net sales gross margin by approximately basis points 
the gross margin percentage on services decreased due to a lower mix of customer services revenues and the impact from the completion of a multi year commercial imaging contract in which no profit was earned 
these decreases were offset by the net impact of the new ge relationship income from the sharing of gains on certain lease end activities with ge as well as the preferred fees  which positively impacted the services gross margin by approximately basis points 
the gross margin percentage on finance income increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to european leasing revenues becoming a larger part of the finance income mix in fiscal compared to fiscal european leases are leveraged with a lower amount of debt  therefore european leases generate higher profit margins than our sold north american leases 
in addition  there was a lower leverage ratio on the us lease receivable portfolio that we retained after the us transaction during the second half of fiscal part of this lower leverage was due to the fact that  of interest expense was recorded in interest expense during fiscal related to debt that was reclassified from non corporate debt to corporate debt beginning on april  as a result  the gross margin on finance income was positively impacted by this change in classification

the remaining decrease in selling and administrative expense as a result of the us transaction was due to the decrease of over employees that were transferred to ge 
partially offsetting the lease default and headcount decreases were increases in fees paid to ge for servicing our retained us lease portfolio of  as well as other corporate costs to support the us transaction including headcount and certain infrastructure enhancements
