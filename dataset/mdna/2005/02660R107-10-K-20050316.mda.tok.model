item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following accounting policies that are critical to the presentation of our financial statements and that require critical accounting estimates by management 
mortgage backed securities we record our mortgage backed securities at fair value 
the fair values of our mortgage backed securities are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets on these financial instruments 
if the fair value of a mortgage backed security is not reasonably available  management estimates the fair value  which requires management s judgment and may not be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or aggregate market value 
for mortgage loans held for sale that are hedged with forward sale commitments  the carrying value is adjusted for the change in market during the time the hedge was deemed to be highly effective 
the market value is determined by outstanding commitments from investors or current yield requirements calculated on an aggregate basis 
mortgage servicing rights msrs when we acquire servicing assets through either purchase or origination of loans and sell or securitize those loans with servicing assets retained  the total cost of the loans is allocated to the servicing assets and the loans without the servicing assets based on their relative fair values 
the amount attributable to the servicing assets is capitalized as msrs on the consolidated balance sheets 
the msrs are amortized to expense in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
the msrs are assessed for impairment based on the fair value of those assets 
we estimate the fair value of the servicing assets by obtaining market information from a primary msr broker 
when the book value of capitalized servicing assets exceeds their fair value  impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance 
in determining impairment  the mortgage servicing portfolio is stratified by the predominant risk characteristic of the underlying mortgage loans 
we have determined that the predominant risk characteristic is the interest rate on the underlying loan 
we measure impairment for each stratum by comparing the estimated fair value to the recorded book value 
temporary impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance and amortization expense in the period of occurrence 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our msrs for other than temporary impairment to determine if the carrying value before the application of the valuation allowance is recoverable 
we receive a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of our msrs assuming a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates from an independent msr broker 
the fair value estimate includes changes in market assumptions that would be expected given the increase in mortgage rates eg  prepayment speeds would be lower 
we believe this basis point increase in mortgage rates to be an appropriate threshold for determining the recoverability of the temporary impairment because that size rate increase is foreseeable and consistent with historical mortgage rate fluctuations 
when using this instantaneous change in rates  if the fair value of the strata of msrs is estimated to increase to a point where all of the impairment would be recovered  the impairment is considered to be temporary 
when we determine that a portion of the msrs is not recoverable  the related msrs and the previously established valuation allowance are correspondingly reduced to reflect other than temporary impairment 
derivative assets and derivative liabilities our mortgage committed pipeline includes interest rate lock commitments irlcs that have been extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
irlcs associated with loans expected to be sold are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
the fair value of the irlcs initiated on or before march  is determined by an estimate of the ultimate gain on sale of the loans  including the value of msrs  net of estimated net costs remaining to originate the loan and any net deferred origination costs 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which provides industry guidance which changed the timing of recognition of msrs for irlcs initiated after march  in sab no 
 the sec stated that the value of expected future cash flows related to servicing rights should be excluded when determining the fair value of derivative irlcs 
under the new policy  the value of the expected future cash flows related to servicing rights is not recognized until the underlying loans are sold 
we use other derivative instruments  including mortgage forward delivery contracts and treasury futures options  to economically hedge the irlcs  which are also classified and accounted for as free standing derivatives and thus are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
we use mortgage forward delivery contracts designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge of our agency eligible conforming fixed rate loans and most of our non conforming fixed rate loans held for sale 
at the inception of the hedge  we formally document the relationship between the forward delivery contracts and the mortgage inventory  as well as our objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions 
in the case of our conventional conforming fixed rate loan products  the notional amount of the forward delivery contracts  along with the underlying rate and terms of the contracts  are equivalent to the unpaid principal amount of the mortgage inventory being hedged  hence  the forward delivery contracts effectively fix the forward sales price and thereby substantially eliminate interest rate and price risk to us 
we classify and account for these forward delivery contracts as fair value hedges 
the derivatives are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
when the hedges are deemed to be highly effective  the book value of the hedged loans held for sale is adjusted for its change in fair value during the hedge period 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure when financing our adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
certain swap agreements accounted for as cash flow hedges and certain swap agreements not designated as cash flow hedges are both carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our swap agreements are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets in these financial instruments or third party pricing services 
if the fair value of an interest rate swap agreement is not reasonably available  management estimates the fair value  which requires management s judgment and may not be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets stemming from business acquisitions  including identifiable intangibles 
we test for impairment  at least annually  by comparing the fair value of goodwill  as determined by using a discounted cash flow method  with its carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss in continuing operations 
the discounted cash flow calculation related to our loan origination segment includes a forecast of the expected future loan originations and the related revenues and expenses 
the discounted cash flow calculation related to our mortgage backed securities holdings segment includes a forecast of the expected future net interest income  gain on mortgage backed securities and the related revenues and expenses 
these cash flows are discounted using a rate that is estimated to be a weighted average cost of capital for similar companies 
we further test to ensure that the fair value of all our business units does not exceed our total market capitalization

loan originations in  our primary business was the origination and sale of primarily one to four family residential mortgage loans 
our origination segment grew significantly in both organically and through acquisitions 
the historically low interest rates of resulted in record loan originations industry wide as record numbers of borrowers refinanced their mortgages and purchased new homes 
during  we acquired retail branches of prm and the retail and wholesale branches of american mortgage llc  and also hired former employees of capitol commerce mortgage company 
total loan originations for were billion compared to billion for  a increase 
at december   the segment had loan origination offices and  employees  compared to loan origination offices and  employees at december  liquidity and capital resources we have arrangements to enter into reverse repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with thirteen different financial institutions and on december  had borrowed funds from nine of these firms 
because we borrow money under these agreements based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities  and because changes in interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of mortgage backed securities  our borrowing ability under these agreements could be limited and lenders could initiate margin calls in the event interest rates change or the value of our mortgage backed securities declines for other reasons 
as of december   we had billion of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding with a weighted average borrowing rate of before the impact of interest rate swaps and a weighted average remaining maturity of months 
to originate a mortgage loan  we draw against a billion secured liquidity note program  a billion pre purchase facility with ubs real estate securities inc ubs  a million bank syndicated facility led by bank of america which includes a million term loan facility which we use to finance our msrs  a million facility with cdc mortgage capital inc cdc  a facility of million with morgan stanley bank morgan stanley  a facility of million with lehman brothers  a facility of million with bear stearns and a facility of million with calyon americas 
in addition  we have a gestation facility with greenwich capital financial products  inc greenwich 
these facilities are secured by the mortgages owned by us and by certain of our other assets 
advances drawn under the facilities bear interest at rates that vary depending on the type of mortgages securing the advances 
these loans are subject to sublimits  advance rates and terms that vary depending on the type of securing mortgages and the ratio of our liabilities to our tangible net worth 
at march   the aggregate outstanding balance under the warehouse facilities was approximately billion  the aggregate outstanding balance in drafts payable was approximately million and the aggregate maximum amount available for additional borrowings was approximately billion 
the documents governing our warehouse facilities contain a number of compensating balance requirements and restrictive financial and other covenants that  among other things  require us to adhere to a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth and liquidity  as well as to comply with applicable regulatory and investor requirements 
the facility agreements also contain covenants limiting the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer or sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business and to create liens on the collateral without obtaining the prior consent of the lenders  which consent may not be unreasonably withheld 
in addition  under our warehouse facilities  we cannot continue to finance a mortgage loan that we hold if o the loan is rejected as unsatisfactory for purchase by the ultimate investor and has exceeded its permissible day warehouse period  o we fail to deliver the applicable mortgage note or other documents evidencing the loan within the requisite time period  o the underlying property that secures the loan has sustained a casualty loss in excess of of its appraised value  or o the loan ceases to be an eligible loan as determined pursuant to the applicable warehousing agreement 
as of december   our aggregate warehouse facility borrowings were million including million of borrowings under a working capital sub limit and our outstanding drafts payable were million  compared to billion including million of borrowings under a working capital sub limit and our outstanding drafts payable were million as of december  at december   our loans held for sale were billion compared to billion at december  in addition to the ubs  cdc  bank of america  morgan stanley  and calyon americas warehouse facilities  we have purchase and sale agreements with ubs and greenwich 
these agreements allow us to accelerate the sale of our mortgage loan inventory  resulting in a more effective use of the warehouse facilities 
amounts sold and being held under these agreements at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the amounts so held under these agreements at march  were million 
these agreements are not committed facilities and may be terminated at the discretion of the counterparty 
we make certain representations and warranties under the purchase and sale agreements regarding  among other things  the loans compliance with laws and regulations  their conformity with the ultimate investors underwriting standards and the accuracy of information 
in the event of a breach of these representations or warranties or in the event of an early payment default  we may be required to repurchase the loans and indemnify the investor for damages caused by that breach 
we have implemented strict procedures to ensure quality control and conformity to underwriting standards and minimize the risk of being required to repurchase loans 
from time to time we have been required to repurchase loans that we sold  however  the liability for the fair value of those obligations has been immaterial 
we also have a million term loan facility with a bank syndicate led by bank of america which we use to finance our msrs 
the term loan facility expires on december  interest is based on a spread to the libor and may be adjusted for earnings on escrow balances 
at december  and december   borrowings under our term loan facility were million and million  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   from million at december  our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in reverse repurchase agreements  o million increase commercial paper  and o million proceeds from issuance of common stock 
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in mortgage backed securities  o million net decrease in warehouse lines of credit  and o million decrease in payable for mortgage backed securities purchased 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   from million at december  our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in reverse repurchase agreements  o million increase in warehouse lines of credit  and o million increase in payable for mortgage backed securities purchased 
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in mortgage backed securities  and o million net increase in mortgage loans held for sale 
our ability to originate loans depends in large part on our ability to sell these mortgage loans at par or for a premium in the secondary market so that we may generate cash proceeds to repay borrowings under our warehouse facilities 
the value of our loans depends on a number of factors  including  but not limited to o interest rates on our loans compared to market interest rates  o the borrower credit risk classification  o loan to value ratios  and o general economic conditions 
inflation for the period to  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
to the extent inflation increases in the future  interest rates will also likely rise  which would reduce the number of loans we originate 
such a reduction would adversely affect our future results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are reasonably likely to be material to investors 
contractual obligations we had the following contractual obligations excluding derivative financial instruments at december  total less than year years years after years in thousands warehouse liabilities   operating leases      notes payable    commercial paper   reverse repurchase agreements   risk management movements in interest rates can pose a major risk to us in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
we depend on substantial borrowings to conduct our business 
these borrowings are all done at variable interest rate terms which will increase as short term interest rates rise 
additionally  when interest rates rise  loans held for sale and any applications in process with locked in rates decrease in value 
to preserve the value of such fixed rate loans or applications in process with locked in rates  agreements are executed for mandatory loan sales to be settled at future dates with fixed prices 
these sales take the form of forward sales of mortgage backed securities 
when interest rates decline  fallout may occur as a result of customers withdrawing their applications 
in those instances  we may be required to purchase loans at current market prices to fulfill existing mandatory loan sale agreements  thereby incurring losses upon sale 
we use an interest rate hedging program to manage these risks 
through this program  mortgage backed securities are purchased and sold forward and options are acquired on treasury futures contracts 
in the event that we do not deliver into the forward delivery commitments or exercise our option contracts  the instruments can be settled on a net basis 
net settlement entails paying or receiving cash based upon the change in market value of the existing instrument 
all forward delivery commitments and option contracts to buy securities are to be contractually settled within nine months of the balance sheet date 
our hedging program contains an element of risk because the counterparties to our mortgage and treasury securities transactions may be unable to meet their obligations 
while we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty  we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event the counterparty fails to perform 
our exposure to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty is the difference between the contract and the current market price 
we minimize our credit risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to well capitalized banks and securities dealers who meet established credit and capital guidelines 
movements in interest rates also impact the value of msrs 
when interest rates decline  the loans underlying the msrs are generally expected to prepay faster  which reduces the market value of the msrs 
we consider the expected increase in loan origination volumes and the resulting additional origination related income as a natural hedge against the expected change in the value of msrs 
lower mortgage rates generally reduce the fair value of the msrs  as increased prepayment speeds are highly correlated with lower levels of mortgage interest rates 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure when financing our arm loans and our mortgage backed securities 
we generally borrow money based on short term interest rates  by entering into borrowings with maturity terms of less than one year  and frequently nine to twelve months 
our arm loans and mortgage backed securities financing vehicles generally have an interest rate that reprices based on frequency terms of one to twelve months 
our mortgage backed securities have an initial fixed interest rate period of three to five years 
when we enter into a swap agreement  we generally agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and to receive a variable interest rate  generally based on the libor 
these swap agreements have the effect of converting our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt over the life of the swap agreements 
these instruments are used as a cost effective way to lengthen the average repricing period of our variable rate and short term borrowings such that the average repricing of the borrowings more closely matches the average repricing of our mortgage backed securities 
our duration gap was years as of december  the following tables summarize our interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  and december  december  carrying estimated amount fair value assets mortgage backed securities   derivative assets   mortgage loans held for sale  net   mortgage servicing rights  net   liabilities reverse repurchase agreements   derivative liabilities   december  carrying estimated amount fair value assets mortgage backed securities   derivative assets   mortgage loans held for sale  net   mortgage servicing rights  net   liabilities reverse repurchase agreements   derivative liabilities   derivative assets includes interest rate lock commitments irlcs to fund mortgage loans

the fair value includes the value of msrs 
management s fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on present value or other valuation techniques 
these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimates of future cash flows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies 
a further discussion of the methods and assumptions we use to estimate the above financial instruments is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements
