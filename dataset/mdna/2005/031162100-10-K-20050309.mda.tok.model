overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding amgen 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we are a global biotechnology company that discovers  develops  manufactures  and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
as a science based  patient focused organization  we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat serious illness 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of nephrology  supportive cancer care  and inflammatory disease 
for the year ended december   total revenues were  million and net income was  million  or per share 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  million 
for the years ended december    and  product sales represented   and of total revenues  respectively 
over the last two years  our product sales growth has been primarily driven by sales of aranesp  enbrel  and neulasta  which benefited from market share gains and or market growth 
we expect these products to continue to drive sales growth in the near term 
most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications  excluding enbrel  are covered by both government and private payers health care programs 
therefore  our product sales are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies 
reduction in reimbursement could adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  the mma was enacted into law in december we expect that  beginning in 
table of contents  reimbursement changes resulting from the mma are likely  to a degree  to negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products 
for additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business  see reimbursement in item business 
although we have achieved market share gains during  we expect that continued gains will be a challenge as we operate in a highly competitive environment 
going forward  we expect to continue to focus on market share gains  but we also expect to increase our focus on growing the market 
see competition in item business for further information on the impact of competition on our business 
international product sales for the years ended december    and represented   and of total product sales and consisted principally of european sales 
international product sales have grown substantially since as a result of the launches of aranesp and neulasta and continued market penetration 
international product sales grew during and during our international sales are impacted by foreign currency changes see results of operations discussion below 
international product sales growth during and benefited by million and million  respectively  from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
however  both positive and negative impacts from movements in foreign exchange rates have been mitigated by the natural  opposite impact to our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income 
as such  the impact to our results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated 
for  operating income increased million primarily as a result of our product sales growth 
operating income as a percentage of product sales was for compared to for this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the ipr d charge of million relating to the acquisition of tularik 
during  we increased our operating expenses to support our product sales growth and to invest in r d to advance our product pipeline 
in  our operating expenses are expected to further increase in support of our anticipated product sales growth  and as a result of our continued investment in r d to advance our pipeline 
we focus our r d efforts on human therapeutics delivered in the form of proteins  monoclonal antibodies  and small molecules in the areas of oncology  inflammation  metabolic disorders  neuroscience  and general medicine 
we focus on the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness 
we take a modality independent approach to r d that is  we identify targets  then choose the modality best suited to address a specific target 
to enhance our internal r d efforts  we have acquired and licensed certain product and technology rights and have established r d collaborations 
on august   we acquired tularik at a purchase price of approximately billion in a transaction accounted for as a business combination 
tularik was a company engaged in drug discovery related to cell signaling and the control of gene expression 
in connection with the tularik acquisition  we incurred a charge of million associated with writing off the fair value of ipr d acquired see note  acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements 
the ipr d write off represents the estimated fair value of the various acquired r d projects in tularik s pipeline that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
see research and development and selected product candidates in item business for further information on our product pipeline 
we expect to continue to invest significantly in r d 
there are many economic and industry wide factors that affect our business  including  among others  those relating to broad reimbursement changes  increased complexity and cost of r d  increasingly intense competition for our currently marketed products and product candidates  complex and expanding regulatory requirements  and intellectual property protection 
see item business and factors that may affect amgen for further information on these economic and industry wide factors and their impact on our business 

table of contents results of operations product sales for the years ended december    and  total product sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change total us total international total product sales see principal products in item business for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications 
product sales are influenced by a number of factors  including demand  third party reimbursement availability and policies  pricing strategies  wholesaler inventory management practices  foreign currency exchange effects  new product launches and indications  competitive products  product supply  and acquisitions 
sales growth in was principally driven by demand for aranesp  enbrel  and neulasta 
us sales for aranesp and neulasta were impacted by higher incentives earned by customers under performance based contracts 
international product sales growth benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
in the near term  we expect sales growth to continue to be driven primarily by aranesp  enbrel  and neulasta 
we believe that changes in reimbursement for our products are likely to adversely affect  to a degree  the prescription and administration of our products by healthcare providers  impacting sequential sales growth and historical sales trends 
in prior years  certain of our products have reported sales in the first quarter that were comparable or slightly less than reported sales in the fourth quarter of the previous year 
however  due to the uncertainties surrounding the impact of reimbursement  we are unsure that such historical sales trends will continue 
epogen aranesp for the years ended december    and  total epogen and aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change epogen us aranesp us aranesp international aranesp total total epogen and aranesp the increases in combined epogen and worldwide aranesp sales for the years ended december  and were primarily driven by worldwide demand for aranesp 
the increase for the year ended december  reflects the mid year approval of aranesp for the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia in the united states and europe 
the growth in reported epogen sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by demand  which reflects dialysis patient population growth and a continued focus in the renal community on patient outcomes  and to a lesser extent  increases in wholesaler inventory levels 
for the year ended december   the growth in reported epogen sales was primarily due to demand  and to a lesser extent  spillover see summary of critical accounting policies epogen revenue recognition and note  summary of significant accounting policies product sales to the consolidated financial statements 
demand was driven by growth in the dialysis patient population and improved patient outcomes 

table of contents patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with epogen are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
we believe epogen sales growth will primarily depend on dialysis patient population growth and changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government see factors that may affect amgen our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products 
we believe epogen sales growth will also be dependent  in part  on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products and cost containment pressures from the federal government on health care providers 
further  epogen competes to a slight degree with aranesp in the united states as some health care providers use aranesp to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of epogen 
to the extent that future aranesp sales in the united states are impacted by the effects of reimbursement and pricing strategies see aranesp below  we would expect further competition between epogen and aranesp for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure for patients who are on dialysis 
the increase in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  was driven by demand  which benefited from market share gains in both oncology and nephrology and market growth 
sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance based contracts 
the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was principally driven by demand  and to a lesser extent  favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international aranesp sales growth for benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the increase in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  was principally driven by demand  reflecting the mid year launch of aranesp for the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia in the united states 
the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was principally driven by demand  reflecting the mid year launch of aranesp for the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia in europe  and to a lesser extent  favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international aranesp sales growth for benefited by million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe future worldwide aranesp sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payers including governments and private insurance plans see factors that may affect amgen our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products  cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers  governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  penetration of new and existing markets  patient population growth  the effects of pricing strategies  competitive products or therapies  including follow on biologic products in europe  the development of new treatments for cancer  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
neulasta neupogen for the years ended december    and  total neulasta and neupogen sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change neulasta us neulasta international n a neulasta total neupogen us neupogen international neupogen total total neulasta and neupogen 
table of contents the increase in combined worldwide neulasta and neupogen sales for the years ended december  and was driven by worldwide demand for neulasta 
the increase for the year ended december  reflects the april launch of neulasta 
the increase in us neulasta sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by demand  which benefited from new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use 
sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance based contracts 
the increase in international neulasta sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to demand  which reflects continued market penetration since the january launch of neulasta in europe  and to a lesser extent  favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international neulasta sales growth for benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the increase in us neulasta sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by us demand  which reflects the conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta resulting from the april neulasta launch 
international neulasta sales for the year ended december  reflect the january launch of neulasta in europe 
the decrease in us neupogen sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decline in demand 
the increase in international neupogen sales for the year ended december  was due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by a decline in demand 
international neupogen sales growth for benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
both the united states and international decreases in demand reflect the conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta 
the decrease in neupogen sales in the united states for the year ended december  was principally due to the conversion of patients from neupogen to neulasta 
the increase in international neupogen sales for the year ended december  was entirely due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe future worldwide neulasta and neupogen sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payers including governments and private insurance plans see factors that may affect amgen our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products  cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers  governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  penetration of existing markets  patient population growth  the effects of pricing strategies  competitive products or therapies  including follow on biologic products in europe  the development of new treatments for cancer  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less neulasta neupogen  however  other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive  such as dose dense chemotherapy  could require more neulasta neupogen 
neupogen competes with neulasta in the united states and europe 
us neupogen sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to neulasta 
however  we believe that most of the conversion in the united states has occurred 
we believe that we are experiencing conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta in europe  but we believe that this conversion will occur to a lesser extent than that experienced in the united states 
however  we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta in europe 
enbrel for the years ended december    and  total enbrel sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change enbrel us enbrel international total enbrel 
table of contents enbrel sales growth for the year ended december  was driven by demand  benefiting from enbrel s competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in the rheumatology and dermatology markets 
in the dermatology market  enbrel has grown significantly since its approval for moderate to severe psoriasis in april of and has become the number one prescribed systemic therapy in this market 
enbrel sales for the year ended december  were primarily driven by the addition of new patients in both rheumatology and dermatology 
the increase from the prior year reflects that we only recorded enbrel sales beginning on july   subsequent to the close of the immunex acquisition 
these sales were adversely impacted by supply constraints 
we believe that future enbrel sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as the effects of competing products or therapies  penetration of existing and new markets  including potential new indications  the availability and extent of reimbursement by government and third party payers  governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products see factors that may affect amgen our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products  and limits on the current supply of and sources of enbrel 
selected operating expenses the following table summarizes selected operating expenses for the years ended december    and amounts in millions product sales operating expenses cost of sales excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets of product sales research and development of product sales write off of acquired in process research and development selling  general and administrative of product sales cost of sales cost of sales  which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets see consolidated statements of operations  increased for the year ended december   primarily driven by higher sales volumes  and to a lesser extent  higher manufacturing costs due to changes in the product mix 
in  we expect cost of sales to be affected by further product mix changes  including the impact of higher enbrel sales as it has significantly higher manufacturing costs and royalty expenses as compared to our other principal products 
cost of sales for the year ended december  increased over the prior year  primarily due to higher sales 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales in primarily reflects an increase of enbrel sales as a percentage of total product sales 
enbrel has significantly higher manufacturing costs and royalty expense compared to our other products 
additionally  the manufacturing costs of the rhode island production facility  which began producing in december  are greater than those of our contract manufacturer  bi pharma 
research and development r d expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with r d personnel  overhead and occupancy costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
r d expenses increased for the year ended december   primarily driven by higher staff related costs including the addition of r d personnel from tularik  and to a lesser extent  higher costs relating to clinical manufacturing and key clinical trials costs  including the commencement of large scale 
table of contents phase trials for amg  amgen s investigational therapy for bone loss 
in  staff related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we expect our r d expenses to increase primarily due to higher clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs to support our development efforts for amg and aranesp treat see item business research and development and selected product candidates 
in  r d expenses increased over the prior year  primarily due to higher outside r d costs  principally licensing and milestone fees which include the biovitrum ab up front fee of million  higher staff related costs  and higher clinical manufacturing costs

sg a increased for the year ended december   primarily due to higher staff related costs and higher outside marketing expenses  which reflects higher spending to support our products in competitive markets and sales growth 
outside marketing expenses include the wyeth profit share related to enbrel  which has increased due to enbrel sales growth 
in  staff related costs and outside marketing expenses increased approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we expect higher wyeth profit share expense due to expected enbrel sales growth  however  we expect to see some leveraging of our sg a spending during additionally  sg a expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to increase over the previous three quarters in a trend similar to that which has occurred in previous years 
in  sg a expenses increased  over the prior year primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses  which includes higher wyeth profit share as a result of enbrel sales growth  and higher staff related costs to support new products in competitive markets and sales growth

see note  other items  net  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes our effective tax rate was   and for   and respectively 
our effective tax rate for has increased primarily due to the write off of non deductible ipr d costs of million in connection with the acquisition of tularik 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 

table of contents our negative effective tax rate for was due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of non deductible ipr d costs of  million in connection with the acquisition of immunex 
the effective tax rate was higher than the effective tax rate primarily due to immunex ipr d write off in and the loss of the possession tax credit in partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
during  we restructured our puerto rico manufacturing operations using a controlled foreign corporation 
as permitted in accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  we do not provide us income taxes on our controlled foreign corporations undistributed earnings that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  which provides a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings 
however  uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the jobs act 
as such  we are currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and our results of operations do not reflect any impact relating to such repatriation provisions 
see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock option expense in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will require us to account for our stock options using a fair value based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements 
we currently account for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  which generally results in no employee stock option expense 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified retrospective transition method on july  and do not plan to restate our financial statements for periods ending prior to january  we expect that our after tax expense for stock options for the full twelve months in will range between million to million  or to per share 
the estimated after tax expense for is less than the corresponding pro forma expense amount for million  see note  summary of significant accounting policies employee stock options in the consolidated financial statements principally due to a reduction in the estimated number of stock options to be granted in and a reduction in the estimated fair value of our stock options  which is primarily due to a lower estimated future volatility of our stock price  reflecting the consideration of implied volatility in our publicly traded equity instruments 
however  the actual annual expense in is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted  our common stock price and related expected volatility  and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant 
accordingly  the adoption in of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our results of operations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes selected financial data amounts in millions december  december  cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities total assets current debt non current debt stockholders equity we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  as well as to support our stock repurchase programs 
however  in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity  we may raise additional capital from time to time 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of the total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at december   approximately billion represents cash generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the united states see results of operations income taxes 
if these funds are repatriated for use in our us operations  additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid 
based on our preliminary analysis to date  we are limited under the jobs act to repatriate up to million in foreign profits to take advantage of the dividends received deduction 
the primary objectives for our marketable securities portfolio  which is primarily comprised of fixed income investments  is liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
financing activities as of december   we had convertible notes year  zero coupon senior convertible notes with an accreted value of billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of billion and yield to maturity of 
the original issue discount of billion is being accreted to the balance of the convertible notes and recognized as interest expense over the life of the convertible notes using the effective interest method 
the holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on various dates  the earliest of which is march   at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount accreted value through the purchase dates 
in such event  under the terms of the convertible notes  we have the right to pay the purchase price in cash and or shares of common stock  which would be issued at the then current market price 
on march   as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their march  put option  we repurchased  million  or approximately  of the outstanding convertible notes at their then accreted value for cash 
concurrently  we amended the terms of the convertible notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders  at their option  to cause us to repurchase the convertible notes on march  at the then accreted value 
accordingly  the portion of the convertible notes outstanding at december  not repurchased on march  was classified as long term debt see note  financing arrangements convertible notes to the consolidated financial statements

the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales 
this increase was partially offset primarily by the timing of cash payments relating to our tax liabilities see consolidated statements of cash flows 
investing capital expenditures totaled  million in compared with  million in the prior year 
capital expenditures in primarily related to the thousand oaks site expansion  the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island  and the puerto rico manufacturing expansion 
capital expenditures in primarily related to the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island  the puerto rico manufacturing expansion  and the seattle research center which was completed in january we currently estimate spending on capital projects and equipment to be consistent with the most significant of these expenditures are expected to relate to the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island  the puerto rico manufacturing expansion  and the thousand oaks site expansion 
financing in december  the board of directors the board authorized us to repurchase up to billion of common stock 
additionally  in december  the board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional billion of common stock 
as of december    million was available for stock repurchases 
the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased varies based on a variety of factors including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties contingent upon certain future events 
such events could include  but are not limited to  development milestones  regulatory approvals and product sales 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the long term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the convertible notes and the inclusion of future interest payments

holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as march  at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount accreted value through the purchase dates 
on march   as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their march  put option  we repurchased  million  or approximately  of the outstanding convertible notes at their then accreted value for cash 
concurrently  we amended the terms of the convertible notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders  at their option  to cause us to repurchase the convertible notes on march  at the then accreted value 
the amounts above reflect the convertible notes accreted value repurchased on march  and the remaining convertible notes accreted value on march   the next put date 
in the event 
table of contents we are required to repurchase the remaining convertible notes  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and or shares of common stock  which would be issued at the then current market price 
see note  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes 
purchase obligations primarily relate to our long term supply agreement with bi pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of enbrel  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for enbrel and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved  r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  capital expenditures which primarily relate to the thousand oaks site expansion  the new rhode island manufacturing plant  and the puerto rico manufacturing expansion  and open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product sales  sales incentives and returns sales of our products other than epogen see epogen revenue recognition below are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
this typically occurs at the time products are shipped to the customer  generally a wholesale distributor 
in the united states  we utilize these wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics  hospitals  and pharmacies 
products we sell outside the united states are principally distributed to hospitals and or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third party data  and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns 
accruals for estimated rebates including medicaid  wholesaler chargebacks  discounts  and other incentives collectively sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales 
sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data  and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales incentives are product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following amounts in millions rebates wholesaler chargebacks discounts and other incentives total sales incentives rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics  hospitals and pharmacies in the united states are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate 
these rebates are performance based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth 
as a result  the calculation of 
table of contents the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate s to be earned over a contractual period 
these rebates totaled  million in and million in we believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
for example  a percent change in the revenue reduction attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an approximate million effect on our reported product sales in wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relates to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers 
these chargebacks from wholesalers totaled  million in and million in accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability 
amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results 
however  such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
the following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives amounts in millions balance at amounts balance at beginning charged against end of of period product sales payments period year ended december  year ended december  includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates 
such amounts represented less than of amounts charged against product sales for both and accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales 
returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate 
historically  sales returns have been insignificant  amounting to approximately of gross product sales 
epogen revenue recognition we have the exclusive right to sell epoetin alfa for dialysis  certain diagnostics  and all non human  non research uses in the united states 
we granted to johnson johnson a license relating to epoetin alfa for sales in the united states for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics 
pursuant to this license  amgen and johnson johnson are required to compensate each other for epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party s exclusive market  sometimes referred to as spillover 
accordingly  we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of johnson johnson and do recognize the product sales made by johnson johnson into our exclusive market 
sales in our exclusive market are derived from our sales to our customers  as adjusted for spillover 
we are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party s spillover based on independent third party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage 
data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques  and accordingly  the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover 
we initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage  utilizing historical third party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third party data as received 
differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized epogen sales 
however  such differences to date have not been material 

table of contents deferred income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on our projected cash flow  working capital  and long term investment requirements of our us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate 
the jobs act provides a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings 
however  we are currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the jobs act  as there is uncertainty as to how to interpret many of its provisions 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various types of legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  tax claims  and governmental investigations 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in item legal proceedings 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 
our income tax returns are routinely audited by the internal revenue service and various state and foreign tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
while we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
while it is not possible to predict accurately or determine the eventual outcome of these matters  we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution in any quarterly reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
tularik purchase price allocation the purchase price for tularik was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
an independent third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of various research and development projects and technologies in turlarik s pipeline that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
this valuation required the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon reasonable assumptions given current available facts and circumstances 
however  certain estimates for the purchase price allocation may change due to unanticipated events and as subsequent information becomes available 
factors that may affect amgen the following items are representative of the risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 

table of contents our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products are dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers such as state and federal governments  under programs such as medicare and medicaid in the united states  and private insurance plans 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls 
in the united states  there have been  there are  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal laws and or regulations  or in some cases draft legislation or regulations that could limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of pharmaceutical and biologic products 
for example  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act or the medicare modernization act mma was enacted into law in december in addition  we believe that private insurers  such as managed care organizations  may adopt their own reimbursement reductions in response to legislation or regulations  including  without limitation  the mma 
however  we believe that private payers ability to fully implement reimbursement mechanisms in alignment with government legislation or regulations is limited 
for example  we are aware of a few private payers who have adopted an average sales price methodology similar in structure to that of the mma 
however  the reimbursement rates based on such methodology are substantially greater than those under the current mma reimbursement rates 
we expect that  beginning in  reimbursement changes resulting from the mma are likely  to a degree  to negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products 
the main components of the mma that affect our currently marketed products are as follows through the average wholesale price awp mechanism was the basis of medicare part b payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologics 
effective january   in the physician clinic market segment  aranesp  neulasta and neupogen will be reimbursed under a new medicare part b system that reimburses each product at of its average sales price asp sometimes referred to as asp 
on november   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms released final rules for revisions to payment policies under the physician fee schedule for cms then calculated each of amgen s product s asps based on data submissions from us 
asps will remain in effect for one quarter and will be updated quarterly thereafter 
the reimbursement rates for aranesp  neulasta  and neupogen calculated at of the asps and initially based on third quarter company data  are lower than our reimbursement rates as the asp methodology incorporates sales incentives offered to healthcare providers 
per the mma  effective january   physicians in this market segment will have the choice under the competitive acquisition program cap between purchasing and billing for drugs under the asp system or obtaining drugs from vendors selected by cms via a competitive bidding process 
the medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps  which determines payment rates for specified covered outpatient drugs and biologics in the hospital outpatient setting  will continue to utilize awp as the basis for reimbursement in on november   cms issued a final rule for the reimbursement of aranesp in under this final rule  as in and  cms continued the application of an equitable adjustment such that the aranesp reimbursement rate for is based on the awp of procrit 
for the reimbursement rate for aranesp is of the awp for procrit  down from of the awp for procrit in  with a dose conversion ratio of u procrit to mcg aranesp  the same ratio as effective january   the opps system will change from an awp based reimbursement system to a system based on average acquisition cost 
this change will affect aranesp  neulasta and neupogen when administered in the hospital outpatient setting 
although we do not know how cms will define the opps average acquisition cost  it is possible that cms could link acquisition cost to asp  which could lower the reimbursement rate 
pursuant to final rules issued by cms on november   medicare reimbursement for epogen used in the dialysis setting for calendar year has been changed from the previous rate of per  units to per  units  a rate based upon an average acquisition cost for determined by the office of the inspector general oig and adjusted for price inflation based on the producer price index for pharmaceutical products 
pursuant to the cms final rules  the difference between the 
table of contents reimbursement rates for all drugs separately billed outside the dialysis composite rate including epogen and the reimbursement rates for such drugs will be added to the composite rate that dialysis providers receive for dialysis treatment 
again in  the epogen rate may change  as the mma provided for discretion in either continuing to pay for these separately reimbursed dialysis drugs at acquisition cost  or switching to an asp based system 
the payment rate for dialysis drugs not studied by the oig  including aranesp  will be asp 
we believe these changes driven by the mma are lowering the reimbursement rate for all areas in which cms provides reimbursement for epogen  aranesp  neulasta and neupogen 
however  because we cannot predict the impact of any such changes on how  or under what circumstances  healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products  as of the date of this filing  we cannot predict the full impact of the mma on our business  however  it is likely to be  to a degree  negative 
in addition  on july   cms released a proposed revision to the hematocrit measurement audit program memorandum hma pm  a medicare payment review mechanism used by cms to audit epogen utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients 
as of the date of this filing  the comment period for the proposed revision has expired and no final program memorandum has been issued 
the proposed policy would not permit reimbursement for epogen in the following circumstances without medical justification epogen doses greater than  units per month in a patient with a hemoglobin greater than grams per deciliter or doses greater than  units per month in a patient with hemoglobin greater than grams per deciliter 
if the proposed revision  which has not yet been finalized  is adopted as the final form  it could result in a reduction in utilization of epogen 
although the proposed revision was scheduled to go into effect as early as january   it is unclear as to when it may be implemented 
amgen and the dialysis community have provided public comment based on data analysis suggesting that revision to the proposed policy is unwarranted 
given the importance of epogen utilization for maintaining the quality of care for dialysis patients  the precise impact of such a change on provider utilization remains unclear 
if  and when  reimbursement rates or availability for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our current or future products  health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them  which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products 
this could result in lower product sales or revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
for example  in the united states the use of epogen in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the us federal government 
in early  cms  formerly known as healthcare financing administration hcfa  instituted a reimbursement change for epogen  which materially and adversely affected our epogen sales until the policies were revised 
also  we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may adversely impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic product is approved  the governmental and or private coverage and reimbursement for that product is uncertain 
we cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates  including those at a late stage of development  and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time 
sales of all our products are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies 
reduction in reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval 
we and certain of our licensors and partners conduct research  preclinical testing  and clinical trials for our product candidates 
in addition  we manufacture and contract manufacture and certain of our licensors and partners manufacture our product candidates 
we also manufacture and contract manufacture  price  sell  distribute  and market or co market our products for their approved indications 
these activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the united states  such as the fda and cms  as well as in foreign countries  including europe 
currently  we are required in the united states and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries regulatory authorities before we can manufacture or have our third party manufacturers produce product  market and sell our products in those countries 
in our experience  obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years  and after it is 
table of contents obtained  it remains costly to maintain 
the fda and other us and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  require changes in labeling of our products  and mandate product withdrawals 
substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the united states and most are approved in europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses 
however  later discovery of unknown problems with our products could result in restrictions on the sale or use of such products  including potential withdrawal of the product from the market 
if new medical data suggests an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side affects  we may voluntarily withdraw  or regulatory authorities may mandate the withdrawal of such product from the market for some period or permanently 
we currently manufacture and market all our approved principal products  and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products 
see we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market 
even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products  these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
in addition  enbrel is manufactured both by us at our rhode island manufacturing facility and by third party contract manufacturers  boehringer ingelheim pharma kg bi pharma and genentech  inc genentech 
fill and finish of bulk product produced both at our rhode island manufacturing facility and at genentech is done by us and third party service providers 
bi pharma  genentech  and these third party service providers are also subject to fda regulatory authority 
see limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales 
in addition  later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third party service providers could result in restrictions on the sale  manufacture  or use of such products  including potential withdrawal of the products from the market 
if regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict  suspend  or revoke our prior approvals  they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third party service providers comply  or indefinitely 
in addition  if regulatory authorities determine that we or our licenser or partner conducting research and development activities on our behalf have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate  then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it 
if we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates  our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if our intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation  our business could be adversely affected 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal  scientific  and factual questions 
to date  there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies patents 
third parties may challenge  invalidate  or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products  product candidates  and technologies 
in addition  our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents 
for certain of our product candidates  there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories 
patent disputes are frequent  costly  and can preclude or delay commercialization of products 
we are currently  and in the future may be  involved in patent litigation 
for example  we are involved in an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against transkaryotic therapies  inc tkt and aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents 
if we lose or settle this or other litigations at certain stages or entirely  we could be subject to competition and or significant liabilities  required to enter into third party licenses for the infringed product or technology  or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates 
we have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin  natural and recombinant g csf  darbepoetin alfa  pegfilgrastim  etanercept  and our other products and potential products 
we market our erythropoietin  recombinant g csf  darbepoetin alfa  
table of contents pegfilgrastim  and etanercept products as epogen  neupogen  aranesp  neulasta  and enbrel  respectively 
for additional information on our material patents see patents and trademarks in item business 
we also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in europe relating to erythropoietin  g csf  pegfilgrastim pegylated g csf  etanercept  two relating to darbepoetin alfa  and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins 
our european patent relating to erythropoietin expired on december  and our european patent relating to g csf expires on august  we believe that after the expiration of each of these patents  other companies could receive approval for and market follow on or biosimilar products to each of these products in europe  presenting additional competition to our products 
see our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover  develop  acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do 
while we do not market erythropoietin in europe as this right belongs to johnson johnson through ka  we do market aranesp in the eu  which competes with johnson johnson s and others erythropoietin products 
we believe that the eu is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements related to the development and approval of new competitive products 
until such requirements are finalized  we cannot predict when follow on or biosimilar products could appear on the market in the eu or to what extent such additional competition would impact future aranesp and neupogen neulasta sales in the eu 
however  based on the process and timing outlined by the emea  we believe product specific guidelines are not likely to be finalized until limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales 
us and canadian supply of enbrel is impacted by many manufacturing variables  such as the timing and actual number of production runs  production success rate  bulk drug yield  and the timing and outcome of product quality testing 
for example  in the second quarter of  the prior co marketer with respect to enbrel  experienced a brief period where no enbrel was available to fill patient prescriptions  primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from bi pharma 
if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of enbrel to patients  we may lose patients  physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of enbrel  and enbrel sales will be adversely affected  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
see we are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of enbrel  and our sources of supply are limited 
we are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of enbrel  and our sources of supply are limited 
we currently produce a substantial portion of annual enbrel supply at our rhode island manufacturing facility 
however  we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our enbrel supply as well as for the fill and finish of enbrel that we manufacture 
bi pharma is our primary third party manufacturer of enbrel bulk drug  accordingly  our us and canadian supply of enbrel is currently significantly dependent on bi pharma s production schedule for enbrel 
we would be unable to produce enbrel in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in bi pharma s scheduled production if bi pharma or other third party manufacturers used for the fill and finish of enbrel bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials  products  or services to us for any reason  including due to labor shortages or disputes  due to regulatory requirements or action  or due to contamination of product lots or product recalls 
this in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for enbrel  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
factors that will affect our actual supply of enbrel at any time include  without limitation  the following bi pharma does not produce enbrel continuously  rather  it produces the bulk drug substance through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year 
our rhode island manufacturing facility is currently dedicated to enbrel production 
the amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors  including the timing and actual number of bi pharma s production runs  the actual number of runs at our rhode island manufacturing facility  and  for either the rhode island or bi pharma facilities  the level of production yields and success rates  the timing and outcome of product quality testing  and the amount of filling and packaging capacity 

table of contents bi pharma schedules the vialing production runs for enbrel in advance  based on the expected timing and yield of bulk drug production runs 
therefore  if bi pharma realizes production yields beyond expected levels  or provides additional manufacturing capacity for enbrel  it may not have sufficient vialing capacity for all of the enbrel bulk drug that it produces 
as a result  even if we are able to increase our supply of enbrel bulk drug  bi pharma may not be able to fill and finish the extra bulk drug in time to prevent any supply interruptions 
we are dependent on third parties for some fill and finish and packaging of enbrel bulk drug substance manufactured at our rhode island facility 
if third party fill and finish and packaging manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or otherwise unable to provide services to us  then supply of enbrel could be adversely affected 
our current plan to increase us and canadian supply of enbrel includes completion of an additional large scale cell culture commercial manufacturing facility adjacent to the current rhode island manufacturing facility 
we expect to submit this facility for fda approval in additionally  we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with genentech to produce enbrel at genentech s manufacturing facility in south san francisco  california and the fda approved this facility for enbrel production in october under the terms of the agreement  genentech is expected to produce enbrel through  with an extension through by mutual agreement 
enbrel bulk drug substance produced at the genentech facility will be produced in campaigns similar to those conducted at bi pharma 
consequently  supply from the genentech facility is expected to also be dependent on the timing and number of production runs in addition to the other manufacturing  filling  and packaging risk discussed above 
in addition  wyeth is constructing a new manufacturing facility in ireland  which is expected to increase the us and canadian supply of enbrel 
if the additional enbrel manufacturing capacity at the rhode island site  or in ireland are not completed on time  or if these manufacturing facilities do not receive fda or the european agency for the evaluation of medical products emea approval before we encounter supply constraints  our enbrel sales would be restricted  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales 
if these third party manufacturing facilities are completed and approved by the various regulatory authorities  our costs of acquiring bulk drug may fluctuate 
we formulate  fill and finish substantially all our products at our puerto rico manufacturing facility  if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility  we may not be able to supply these products 
we currently perform all of the formulation  fill and finish for epogen  aranesp  neupogen and neulasta and some formulation  fill and finish operations for enbrel at our manufacturing facility in juncos  puerto rico 
our global supply of these products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of this facility 
power failures  the breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters  including hurricanes  or failures to comply with regulatory requirements  including those of the fda  among others  could adversely affect our formulation  fill and finish operations 
as a result  we may be unable to supply these products  which could adversely and materially affect our product sales 
although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against business interruption loss  there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and could result in such losses materially and adversely affecting our operating results 
our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover  develop  acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated 
for example  enbrel competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by biogen idec inc  centocor  inc  johnson johnson  abbott  genentech  pfizer  novartis  and sanofi aventis  as well as the generic drug methotrexate  and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed 
additionally  aranesp competes with johnson johnson in the united states and the eu 
further  if our currently marketed products are 
table of contents approved for new uses  or if we sell new products  we may face new  additional competition that we do not face today 
additionally  some of our competitors  including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products 
in the future  we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development  drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products  and off label use of drugs approved for other indications 
our european patent relating to erythropoietin expired on december  and our european patent relating to g csf expires on august  we believe that after the expiration of each of these patents  other companies could receive approval for and market follow on or biosimilar products to each of these products in europe  presenting additional competition to our products 
while we do not market erythropoietin in europe as this right belongs to johnson johnson through ka  we do market aranesp in the eu  which competes with johnson johnson s and others erythropoietin products 
we believe that the eu is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements related to the development and approval of follow on or biosimilar products 
until such requirements are finalized  we cannot predict when follow on or biosimilar products could appear on the market in the eu or to what extent such additional competition would impact future aranesp and neupogen neulasta sales in the eu 
however  based on the process and timing outlined by the emea  we believe product specific guidelines are not likely to be finalized until our products may compete against products that have lower prices  superior performance  are easier to administer  or that are otherwise competitive with our products 
our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales 
large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical  research  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing  financial experience and human resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes 
these resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover  develop  and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market 
business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors 
certain of our raw materials  medical devices and components are single sourced from third parties  third party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products 
certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
also  certain medical devices and components necessary for fill  finish  and packaging of our products are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
certain of these raw materials  medical devices  and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third party suppliers and  in some cases  such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the fda so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the fda approved that other supplier 
we would be unable to obtain these raw materials  medical devices  or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third party single source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason  including due to regulatory requirements or action  due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier  or due to labor shortages or disputes 
this  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
also  certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources  including mammalian tissues  bovine serum and human serum albumin  or hsa 
we are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources 
raw materials may be subject to contamination and or recall 
also  some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs 
a material shortage  contamination  recall  and or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market 
this too  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents our product development efforts may not result in commercial products 
we intend to continue an aggressive research and development program 
successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain  and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product 
product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in early human clinical trials  may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the fda  did not approve our product candidate for an intended use the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate  such as patent rights  and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms  or at all the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics certain of our licensors or partners may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process  including  but not limited to  brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf  megakaryocyte growth and development factor mgdf  and glial cell lined derived neurotrophic factor gdnf 
for example  in  we announced the failure of bdnf for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  or lou gehrig s disease  because the product candidate  when administered by injection  did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase trial  even though bdnf had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials 
in addition  in  we discontinued development of mgdf  a novel platelet growth factor  at the phase trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies 
also  in june  we announced that the phase study of gdnf for the treatment of advanced parkinson s disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of six months of the double blind treatment phase of the study even though a small phase pilot investigator initiated open label study over a three year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced parkinson s disease patients 
subsequently  in the fall of we discontinued clinical development of gdnf in patients with advanced parkinson s disease after several patients in the phase study developed neutralizing antibodies and new preclinical data showed that gdnf caused irreversible damage to the area of the brain critical to movement control and coordination 
on february   we confirmed our previous decision to halt clinical trials and  as a part of that decision and based on thorough scientific review  we also concluded that we will not provide gdnf to the patients who participated in clinical trials that were terminated in the fall of of course  there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product 
we cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products 
further  clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians  and others  which may delay  limit  or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate 
also  the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product 
we expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval 
see our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval 

table of contents we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products  and changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations 
after any of our products are approved for commercial use  we or regulatory bodies could decide that changes to our product labeling are required 
label changes may be necessary for a number of reasons  including the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns by regulatory agencies or the discovery of significant problems with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products 
any significant concerns raised about the safety or efficacy of our products could also result in the need to reformulate those products  to conduct additional clinical trials  to make changes to our manufacturing processes  or to seek re approval of our manufacturing facilities 
significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of a product could ultimately lead to the revocation of its marketing approval 
the revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised 
the revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations 
see our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval 
our business may be impacted by government investigations or litigation 
we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters  government investigations  and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in item legal proceedings in our form k for the year ended december  and are updated as required in subsequently filed form qs 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and excessive verdicts can occur 
consequently  it is possible that we could  in the future  incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred 
the federal government  state governments and private payers are investigating  and many have filed actions against  numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including amgen and immunex  alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated average wholesale price awp  which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by medicare beneficiaries  insurers  state medicaid programs  medical plans and other payers to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products 
as of the date of this filing  a number of these actions have been brought against us and or immunex  now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
additionally  a number of states have pending investigations regarding our medicaid drug pricing practices and the us departments of justice and health and human services have requested that immunex produce documents relating to pricing issues 
further  certain state government entity plaintiffs in some of these awp cases are also alleging that companies  including ours  are not reporting their best price to the states under the medicaid program 
these cases and investigations are described in item legal proceedings average wholesale price litigation in our form k for the year ended december   and are updated as required in subsequent form qs 
other states and agencies could initiate investigations of our pricing practices 
a decision adverse to our interests on these actions and or investigations could result in substantial economic damages and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred 
we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims 
product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products 
we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval 
product liability claims  regardless of their merits  could be costly and divert manage 
table of contents ment s attention  and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products 
amgen and immunex have been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain company products 
our operating results may fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons 
in budgeting our operating expenses for the foreseeable future  we assume that revenues will continue to grow  however  some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term 
because of this  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be below our expectations or projections 
a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
for example  we may face changes in the government s or private payers reimbursement policies for our products inability to maintain regulatory approval of marketed products changes in our product pricing strategies lower than expected demand for our products inability to provide adequate supply of our products changes in wholesaler buying patterns increased competition from new or existing products fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of course  there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period 
similarly if investors or the investment community are uncertain about our financial performance for a given period  our stock price could also be adversely impacted 
we have grown rapidly  and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted 
we have had an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and facilities 
we plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks  some of which we cannot control 
for example we need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control we will need to assimilate new staff members we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing organization we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control we will need to start up and operate a number of new manufacturing facilities  which may result in temporary inefficiencies and higher cost of goods of course  there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks 
our stock price is volatile  which could adversely affect your investment 
our stock price  like that of other biotechnology companies  is highly volatile 
for example  in the fifty two weeks prior to december   the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
our stock price may be affected by a number of factors  such as changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products 
table of contents clinical trial results actual or anticipated product supply constraints product development announcements by us or our competitors regulatory matters announcements in the scientific and research community intellectual property and legal matters broader economic  industry and market trends unrelated to our performance in addition  if our revenues  earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations 
the development  manufacturing  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
see our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval 
and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices  we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations and or laws 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations and or laws a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  including withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government healthcare programs  or other sanctions or litigation 
our marketing of enbrel will be dependent in part upon wyeth 
under a co promotion agreement  we and wyeth market and sell enbrel in the united states and canada 
a management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of enbrel including strategic planning  the approval of an annual marketing plan  product pricing  and the establishment of a brand team 
the brand team  with equal representation from us and wyeth  will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan  which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party  and is responsible for all sales activities 
if wyeth fails to market enbrel effectively or if we and wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively  our sales of enbrel may be adversely affected 
guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products 
government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products 
however  professional societies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  dosage  route of administration  and use of related therapies 
organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products 
recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products 
in addition  the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 

table of contents continual manufacturing process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired 
in connection with our ongoing process improvement activities associated with products we manufacture  we continually invest in our various manufacturing practices and related processes with the objective of increasing production yields and success rates to gain increased cost efficiencies and capacity utilization 
depending on the timing and outcomes of these efforts and our other estimates and assumptions regarding future product sales  the carrying value of certain manufacturing facilities or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value at the time that such effects are identified 
the potential recognition of impairment in the carrying value  if any  could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with tularik 
on august   we merged with tularik inc the success of our merger with tularik will depend  in part  on our ability to retain tularik staff and to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings  and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of tularik with the businesses of amgen 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations and personnel of tularik 
the integration of two independent companies is a complex  costly  and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others retaining key staff members consolidating research and development operations consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures preserving ours and tularik s research and development  and other important relationships minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns coordinating geographically separate organizations in addition  even if we are able to integrate tularik s operations successfully  this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the synergies  cost savings  or sales and growth opportunities that we expect or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
for example  as of the date of this filing  we have discontinued a number of tularik clinical development programs and may discontinue other or all such programs 
further  the elimination of significant duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies 
we cannot assure you that the integration of tularik with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger 
our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income earned on our fixed income investment portfolio is impacted by fluctuations in us interest rates upon reinvestment of funds received on maturity or sale of securities at the then current market rates 
in  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  which also qualify and are designated as fair value hedges  to protect against possible increases in value of the notes and notes 
in  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  which also qualify and are designated as fair value hedges  to protect against possible increase in value of the notes and the century notes 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our notes  notes  notes  century notes and convertible notes because they bear interest at fixed rates 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our investment portfolio and debt obligations  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed our available for sale debt securities  comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities  are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
for the interest rate swaps  the tables present the notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity date

on march   as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their march  put option  we repurchased  million  or approximately  of the outstanding convertible notes at their then accreted value for cash 
concurrently  we amended the terms of the convertible notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders  at their option  to cause us to repurchase the convertible notes on march  at the then accreted 
table of contents value 
the amounts above reflect the convertible notes accreted value repurchased on march  and the remaining convertible notes accreted value on march   the next put date 
in the event we are required to repurchase the remaining convertible notes  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and or shares of common stock  which would be issued at the then current market price 
see note  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
at december  and  we had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of our equity investment portfolio 
we did not have material equity price risk on the unhedged portion of our equity investment portfolio at december  and our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro  as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates have been mitigated by the natural  opposite impact to our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our results of operations 
as such  the impact to our results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated
