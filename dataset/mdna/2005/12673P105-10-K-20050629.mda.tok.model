as described in note  acquisitions  divestitures  and restructuring of the consolidated financial statements  in fiscal year we divested a subsidiary  accpac international  inc accpac 
the assets  liabilities  results of operations  and cash flow of accpac have been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented prior to the sale of accpac in march the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations excludes the effect of the discontinued operation 
additionally  the information below reflects the effects of the restatements announced in as more fully described in part i  item of this form k and the subsequent restatements announced in may more fully described in the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item of this form k 
business overview we are one of the world s largest providers of management software 
our software enables our customers to manage their complex it infrastructures across systems and networks  security  and storage solutions 
our platform neutral  integrated technologies help customers manage the investments they have made in it and make it possible for them to manage all of the computers  networks  and other technologies that comprise their computing environment 
our products enable customers to better manage and reduce it costs and risks 
our products participate in a number of high growth areas  including systems and security management  and business services optimization which helps organizations align it to business processes 
our products include both mainframe and distributed solutions  each of which comprise about half of our revenue 
we are focused on four key strategies to drive growth internal product development in fiscal year  we invested approximately percent of our revenue in research and development to deliver innovative and relevant technology 
in particular  we are focused on market leadership in the core areas of systems management and security management 
in april  we reorganized our product development group into five business units to enable us to be more accountable to business and customer needs and to be more responsive to the changing dynamics of the management software marketplace 
international expansion we are increasing our investments in emerging markets  such as china  india  and other countries  to expand our reach and to grow sales 
partnerships and relationships with systems integrators and channel participants are of particular importance in these regions 
in addition to our focus on enterprise customers  we are pursuing the small and medium sized customer market  particularly in the europe  middle east  and africa emea region 
alternative routes to market we have a direct sales force of over  quota carrying salespeople who generate most of our revenue 
however  not all customers buy technology directly from the software vendor  providing additional growth opportunities in the area of indirect sales 
developing further channel partnerships is a top priority for us 
to help accelerate the growth of our channel business  we recently launched a new enterprise solution provider program that makes it easier for customers to buy products and to eliminate potential conflicts between direct and indirect sales channels 
we have moved to a named account structure  where our direct sales organization will focus on developing relationships with the largest and most important customers 
other accounts will primarily be serviced by reseller partners 
we will also partner with oems and global systems integrators that play an important role in determining technology purchases in large enterprises 
channel partnerships will also allow us to more cost effectively pursue the small and medium size customer market and will provide us a larger technical pool from which we can draw resources to provide professional services to our customers 
strategic acquisitions while internal product development is critical to our long term success  targeted acquisitions of technologies are equally important 
we will continue to make small to medium sized acquisitions in our core areas of systems and security management for the enterprise  similar to our recent acquisitions of pest patrol  netegrity  concord and our anticipated acquisition of niku 
significant business events the government investigation in fiscal year  the usao and the sec commenced an investigation concerning certain of our past accounting practices  including our revenue recognition procedures in periods prior to the adoption of the business model in october in september  we reached agreements with the usao and the sec by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the usao and by consenting to the sec s filing of a final consent judgment in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york the federal court

acquisitions and divestures in june  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire niku a leading provider of information technology management and governance solutions  in an all cash transaction valued at approximately million  or approximately million net of cash acquired 
niku s primary software product  clarity it mg  is an integrated suite that spans the full it life cycle  from investment selection  to execution and delivery of initiatives  to results assessment 
in january  we had announced we had signed a partnership to resell  service  and support niku s clarity software 
we anticipate integrating clarity it mg with our business service optimization bso unit 
the acquisition is subject to approval by both regulatory authorities and niku s shareholders and is expected to be completed by august in june  we acquired the common stock of concord  a leading provider of network service management software solutions  in an all cash transaction valued at approximately million 
we also assumed approximately million in net debt from concord for a total purchase price of approximately million  excluding acquisition costs 
concord was a provider of infrastructure software principally in the areas of network health  performance  and fault management 
we plan to make concord s ehealth and spectrum software available both as independent products and as integrated components of our unicenter product portfolio 
in november  we completed the acquisition of netegrity  a leading provider of security software solutions in the area of access and identity management  in a transaction valued at approximately million in the aggregate 
netegrity was a provider of business security software  principally in the areas of identity and access management  and we have made netegrity s identity and access management solutions available both as independent products and as integrated components of our etrust identity and access management suite 
in august  we acquired pest patrol  a privately held provider of anti spyware and security solutions  in an all cash transaction of approximately million 
the products acquired in this transaction were integrated into the company s etrust threat management software product portfolio 
this portfolio protects organizations from diverse internet dangers such as viruses  spam  and inappropriate use of the web by employees 
in march  we sold our approximate interest in accpac 
our net proceeds totaled million for all of our outstanding equity interests of accpac  including options and change of control payments for certain accpac officers and managers 
we received approximately million of the net proceeds in fiscal year and the remainder in fiscal year accpac specializes in accounting  customer relationship management  human resources  warehouse management  manufacturing  electronic data interchange  and point of sale software for small and medium sized businesses 
as a result of the sale  we realized a gain  net of taxes  of approximately million in fiscal year in the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an adjustment to the gain of million  net of tax  that reduced the net gain to million 
approximately of our employees were transferred to sage in fiscal year the sale completed our multi year effort to exit the business applications market 
restructuring and reorganization in the second quarter of fiscal year  we announced a restructuring plan that was designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities 
the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately five percent or positions worldwide  slightly lower than our original estimate of positions 
the plan is expected to yield about million in savings on an annualized basis 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal year for severance and other termination benefits  and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to the restructuring plan 
as of march   we have made substantially all payments under the plan 
in april and in connection with the reorganization of the us channel sales organization and the combination of the pre and post sales technical organizations  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide during the quarter ended june  the combination of our pre and post sales organizations resulted in the creation of what we refer to as our ca technology services organization 
the reorganization of our us channel sales organization included the creation of a person customer interaction call center located in tampa  florida 
each of these actions enabled us to achieve efficiencies associated with certain redundant functions that resulted in the elimination of certain positions 
we also expensed approximately million of severance and other termination benefits in the first quarter of fiscal year related to the headcount reduction 
we estimate that we achieved annual cost savings of approximately million associated with the headcount reductions 
business model as described in greater detail in item  business  we license our software products directly to customers as well as through distributors  resellers  and vars 
we generate revenue from the following sources license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis  maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements  and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation  consulting  and education services 
the timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period are determined individually by license agreement  based on its duration and specific terms 
under our business model  we provide customers with the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements 
we also permit customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change  which includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee 
as a result of the right our customers have to receive unspecified future upgrades  we are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap to recognize revenue from our license agreements evenly on a monthly basis also known as ratably over the license term 
we believe recognizing license revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement more accurately reflects the earnings process  we also believe that it improves the predictability of our reported revenue streams 
under agreements entered into prior to october the prior business model  and as is common practice in the software industry  we did not offer our customers the right to receive unspecified future upgrades 
as a result  for most license agreements entered into prior to october  we were required under gaap to record the present value of the license agreement as revenue at the time the license agreement was signed 
under our business model  the portion of the license revenue that has not yet been recognized creates what we refer to as deferred subscription revenue 
deferred subscription revenue is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the license agreements 
when recognized  this revenue is reported on the subscription revenue line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
if a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue  the amount deferred is reported as a liability entitled deferred subscription revenue collected on our consolidated balance sheets 
not all of our active customer contracts have been transitioned to our business model  which has created what we refer to as a transition period  during which the license agreements under our prior business model come up for renewal 
during this transition period  we are building deferred subscription revenue  from which subscription revenue will be amortized 
total deferred subscription revenue  and the associated subscription revenue that comes out of it  is expected to increase over time as we continue to renew customer contracts that were executed under the prior business model  sell additional products and capacity to existing customers  as well as enter into new contracts with new customers 
we expect that the majority of contracts executed under the prior business model will be transitioned to our business model by the end of fiscal year while the impact of changing from an up front revenue recognition model to our business model initially postponed recognition of amounts that previously would have been recognized earlier under the up front model  we generally did not change our cost structure 
therefore  we have primarily experienced losses since we introduced our business model 
we expect that our revenues will continue to increase at a greater rate than our expenses 
under both the prior business model and current business model  customers often pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement 
we refer to these payments as installment payments 
while the transition to the current business model has changed the timing of revenue recognition  in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers 
as a result  our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current business model over the past several years 
we do not expect any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as a result of this transition 
performance indicators management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition 
each provides a measurement of the performance of our business model and how well we are executing our plan 
our subscription based business model is unique among our competitors in the software industry and particularly during the transition period it is difficult to compare our results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors 
the following is a summary of the principal quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review performance percent for the year ended march  change change dollars in millions restated subscription revenue total revenue subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue new deferred subscription revenue direct new deferred subscription revenue indirect n a n a n a weighted average license agreement duration in years direct cash from continuing operating activities income loss from continuing operations n a percent as of march  change change dollars in millions total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities total debt analyses of our performance indicators  including general trends  can be found in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this md a 
the performance indicators discussed below are those that we believe are unique because of our subscription based business model 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription revenue 
if the weighted average life of our license agreements remains constant  an increase in deferred subscription revenue will result in an increase in subscription revenue 
since we expect an increase in deferred subscription revenue in fiscal year  we also expect subscription revenue to continue to increase for that period 
new deferred subscription revenue new deferred subscription revenue represents the total undiscounted incremental value contract value of subscription software licenses sold in a period 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we began offering more flexible license terms to our channel partners  necessitating ratable recognition of revenue for the majority of our indirect business 
prior to july   such channel license revenue had been recorded on a sell through basis when a distributor  reseller  or var sells the software product to their customers and reported on the software fees and other line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
new deferred subscription revenue excludes the value associated with maintenance only license agreements  license only indirect sales  and professional services arrangements 
new deferred subscription revenue is what we expect to collect over time from our customers based upon contractual license agreements 
this amount is recognized as subscription revenue ratably over the applicable software license term 
the license agreements that contribute to new deferred subscription revenue represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods generally up to three years 
new deferred subscription revenue is sometimes referred to as bookings and is used by management as a gauge of the level of business activity in a particular quarter 
our bookings typically increase in each consecutive fiscal quarter  with the fourth quarter being the strongest 
however  since the level of bookings can be impacted by the volume and dollar amount of contracts coming up for renewal  an increase in bookings does not necessarily equate to an increase in billings or cash receipts 
the contribution to current period revenue from new deferred subscription revenue from any single license agreement is relatively small  since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable license agreement term 
this diminishes the importance of having to complete transactions prior to the end of a particular quarter and allows us to enter into agreements with terms that are more favorable to the company 
weighted average license agreement duration in years the weighted average license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all software licenses executed during a period  weighted to reflect the contract value of each individual software license 
the annual weighted average duration of and years for the fiscal years and  respectively  were derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts and quarterly weighted average durations in years fiscal year fiscal year weighted weighted new deferred average new deferred average subscription duration subscription duration revenue in years revenue in years dollars in millions fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter we believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years increase the value customers receive from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change 
we also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by us to each of our customers 
the increase in new deferred subscription revenue and the weighted average duration in years for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was primarily attributable to the extension of license agreements with two large customers 
one agreement has an incremental value of approximately million and has a duration of four years and one agreement has an incremental value at approximately million and has a duration of five years 
excluding these two agreements  the weighted average duration of our license agreements for the fourth quarter of fiscal year would have been years 
results of operations revenue the following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the revenue line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march    and these comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
fiscal year fiscal year percentage percentage percentage of of percentage of of total dollar total dollar revenue change revenue change restated restated restated revenue subscription revenue maintenance software fees and other financing fees professional services total revenue total revenue total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from the fiscal year ended march   to billion 
this increase was partially a result of the transition to our business model  which contributed additional subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in total revenue was also partially attributable to the sales of netegrity products which contributed approximately million of revenue in the second half of fiscal year in addition  as our international contracts are denominated in local currencies  the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound as well as certain other currencies against the us dollar increased our revenue by approximately million 
total revenue in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was negatively impacted by anticipated decreases in maintenance and financing fees resulting from how these items are accounted for under the business model 
the recognition of maintenance and financing fees under our business model is discussed further under subscription revenue in this md a 
our revenues were further negatively impacted by the fact that beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  revenue from certain contracts in our channel business is recorded as new deferred subscription revenue  which will be ratably recognized into subscription revenue in future periods compared to prior periods when the majority of such revenue was recognized up front 
total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from the fiscal year ended march   to billion 
this increase in total revenue was primarily due to the transition to our business model that began during the third quarter of fiscal year this transition resulted in an increase in subscription revenue from fiscal year  partially offset by an anticipated decrease in maintenance and financing fees as described below 
professional services and software fees and other revenue collectively decreased by million for fiscal year as described below 
in addition  in fiscal year  there was a positive impact to revenue of million compared to fiscal year due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
continued cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year subscription revenue subscription revenue represents the portion of revenue ratably recognized on software license agreements entered into under our business model 
many of the licenses recorded between october  when our business model was implemented  and the end of fiscal year continued to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly  ratable basis 
as a result  subscription revenue for fiscal year includes the ratable recognition of bookings recorded in fiscal year  as well as bookings recorded between october and the end of fiscal year this is the primary reason for the increase in subscription revenue in fiscal year versus fiscal year subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from fiscal year  to billion 
for the years ended march  and  we added new deferred subscription revenue related to our direct business of billion and billion  respectively 
licenses executed under our business model in the years ended march  and had weighted average durations of and years  respectively 
annualized deferred subscription revenue represents the total value of all new software license agreements entered into during a period divided by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period 
annualized deferred subscription revenue related to our direct business increased approximately million  or  for the fiscal year ended march  over the comparable prior fiscal year to billion 
in addition  we recorded million of new deferred subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended march  related to our indirect business 
subscription revenue was further increased as a result of how we record maintenance revenue under our business model as described below 
approximately of the deferred subscription revenue balance at march  is associated with multi year contracts signed with the us federal government and are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval 
under the prior business model  maintenance revenue was separately identified and was reported on the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
under the business model  maintenance that is bundled with product sales is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
under the prior business model  financing revenue was also separately identified on the consolidated statements of operations 
under the business model  financing fees are no longer applicable and the entire contract value is now recognized as subscription revenue over the term of the contract 
the quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not determinable 
subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from fiscal year to billion 
similar to the increase in fiscal year  the increase was primarily due to our transition to our business model 
fiscal year included subscription revenue earned from prior business model software license agreements that renewed during fiscal year these license agreements did not contribute to revenue in fiscal year during fiscal years and  we added new deferred subscription revenue of billion and billion  respectively 
maintenance as expected  maintenance revenue for fiscal years and continued to decline  reflecting a decrease of million and million  respectively  from the prior fiscal years to million and million  respectively 
the decrease in maintenance revenue for both years reflects the transition to and increased number of license agreements executed under our business model  where maintenance revenue  bundled along with license revenue  is reported on the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized on a monthly basis ratably over the term of the agreement 
the decrease was partially offset by new maintenance revenue earned from customers who elected optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements 
the quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in maintenance revenue is not determinable since maintenance bundled with software licenses under our business model is not separately identified 
for the fiscal year ended march   maintenance revenue from our indirect business increased million from the fiscal year ended march   to million 
software fees and other software fees and other revenue consist of revenue related to distribution and oem partners that have been recorded on a sell through basis  revenue associated with joint ventures  royalty revenues  and other revenue 
revenue related to distribution partners and oems is sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue 
for the fiscal year ended march   software fees and other revenue decreased million from the fiscal year ended march   to million 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we began offering more flexible license terms to our channel partners  which necessitates the deferral of revenue for the majority of our channel business 
the ratable recognition of this deferred revenue is reflected on the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the company experienced approximately a increase in the dollar amount of indirect license contract bookings in the fiscal year ended march  versus the comparable prior fiscal year 
indirect license contract bookings represent the total undiscounted incremental value of all licenses sold as part of our channel business 
the increase in bookings resulted in million of new deferred subscription revenue related to the channel business that will be deferred and recognized ratably as subscription revenue over the term of the applicable software licenses 
in addition  for the fiscal year ended march  and  million and million  respectively  of indirect maintenance revenue was deferred 
these amounts are amortized into revenue over the term of the arrangement on the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in software fees and other revenue was partially offset by approximately million of license revenue associated with the sale of netegrity products and an approximate million benefit associated with the resolution of a prior business model contract dispute in the second quarter of fiscal year for the fiscal year ended march   software fees and other decreased million from the fiscal year ended march   to million 
the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the amount of channel sales recognized as deferred maintenance of approximately million over the fiscal year ended march  this deferred maintenance will be amortized into revenue over time on the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in software fees and other was partially offset by an increase in the amount of indirect license revenue recorded in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year financing fees financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the prior business model  which required up front revenue recognition 
this discount initially reduced the related installment accounts receivable and was referred to as unamortized discounts 
the related unamortized discount is amortized over the life of the applicable license agreement and is reported as financing fees 
under our business model  additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded  since we no longer recognize revenue on an up front basis for sales of products with extended payment terms 
as expected  for fiscal years and  financing fees continued to decline  reflecting a decrease of million and million  respectively  from the prior fiscal years to million and million  respectively 
the decrease in financing fee revenue for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under the prior business model and is expected to decline to zero over the next several years 
professional services professional services revenue for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to growth in security software engagements  which utilize access control and identity management solutions as well as growth in it service and asset management solutions 
the increase was also partially attributable to approximately million of services revenue associated with the sale of netegrity products 
this increase in services revenue was limited due to an increase in services sold in combination with related software products of approximately million  which requires that such services revenue be recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period 
professional services revenue for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was a result of the weak spending environment that affected the it service sector in general  our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products  as well as services sold in combination with related software products of approximately million  which requires that such services revenue be recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period 
our professional services headcount was reduced by approximately as a result of the creation of our ca technology services group in april quantification of the impact that these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not determinable 
total revenue by geography the following table presents the amount of revenue earned from the united states and international geographic regions and corresponding percentage changes for the fiscal years ended march   and these comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
fiscal year fiscal year dollars in millions change change restated restated restated united states international international revenue increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately million for fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in foreign currency exchange is primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
the increase was also a result of an increase in contract bookings in prior periods associated with our european business 
the increase in revenue from the united states was primarily attributable to an increase in contract booking in prior periods as well as an increase in professional services revenue 
the increase was partially offset by decreases in revenue from maintenance  finance fees  and software fees and other revenue 
international revenue increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately million for fiscal year over fiscal year  which was primarily caused by the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
the increase was also a result of an increase in contract bookings in prior periods associated with our european business 
despite an increase in fiscal year of combined subscription  maintenance  and financing revenue in the united states of approximately million  compared with fiscal year  total revenue in the united states declined slightly primarily due to a decrease in professional services revenue and software fees and other 
price changes and inflation did not have a material impact in fiscal years   or expenses the following table presents expenses as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march    and these comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
fiscal year fiscal year percentage percentage percentage of of percentage of of total dollar total dollar revenue change revenue change restated restated restated operating expenses amortization of capitalized software costs cost of professional services selling  general  and administrative product development and enhancements commission and royalties depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets goodwill impairment other gains expenses  net n a restructuring charge n a shareholder litigation and government investigation settlements n a total operating expenses interest expense  net note amounts may not add to their respective totals due to rounding 
amortization of capitalized software costs amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and capitalized internally generated software development costs 
internally generated capitalized software costs are related to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage 
amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal years and decreased million and million  respectively  from the prior fiscal years to and million  respectively 
the total decrease for both years was due primarily to certain purchased software assets becoming fully amortized 
we recorded amortization of purchased software products for the fiscal years ended march    and of million  million  and million  respectively 
we recorded amortization of capitalized internally generated software development costs for the fiscal years ended march    and of million  million  and million  respectively 
cost of professional services cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers 
cost of professional services for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year to million 
this increase was partially offset by approximately million of professional services costs related to services sold in combination with related software products  which requires that the total estimated cost of such services be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period 
effective april   we began charging to expense the computed value of all newly granted stock based compensation over the vesting period 
cost of professional services for the fiscal year ended march  and included approximately million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense associated with the company s adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
refer to note  significant accounting policies accounting for stock based compensation for additional information 
the improvement in professional services gross margin is attributable to a more effective utilization of professional staff associated with slightly reduced headcount and increased professional services revenue 
cost of professional services for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
this decrease was due primarily to the reduction in professional services engagements  a reduction in personnel costs resulting from efficiencies associated with the combination of our pre sales and post sales professional services organizations in fiscal year  and a reduction of million due to an increase in services sold in combination with related software products  which requires that the total estimated cost of such services be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period 
selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a expenses for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year to billion 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs  including an increase of approximately million in stock based compensation expense principally related to our adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
in addition  in fiscal year we recorded a credit of approximately million for the provision of doubtful accounts  which is lower than the credit of million we recorded in fiscal year the credit in the provision for doubtful accounts is a result of the reduction in the prior business model accounts receivable 
under the business model  amounts due from customers are offset by related deferred subscription revenue  resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet 
in addition  under the business model  customer payments are often received in advance of revenue recognition  which results in a reduced net credit exposure 
each of these items reduces the need to provide for estimated bad debts 
sg a for the years ended march  and also included approximately million and million  respectively  of legal expenses related to the government investigation and  for the year ended march   included million for consulting and other fees associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance program 
further  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we realized a gain of approximately million on the sale of an investment that was included in sg a 
sg a expenses for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to billion 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the provision of doubtful accounts of million 
as noted above  this decrease is a result of how we account for contractual commitments under the business model 
the decrease in sg a was partially offset by a million expense for severance and other termination benefits in connection with the reorganization of the us channel sales organization and the creation of ca technology services in april  as well as other increases in personnel and related costs 
in addition  we incurred legal and other professional service expenses associated with the investigations conducted by the audit committee  the sec  and the us attorney s office of approximately million  which represents an increase of approximately million from fiscal year the total stock based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year was approximately million 
product development and enhancements for fiscal year  product development and enhancement expenditures  also referred to as research and development  increased million compared to fiscal year to million 
product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately of total revenue for fiscal years ended march  and in addition  product development and enhancements for the years ended march  and included approximately million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense associated with the company s adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
during fiscal year  we continued to focus on and invest in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies such as wireless  web services and on demand computing  as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings 
product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year to million 
the increase was primarily a result of an increase in general operating expenditures  as we continue to invest in product development and enhancements such as emerging technologies and a general broadening of our enterprise product offerings 
product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately and of total revenue in each of the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
commissions and royalties commissions and royalties for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year to million 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription revenue recorded in fiscal year on which sales commissions are based  as compared with fiscal year commissions are expensed in the period that they are earned by employees  which is typically in the period we record the related deferred subscription revenue 
commissions and royalties for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year to million 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription revenue recorded in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the increase was partially offset by a million reduction in royalties to third parties  as we continue to focus on internal product development and enhancements 
depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million

outlook for fiscal year the outlook for our fiscal year is premised on the assumption that there will be limited to modest improvement in the current economic and it environments 
we also believe that customers will continue to be cautious with their technology purchases 
our preliminary outlook for fiscal year is to generate revenue in the range of billion to billion and earnings per share in the range of to 
we expect that subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue  as well as annualized deferred subscription revenue  should continue to increase during fiscal year for the same reasons as described in results of operations for the fiscal year increase  cash generated from operations should decline from to  as a result of an increase in taxes paid from fiscal year of approximately million  as well as a payment of approximately million as part of the dpa  our weighted average license agreement duration should continue to be approximately years  maintenance revenue as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations should continue to decrease as deferred maintenance revenue previously recorded under our prior business model is amortized over the term of the original license agreement  financing fees should continue to decrease as amounts earned from license agreements under our prior business model are amortized over the term of the original license agreement  the level of professional service engagements for fiscal year should increase slightly from fiscal year  total sg a expense for fiscal year should increase approximately due to acquisitions  our continuing effort to build distribution call centers  and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  we will incur approximately million pre tax in non cash stock based compensation charges in connection with our early adoption of sfas no 
r we incurred million of total stock based compensation charges in fiscal year  product development and enhancement expenditures should increase approximately due to recent acquisitions and should continue to constitute a significant portion of total operating expenses in fiscal year we should pay approximately million in income taxes we paid million in taxes in fiscal year  we should repurchase shares valued at up to million in each quarter of fiscal year  for an annual share repurchase value of up to million  we should pay a cash dividend of per share  payable in quarterly installments of per share as and when declared by the board of directors  and our debt level should decrease to approximately billion as a result of fiscal year scheduled payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
note  significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use 
many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment  either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change 
we consider the following significant accounting polices to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the following primary sources licensing software products  providing customer technical support referred to as maintenance  and providing professional services  such as consulting and education 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in accordance with sop  we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software products when all of the following criteria are met we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer  we deliver the products  license agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final  and collection is probable 
our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions 
an acceptance provision allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software 
if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision  we do not record deferred subscription revenue or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or  if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement  the expiration of the acceptance period 
under our business model  software license agreements include flexible contractual provisions that  among other things  allow customers to receive unspecified future software products for no additional fee 
these agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement 
under these agreements  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four sop recognition criteria noted above 
for license agreements signed prior to october the prior business model  once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met  software license fees were recognized as revenue up front  and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license 
maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under the prior business model  and stand alone maintenance agreements 
under the prior business model  maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement 
the maintenance portion was deferred and amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term 
many of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and  therefore  continue to amortize 
this amortization is recorded to the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the deferred maintenance portion  which was optional to the customer  was determined using its fair value based on annual  fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement 
for license agreements entered into under our current business model  maintenance and license fees continue to be combined  however  the maintenance is no longer optional on an annual basis but rather is inclusive for the entire term 
we report such combined fees on the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
we record stand alone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance for their non term based license agreements 
maintenance revenue from such renewals is recognized over the term of the renewal agreement 
the deferred maintenance revenue line item on our consolidated balance sheets principally represents payments received in advance of maintenance services rendered 
revenue from professional service arrangements is recognized pursuant to the provisions of sop  which in most cases is as the services are performed 
revenues from professional services that are sold as part of a software transaction are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction 
if it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed 
revenue from sales to distributors  resellers  and vars is recognized when all four of the sop revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers 
this is commonly referred to as the sell through method 
beginning july   a majority of sales of products to distributors  resellers and vars incorporate the right to receive certain unspecified future software products and revenue from those contracts is therefore recognized on a ratable basis 
we have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed upon receipt of cash payment 
our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products 
such warranties are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote 
under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements  we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on  among other things  allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
in most cases  in the event of an infringement claim  we retain the right to i procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product  ii replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality  or iii if neither i nor ii can be reasonably achieved  we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid 
such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote 
in most cases and where legally enforceable  the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer 
accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
in developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts  we rely on several factors  including historical information  such as general collection history of multi year software agreements  current customer information events  such as extended delinquency  requests for restructuring  and filing for bankruptcy  results of analyzing historical and current data  and the overall macroeconomic environment 
the allowance is comprised of two components a specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when  based on current information  we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer  and b an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based on the analysis of the specifically reviewed receivables 
we expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected 
under our business model  amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription revenue unearned revenue related to these amounts  resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet 
therefore  a smaller allowance for doubtful accounts is required 
income taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes known as temporary differences  which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets and net operating losses will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we have recognized as a deferred tax asset a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations 
as of march   our gross deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance  totaled million 
realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets result from acquisition expenses  such as duplicate facility costs  employee severance and other costs that are not deductible until paid  net operating losses nols and temporary differences between the taxable cash payments received from customers and the ratable recognition of revenue in accordance with gaap 
the nols expire between and an additional valuation allowance of million million from acquired nols was established in fiscal year for certain nols and other deferred tax assets we believe might not be realized 
future results may vary from these estimates 
at this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements 
goodwill  capitalized software products  and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
absent any prior indicators of impairment  we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
we performed our annual assessment for fiscal year and concluded that there were no impairments to record 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test  and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test  is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management 
this approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flow  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow  and a terminal growth rate 
the carrying value of capitalized software products  both purchased software and internally developed software  and other intangible assets  are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment 
the facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date 
it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or  if such an impairment were to occur  the magnitude thereof 
product development and enhancements we account for product development and enhancements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates 
if other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility  the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been impacted 
accounting for stock based compensation we currently maintain stock based compensation plans 
prior to april   we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and related interpretations 
effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
we selected the prospective method to transition to the fair value method of measuring stock based compensation expense 
under the prospective method  we recognize compensation expense related to all stock awards granted after march  we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives  and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of a loss and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
due to the uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims  and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements for a description of our material legal proceedings 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
this act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided that certain criteria are met 
in addition  on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
the company expects to repatriate approximately million of cash under the american jobs creation act of during fiscal year and has therefore accrued a million or per share tax charge in fiscal year we expect a benefit of approximately million or per share in the quarter ending june  reflecting the department of treasury and irs notice issued on may  which will substantially reduce the taxes associated with the repatriation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r will require companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
beginning in april  the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r under the modified retrospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  the company is required to restate prior period financial results to include the impact of share based compensation expense 
we expect we will incur approximately million pre tax in non cash stock based compensation charges in connection with our early adoption of sfas no 
r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the company s second quarter of fiscal year the company does not believe that adopting of sfas no 
will have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as that term is used in fasb no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
it also clarifies when an entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company is not required to begin applying the provisions of fin until fiscal year the company is in the process of assessing the impact of the pronouncement s requirements on its financial statements 
risk factors current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below 
any of these factors  or others  many of which are beyond our control  could negatively affect our revenue  profitability  and cash flow 
operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors 
quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors  including those listed below  which in turn could adversely affect our revenue  profitability  and cash flow in the future 
demand for products and services  length of sales cycle  customer implementation of our products  magnitude of price and product and or services competition  introduction of new hardware  general economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business  customer budgets for hardware  software and services  ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ability to control costs  the size of licensing transactions  reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces  the results of litigation  including the government and internal investigations  ability to retain and attract qualified personnel  and reaction of customers to our business model 
any of the foregoing factors  among others  may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high  or cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
as a consequence  our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow could be adversely affected 
the success of our international operations is subject to many factors 
international revenue has historically represented a significant percentage of our total worldwide revenue 
continued success in selling our products outside the united states will depend on a variety of factors  including reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces  fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates  staffing key managerial positions  the ability to successfully localize software products for a significant number of international markets  general economic conditions in foreign countries  political stability  trade restrictions such as tariffs  duties  or other controls affecting foreign operations  and any of the foregoing factors  among others  could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
we have entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the us attorney s office for the eastern district of new york usao  we may be subject to criminal prosecution if we violate this agreement 
additionally  we have entered into a final consent judgment with the sec and we may be subject to  among other things  substantial civil penalties and fines if we violate our agreement with the sec 
our agreements with the usao and the sec resolve their investigations into certain of our past accounting practices  including our revenue recognition policies and procedures  and obstruction of their investigations provided we comply with certain continuing requirements under these agreements 
we describe some of these requirements below 
for more information about our agreements with the usao and the sec  refer to note  commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements as well as our current report on form on k filed september  the dpa if it is determined that we deliberately gave false  incomplete or misleading information pursuant to the dpa  have committed any federal crimes subsequent to the dpa  or otherwise knowingly  intentionally  and materially violated any provision of the dpa  we shall be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the usao has knowledge 
any such prosecution may be based on information we have provided to the usao  the sec and other governmental agencies in connection with our cooperation under the dpa 
this would include information provided because of our entry into the dpa that otherwise may not have been available to the usao or may otherwise have been subject to privilege 
our continued cooperation with the usao  the sec  and our newly appointed independent examiner see below pursuant to the dpa and consent judgment may lead to the discovery of additional information regarding the conduct of the company  including members of former management in prior periods 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  of any such information on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
the final consent judgment with the sec the consent judgment pursuant to the consent judgment  we are enjoined from violating a number of provisions of the federal securities laws 
any further violation of these laws could result in civil remedies  including sanctions  fines and penalties  which may be far more severe than if the violation had occurred without the consent judgment being in place 
additionally  if we breach the terms of the consent judgment  the sec may petition the court to vacate the consent judgment and restore the sec s original action to the active docket for all purposes 
if the action were restored  the sec could use information in the action that we have provided to the usao  the sec  and other governmental agencies in connection with our cooperation under the consent judgment 
this would include information provided because of our entry into the consent judgment that otherwise may not have been available to the sec or may otherwise have been subject to privilege 
general under both the dpa and the consent judgment  we are obligated to undertake a number of internal reforms including but not limited to adding new management and independent directors  establishing a compliance committee of the board of directors and an executive disclosure committee  establishing new comprehensive records management policies  taking steps to implement best practices regarding recognition of software license revenue  establishing a comprehensive compliance and ethics program  reorganizing our finance and internal audit departments  establishing a plan to improve communication with government agencies engaged in inquiries or investigations relating to the company  enhancing our current hotline for employees to report potential violations of the law or other misconduct  and agreeing to the appointment of an independent examiner  who will serve a term of months subject to extension by the usao and the sec  and will examine and issue reports on our practices to the usao  the sec  and our board of directors beginning no later than september and quarterly thereafter 
in the short term  we cannot predict what impact  if any  the adoption of these reforms including the upcoming reports of the independent examiner may have on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow and they may result in the diversion of management attention and employee resources from core business functions or opportunities 
if it were determined that we breached the terms of the dpa or consent judgment  we cannot predict the scope  timing  or outcome of the actions that would be taken by the usao or the sec 
these actions could include the institution of administrative  civil injunctive  or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and penalties  which may be significant  suspensions or debarments from government product and or services contracts  and other remedies and sanctions  any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our credit ratings and ability to obtain financing  an adverse impact on our stock price  loss of additional senior management  the inability to attract or retain key employees  and the loss of customers 
in addition  under the law  the illegal acts of our employees may be ascribed to us 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  these matters may have on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
as previously disclosed  we have engaged our independent auditors to audit the restated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and this audit has not yet been completed 
moreover  under both the dpa and consent judgment  we are obligated to cooperate with the government in its ongoing investigations of past conduct 
while we do not anticipate any further material adjustments to our financial statements for completed periods  the processes described above have not been fully completed  and we may be required to take additional remedial measures 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of  requires effective planning and management system and process 
we will need to continue to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future 
as a result  we have recently licensed enterprise resource planning software from sap ag and have begun a process to expand and upgrade our operational and financial systems 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to our new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain  achieve accuracy in the conversion of electronic data and records  report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis  and could potentially constitute a breach of the terms of the dpa 
in addition  as we add additional functionality  new problems could arise that we have not foreseen 
such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes  take customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations  and otherwise run our business 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of management s attention and resources  impact our ability to manage our business and our results of operations  cash flows  and our stock price could be negatively impacted 
we may encounter difficulties in successfully integrating companies and products that we have acquired or may acquire into our existing business 
we have in the past and expect in the future to acquire complementary companies  products  services and technologies 
the risks we may encounter include we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further improve our financial and strategic position as planned  we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  we may have difficulty retaining the technical skills needed to provide services on the acquired products  we may have difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines  we may have product liability  customer liability or intellectual property liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products  our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition or integration issues  our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns  we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from governmental authorities under applicable competition and antitrust laws  we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  our relationships with current and new employees  customers and distributors could be impaired  the acquisition may result in increased litigation risk including litigation from terminated employees or third parties  and our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the target company s product quality  financial disclosures  accounting practices  internal control deficiencies  including material weaknesses  product architecture  legal contingencies and other matters 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a large acquisition or number of acquisitions 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  including options  to pay for acquisitions  existing stockholders interests may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
we are subject to intense competition  and we expect to face increased competition in the future 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we expect product and service offerings and pricing competition to increase 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors  and or greater financial  technical  and marketing resources 
competitors for our various products include large technology companies 
we also face competition from numerous smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products 
the competition may affect our ability to attract and retain the technical skills needed to provide services to our customers  forcing us to become more reliant on delivery of services through third parties 
our competitors include large vendors of hardware or operating system software 
the widespread inclusion of products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products and services  or render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
furthermore  even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products  customers may elect to accept the incorporated products rather than purchase our products 
in addition  the software industry is currently undergoing consolidation as software companies seek to offer more extensive suites and broader arrays of software products  as well as integrated software and hardware solutions 
this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
refer to item  business competition  for additional information 
certain software is licensed from third parties 
some of our products contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive 
the loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products 
we may also choose to pay a premium price for such a license in certain circumstances where continuity of the product would outweigh the premium cost of the license 
we do not consider the revenue from products using software licensed from third parties to be material 
however  there can be no assurance that at a given point of time  any of the above will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
certain software we use is from open source code sources 
some of our products contain software from open source code sources 
the use of such open source code may subject us to certain conditions  including the obligation to offer our products that use open source code for no cost 
we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend 
however  the use of such open source code may ultimately subject some product s to unintended conditions so that we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts 
we believe that the use of such open source code will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will be viable after any remediation efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that future conditions involving such open source code will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating environments 
ibm  hp  sun microsystems  and microsoft are the largest suppliers of systems and computing software and  in most cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers 
historically  these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  systems software  and computer hardware 
such new products could  in the future  incorporate features that perform functions currently performed by our products  or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect our earnings if we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
during the past several years  many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets 
our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of our existing distributed systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products 
we have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of our distributed systems products  and expect to have delays in the future 
delays in new product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
discovery of errors in our software could adversely affect our earnings 
the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions  or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be adversely affected 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
these combinations increase our risk further because in the event of a system wide failure  it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault  thus  we may be harmed by the failure of another supplier s products 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  including the inability to do repeat business with existing key customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  increased insurance costs  and failure to successfully complete service engagements for product installations and implementations 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could be time consuming and costly and thus could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial positions 
our credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further 
our credit ratings from moody s and s p were downgraded in the past and s p has recently placed us on negative outlook 
moody s  s p  or any other credit rating agency may further downgrade or take other negative action with respect to our credit ratings in the future 
if our credit ratings are further downgraded or other negative action is taken  we would be required to  among other things  pay additional interest under our credit agreements 
any downgrades could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
we have a significant amount of debt 
as of march   we had approximately billion of debt outstanding  consisting of unsecured fixed rate senior note obligations  convertible senior notes  and unsecured multicurrency credit facilities 
refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and commitments for the payment schedule of our long term debt obligations  inclusive of interest 
we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash provided from operations  and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
however  failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights would weaken our competitive position 
our future success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we protect our proprietary information through the use of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use or copying of our proprietary information is difficult 
unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources 
moreover  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the united states 
for example  shrink wrap or click on licenses may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  patents we have obtained may be circumvented  challenged  invalidated  or designed around by other companies 
our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
refer to item  business proprietary rights  for additional information 
we may become dependent upon large transactions 
we have historically been dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers 
as a result of the flexibility afforded by our business model  we anticipate that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will not be reliant on large dollar enterprise transactions in the future  and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our customers data centers and it environments may be subject to hacking or other breaches if an actual or perceived breach of our customer s network security occurs  allowing access to our customers data centers or other parts of their it environments  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources from development efforts 
additionally  these efforts could cause interruptions  modifications  delays or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers adversely affecting our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our software products  data centers and it environments may be subject to hacking or other breaches although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our data centers and it environments and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
if these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful  our activities could be adversely affected  our reputation and future sales could be harmed  and our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow could be adversely affected 
customer decisions are influenced by general economic conditions 
our products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of our customers information processing resources 
however  a general slowdown in the world economy or a particular region could cause customers to delay or forgo decisions to license new products  to upgrade their existing environments  or to acquire services  particularly with respect to discretionary spending in the software industry  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
third party microcode could impact product development 
we anticipate ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers 
microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are  therefore  less flexible than other types of software 
we believe that such continued use will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will remain compatible with any changes to such code 
however  there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
the software business is marked by easy entry and large  entrenched businesses 
many companies with whom we compete  including ibm  sun microsystems  hp  and other large computer manufacturers  have substantial resources  a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche  as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by us 
additionally  these producers can bundle hardware  software  and services together  which is a disadvantage for us since we do not provide hardware and have far fewer services offerings 
competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry 
some  like microsoft  oracle  and sap  are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets 
in addition  new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis  offering products that compete with those offered by us 
increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry 
additionally  many customers historically have developed their own products that compete with those offered by us 
competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions or displacement of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party operating systems 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system understandable to programmers  object code  which directly controls the hardware  and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as us were able to develop and market compatible software 
microsoft  ibm  and other vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on us 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
the markets for some or all of our key product areas may not grow 
as announced in april  our products will be aligned by software business unit 
our business units will consist of enterprise systems management  security management  storage management  business service optimization bso  and the ca products group which will encompass solutions from a number of ca brands that fall outside of our core areas of systems and security management 
some or all of these areas may not grow  may decline in growth  or customers may decline or forgo use of products in some or all of these product areas 
this is particularly true in newly emerging areas 
a decline in these product areas could result in decreased demand for our products and services  which would adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
third parties could claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement of various forms of their intellectual property 
investigation of these claims  whether with or without merit  can be expensive and could affect development  marketing  or shipment of our products 
as the number of software patents issued increases  it is likely that additional claims  with or without merit  will be asserted 
defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses 
most of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of our products  foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions 
additionally  fluctuations of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar can affect our revenue within those markets  all of which may adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations 
our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant license agreements  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements related to our past accounting issues  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic and international economic and business conditions  general conditions in the software and computer industries  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries that are similar or related to those in which we operate and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock  which in turn could affect the value of our stock based compensation and our ability to retain and attract key employees 
taxation of extraterritorial income could affect our results 
in august  a world trade organization wto dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of eti constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures 
the us government appealed the panel s decision and lost its appeal 
on march   the european union began imposing retaliatory tariffs on a specified list of us source goods 
in order to comply with international trade rules the american jobs creation act of the act repealed the current tax treatment for eti 
the act replaces the eti provisions with a domestic manufacturing deduction and includes transition provisions for the eti phase out 
we are reviewing the provisions of the act and the impact on our effective tax rate 
although the wto has not challenged the act  it remains possible that the wto may once again challenge the new tax benefits as being an illegal export subsidy 
other potential tax liabilities may affect our results 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods in which that determination is made could result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  debt  and installment accounts receivable 
we have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies  such as municipal bonds  and high quality corporate issuers standard poor s single a rating and higher 
to mitigate risk  many of the securities have a maturity date within one year  and holdings of any one issuer  excluding the us government  do not exceed of the portfolio 
periodically  the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
we have shifted from a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments to substantially all fixed rate debt instruments to take advantage of historically low interest rates 
as of march   our outstanding debt approximated billion  approximately all of which is in fixed rate obligations 
if market rates were to decline  we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates 
each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an immaterial annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of march  we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software license agreements 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element  which can vary with the interest rate environment 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business on a worldwide basis through branches and subsidiaries in countries outside the united states 
we are therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates 
as part of our risk management strategy and consistent with prior years  we did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions 
in addition  we manage our level of exposure by denominating a majority of international sales and payments of related expense in the local currencies of our subsidiaries 
a change in all foreign currencies against the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our results from operations 
equity price risk as of march   we have minimal investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies 
these investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
it is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities as part of our investment strategy
