oem relationships 
the company works closely with manufacturers of engineered wood products and oems in developing and expanding the application and sales of simpson strong tie s engineered wood connector products and simpson dura vent s gas  wood and pellet stove venting products 
sst has relationships with several of the largest manufacturers of engineered wood products  and sdv has oem relationships with major fireplace and stove manufacturers 
while the company is expanding its established facilities outside of california to increase its presence and sales in these markets  sales of some products may relate primarily to certain regions 
for example  sales of sst s line of shearwalls  which was expanded recently with the introduction of a steel wall  are concentrated in the western region of the united states since their use is primarily intended to resist the effects of seismic forces 
since  the company has established operations in the united kingdom  opened warehouse and distribution facilities in western canada and the northeastern united states  purchased anchor products manufacturers in illinois and eastern canada and connector product manufacturers in france  denmark  germany and western canada and acquired the assets of a leading manufacturer and distributor of screw fastening systems and collated screws with manufacturing and distribution operations in tennessee and distribution in canada  australia and new zealand 
the european investments are intended to establish a presence in the european community through companies with existing customer bases and through servicing us based customers operating there 
the company also distributes connector and epoxy products in chile  mexico  japan  australia  china and new zealand 
the company intends to continue to pursue and expand operations both inside and outside of the united states see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
a company goal is to manufacture and warehouse its products in geographic proximity to its markets to provide availability and rapid delivery of products to customers and prompt response to customer requests for specially designed products and services 
with respect to the diy and dealer markets  the company s strategy is to keep the customer s retail stores continuously stocked with adequate supplies of the full line of the company s products that those stores carry 
the company manages its inventory to help assure continuous product availability

high levels of manufacturing automation and flexibility allow the company to maintain its quality standards while continuing to provide prompt delivery 
the company s product research and development is based largely on needs that customers communicate to the company 
the company typically has developed to new products annually some of which may be produced in a range of sizes 
the company s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis  to patent them when appropriate and to seek trade secret protection for others 
the company s long term strategy is to develop  acquire or invest in product lines or businesses that a complement the company s existing product lines  b can be marketed through its existing distribution channels  c might benefit from use of the simpson strong tie and simpson dura vent brand names  d are responsive to needs of the company s customers and e expand its markets geographically 
simpson strong tie overview connectors produced by simpson strong tie typically are steel devices that are used to strengthen  support and connect joints in residential and commercial construction and diy projects 
these products enhance the safety and durability of the structures in which they are installed and can save time and labor costs for the contractor 
sst s connector products increase structural integrity and improve structural resistance to seismic  wind and other forces 
applications range from building framing to deck construction to diy projects 
sst produces and markets over  standard and custom products 
in the united states  connector usage developed faster in the west than elsewhere due to the low cost and abundance of timber and to local construction practices 
increasingly  the market has been influenced both by a growing awareness that the devastation caused by seismic  wind and other disasters can be reduced through improved building codes and construction practices and by environmental concerns that contribute to the increasing cost and reduced availability of wood 
most simpson strong tie products are listed by recognized building standards agencies as complying with model building codes and are specified by architects and engineers for use in projects they are designing or supervising 
the engineered wood products industry continues to develop in response to concerns about the availability of wood  and the company believes that sst is the leading supplier of connectors for use with engineered wood products 
metal connectors  anchors and fasteners will corrode and lose load carrying capacity when installed in corrosive environments or exposed to corrosive materials 
there are many environments and materials that may cause corrosion  including ocean salt air  fire retardants  preservative treated wood  dissimilar metals  fumes and fertilizers 
the variables present in a single building environment make it impossible accurately to predict if  or when  significant corrosion will begin or reach a critical level 
this relative uncertainty makes it crucial that the specifiers be knowledgeable of the potential risks and select a product coating or metal that is suitable for the intended use 
changes in the preservative treated wood industry have created additional concerns 
effective december   the preservative treated wood industry voluntarily transitioned from chromated copper arsenate cca c used in residential applications to alternative treatments 
testing has shown that certain alternative replacement treatments are generally more corrosive than cca c 
sst publishes technical bulletins on subjects such as this and others that affect the installation and use of its products and makes its technical bulletins available on its website at www

simpson dura vent overview simpson dura vent s venting systems are used to vent gas furnaces and water heaters  gas fireplaces and stoves  wood and oil burning appliances and pellet stoves 
sdv s metal vents  chimneys and chimney liner systems exhaust the products of combustion to the exterior of the building and have been designed for ease of assembly and safe operation and to achieve a high level of performance 
sdv produces and markets nearly  different venting products 
the clean burning characteristics of natural gas have gained public recognition  resulting in increased market share for gas appliances in the new construction and the appliance replacement markets 
as a result  simpson dura vent has developed venting systems  such as direct vent  to address changes in appliance technology 
fluctuations in natural gas prices  however  affect demand for gas appliances 
historically  sales of wood and pellet burning stoves  considered alternative energy sources  have increased during periods of high oil and natural gas prices and energy shortages while sales of gas burning appliances have tended to decline 
simpson dura vent s objective is to expand market share in all of its distribution channels  by entering expanding markets that address energy and environmental concerns 
sdv s strategy is to capitalize on its strengths in new product development and its established distribution network and to continue its commitment to high quality and service 
sdv operates manufacturing and warehouse facilities in california and mississippi 
products simpson dura vent is a leading supplier of double wall type b gas vent systems  used for venting gas furnaces  water heaters  boilers and decorative gas fireplaces 
sdv s type b gas vent product line features heavy duty quality construction and a twist lock design that provides for fast and easy job site assembly compared to conventional snap together designs 
the twist lock design has broader applications and has been incorporated into sdv s gas  pellet and direct vent product lines 
sdv also markets a patented flexible vent connector  dura connect  for use between the gas appliance flue outlet and the connection to the type b gas vent installed in the ceiling 
dura connect offers a simple twist  bend and connect installation for water heaters and gas furnaces 
consumer concerns over the rising costs of natural gas and home heating oil in and increased demand for alternative fuel appliances 
this has resulted in increased demand for sdv s all fuel chimney and pellet vent products 
the gas fireplace market has evolved into two basic types of fireplace top vent fireplaces that are vented with the standard type b gas vent and direct vent fireplaces that use a special double wall venting system 
sdv s direct vent system is designed not only to exhaust the flue products  but also to draw in outside air for combustion  an important feature in modern energy efficient home construction 
the direct vent gas fireplace systems provide ease of installation  permitting horizontal through the wall venting or standard vertical through the roof venting 
sdv has established relationships with several large manufacturers of gas stoves and gas fireplaces to supply direct vent venting products 
in  sdv expanded its direct vent product line to include both co axial and co linear direct vent systems for venting gas stoves and gas inserts into existing masonry chimneys or existing factory built metal chimneys 
new product development simpson dura vent has gained industry recognition by offering innovative new products that meet changing needs of customers 
sdv representatives serve on industry committees concerned with issues such as new appliance standards and government regulations 
sdv s research and development expense for the three years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
sdv also maintains working relationships with research and development departments of major appliance manufacturers  providing prototypes for field testing and conducting tests in sdv s testing laboratory 
sdv believes that such relationships provide competitive advantages 
for example  sdv introduced the first direct vent system for direct vent gas appliances 
in  sdv developed stainless steel flexible relining systems for masonry chimneys 
these systems are used to resize and retrofit masonry chimneys to accommodate wood burning and pellet burning fireplace inserts 
in  sdv introduced duratech  a twin walled insulated chimney system for use on wood burning stoves  fireplaces and oil fired appliances 
this product line has been designed and manufactured to a new standard of excellence 
it is constructed from stainless steel and incorporates blanket insulation for enhanced safety and efficiency 
in  sdv completed testing for a new chimney product line  dura plus htc  which is designed to meet canadian standards for chimney systems and will be marketed in canada beginning in sales and marketing simpson dura vent s sales and marketing programs are implemented through company sales and marketing staff and a network of independent manufacturer s agents 
sdv markets venting systems for both gas and wood burning appliances through wholesale distributors in the united states  canada and australia to the hvac heating  ventilating and air conditioning and phc plumbing  heating and cooling contractor markets  and to fireplace specialty shop distributors 
these customers sell to contractor and diy markets 
sdv also markets venting products to home center and hardware store chains 
sdv has established oem relationships with several major gas fireplace and gas stove manufacturers  which sdv believes are leaders in the direct vent gas appliance market see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
simpson dura vent responds to technological changes occurring in the industry through new product development and has developed a reputation for quality and service to its customers 
to reinforce its reputation for quality  sdv produces extensive sales support literature and advertising materials 
recognizing the difficulty that customers and users may have in understanding new  complex venting requirements  sdv publishes a venting handbook to assist contractors  building officials and retail outlets with the science of proper venting 
advertising and promotional materials have been designed to be used by distributors and their customers  as well as home centers and hardware chains 
to enhance its marketing effort  sdv has developed a website  www 
duravent 
com  that includes product descriptions  catalogs and installation instructions  as well as a direct link to sdv s customer service and engineering departments 
manufacturing process the company has concentrated on making its manufacturing processes as efficient as possible without compromising quality or flexibility necessary to serve the needs of its customers 
the company has developed and uses automated manufacturing processes 
the company s innovative manufacturing systems and techniques have allowed it to control manufacturing costs  even while developing both new products and products that meet customized requirements and specifications 
the company s development of specialized manufacturing processes also has permitted increased operating flexibility and enhanced product design innovation 
the company sources some products from third party vendors  both domestically and internationally 
the company is committed to helping people build safer structures economically through the design  engineering and manufacturing of structural connectors  pre fabricated shearwalls  anchors and related products 
to this end  the company has developed a quality management system that employs numerous quality control procedures  such as computer generated work orders  constant review of parts as they are produced and frequent quality testing see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
since  simpson strong tie s quality management system has been registered under iso  an internationally recognized set of quality assurance standards 
sst achieved registration under the new iso standard for its operations in north america and england in the first quarter of the maple ridge  bc  and stockton  california  locations achieved registration in and the denmark location achieved registration in early  joining other locations in north america and england that were previously registered 
in  sst expects to achieve iso registration for its operations in france and expects to begin the registration process for quik drive s gallatin  tennessee facility 
the company believes that iso registration is becoming increasingly important to us companies 
simpson strong tie operates manufacturing and warehouse facilities in california  texas  ohio  florida  connecticut  illinois  washington  tennessee  nevada  british columbia  ontario  england  france  denmark  germany  australia and poland 
sst also stocks its products in scotland  austria and chile 
most of sst s products are produced with a high level of automation  using progressive dies run in automatic presses making parts from coiled sheet steel at rates that often exceed strokes per minute 
sst estimates that it produces over one billion product pieces per year 
most of sst s products skus are bar coded with upc numbers for easy identification  and nearly all of the products sold to home centers are labeled with bar codes 
sst has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products because of the need to produce these products close to the customer and to provide backup capacity 
the balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual  blanking and numerically controlled nc processes which include robotic welders  lasers and turret punches 
this capability allows sst to produce products with little redesign or set up time  facilitating rapid turnaround for customers 
new tooling is also highly automated 
dies are designed and produced using computer aided design cad and computer aided machining cam systems 
cad cam capability enables sst to create multiple dies rapidly and design them to high standards 
the company is constantly reviewing its product line to reduce manufacturing costs  increase automation  and take advantage of new types of materials 
for example  in recent years sst has introduced multiple products made from an engineered composite plastic  the anchormate  the strapmate and the anchor bolt stabilizer 
simpson strong tie also manufactures chemical anchoring products at its facility in addison  illinois 
the chemicals are mixed in batches and are then loaded in two part dispensers 
these dispensers mix the product on the job site since set up times are usually very short 
in addition  sst purchases a number of products  primarily fasteners  powder actuated tools and accessories and certain of its mechanical anchoring products  from various sources around the world 
these purchased products undergo inspections on a sample basis for conformance with ordered specifications and tolerances before being distributed 
simpson dura vent operates manufacturing and warehouse facilities in california and mississippi 
sdv produces component parts for venting systems using nc controlled punch presses equipped with high speed progressive and compound tooling 
sdv s vent pipe and elbow assembly lines are automated  to produce finished products efficiently from large coils of steel and aluminum 
upc bar coding and computer tracking systems provide sdv s industrial engineers and production supervisors with real time productivity tools to measure and evaluate current production rates  methods and equipment 
most of the company s current and planned manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes 
for example  the loma prieta earthquake in northern california destroyed a freeway and caused other major damage within a few miles of the company s facilities in san leandro  california  and the earthquake in northridge  california  in january  destroyed several freeways and numerous buildings in the region in which the company s facilities in brea are located 
the company has developed a disaster recovery plan  but it does not carry earthquake insurance on its buildings or its equipment 
other insurance that it carries is limited and not likely to be adequate to cover all of the company s resulting costs  business interruption and lost profits in the event of a major natural disaster in the future 
if a natural disaster were to render one or more of the company s manufacturing facilities totally or partially unusable  whether or not covered by insurance  the company s business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
regulation the design  capacity and quality of most of the company s products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous and extensive regulations and standards promulgated by governmental  quasi governmental and industry organizations 
such regulations and standards are highly technical and complex and are subject to frequent revision 
the failure of the company s products or manufacturing processes to comply with any of such regulations and standards could impair the company s ability to manufacture and market its products profitably and could materially and adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
simpson strong tie s product lines are subject to federal  state  county  municipal and other governmental and quasi governmental regulations that affect product design  development  testing  applications  marketing  sales  installation and use 
most sst products are recognized by building code and standards agencies 
agencies that recognize company products include the international code council icc  the city of los angeles  the state of florida  the state of wisconsin  and the california division of the state architect 
these and other code agencies adopt various testing and design standards and incorporate them into their related building codes 
with the adoption of the international residential code and and the international building code and  these standards have become more uniformly applied and are recognized throughout most of the country 
sst considers code recognition to be a significant marketing tool and devotes considerable effort to obtaining and maintaining appropriate approvals for its products 
sst believes that architects  engineers  contractors and other customers are less likely to purchase structural products that lack the appropriate code acceptance if code accepted competitive products are available 
sst actively participates in industry related professional associations to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide information to regulatory agencies 
simpson dura vent operates under a complex regulatory environment that includes appliance and venting performance standards related to safety  energy efficiency and air quality 
gas venting regulations are contained in the national fuel gas code nfgc  while safety and performance regulations for wood burning appliances and chimney systems are contained in a national fire protection association standard nfpa 
standards for testing gas vents and chimneys are developed by testing laboratories such as underwriter s laboratories ul in compliance with the american national standards institute 
clean air standards for both gas and wood burning appliances are regulated by the environmental protection agency epa 
energy efficiency standards are regulated by the department of energy doe under the authority of the national appliance energy conservation act 
under this act  the doe periodically reviews the necessity for increased efficiency standards with respect to gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
a substantial percentage of sdv s type b gas vent sales are for gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
minimum appliance efficiency standards are being considered that could negatively affect sales of type b gas vents  which could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition if the standards and regulations contained in the nfgc and nfpa are ultimately adopted by national building code organizations such as international code council icc 
in turn  the various building codes could be adopted by local municipalities  resulting in enforcement through the building permit process 
safety  air quality and energy efficiency requirements are enforced by local air quality districts and municipalities by requiring proper ul  epa and doe labels on appliances and venting systems 
competition the company faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates 
this competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers 
while price is an important factor  the company competes on the basis of quality  breadth of product line  technical support  service  field support and product innovation 
as a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes  simpson strong tie s markets tend to differ by region 
within these regions  sst competes with companies of varying size  several of which also distribute their products nationally 
the venting industry is highly competitive 
sdv s competitors include a variety of manufacturers that have operations in usa  canada and mexico 
most of its competitors don t compete in all of sdv s product lines  and some have additional product lines which sdv does not offer 
sdv competes on the basis of quality  service  breadth of product line  technical support  and product innovation 
raw materials the principal raw material used by the company is steel  including stainless steel  and is generally ordered to specific american society of testing and materials astm standards 
sst also uses materials such as epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of it chemical anchoring products 
raw materials such as aluminum  aluminum alloys and ceramic and other insulation materials  are used by simpson dura vent  and cartons  which are used by both sst and sdv 
the company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources 
the company s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers 
the steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the company s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions  competition  labor costs  import duties and other trade restrictions 
steel prices rose in the latter half of and in steel prices may have reached a temporary plateau at their current level but may go higher in the future 
several factors have contributed to these price increases 
the domestic market continues to be heavily influenced by three major us manufacturers 
the world market for steel continues to be strong and the value of the dollar remains low 
all of these factors could have an adverse effect on the company s cost and availability of steel in the company might not be able to increase its product prices to correspond to increases in raw materials prices without materially and adversely affecting its sales and profits 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
patents and proprietary rights the company s subsidiaries have us and foreign patents  the majority of which cover products that they currently manufacture and market 
these patents  and applications for new patents  cover various design aspects of the subsidiaries products  as well as processes used in their manufacture 
the company s subsidiaries are continuing to develop new potentially patentable products  product enhancements and product designs 
although the company s subsidiaries do not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products  the company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that its subsidiaries may develop 
the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that patents will be issued pursuant to pending patent applications 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the same or similar technology  develop around the patented aspects of any of the company s products or proposed products  or otherwise obtain access to the company s proprietary technology 
in addition to seeking patent protection  the company relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its know how or other proprietary information 
in attempting to protect its proprietary information  the company expects that it may sometimes be necessary to initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that the company believes have infringed or are infringing the company s rights 
in such an event  the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation or for other reasons 
if the company were to be unable to maintain the proprietary nature of its significant products  the company s business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
acquisitions and expansion into new markets the company s future growth  if any  may depend to some extent on its ability to penetrate new markets  both domestically and internationally 
see industry and market trends and business strategy 
therefore  the company may in the future pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in addition  future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurring of additional debt  and impairment and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect the company s profitability 
if an acquisition occurs  no assurance can be given as to its effect on the company s business or operating results 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
construction customs  standards  techniques and methods in international markets differ from those in the united states 
laws and regulations applicable in new markets for the company may be unfamiliar to the company and compliance may be substantially more costly than the company anticipates 
as a result  it may become necessary for the company to redesign products or to invent or design new products in order to compete effectively and profitably outside the united states or in markets that are new to the company in the united states 
the company expects that significant time will be required for it to generate substantial sales or profits in new markets 
other significant challenges to conducting business in foreign countries include  among other factors  local acceptance of the company s products  political instability  currency controls  changes in import and export regulations  changes in tariff and freight rates  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to penetrate these markets or that any such market penetration can be achieved on a timely basis or profitably 
if the company is not successful in penetrating these markets within a reasonable time  it will be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments it will have made in attempting to do so 
see business strategy and industry and market trends 
in october  the company completed the acquisition of the assets of quik drive  usa  inc and quik drive canada  inc 
and of the equity of quik drive australia pty 
limited collectively quik drive 
quik drive manufactures collated fasteners and fastener delivery systems which are marketed in the us  canada  australia and new zealand 
the purchase price  including post closing adjustments  of the acquisition was approximately million in cash and million in stock which was not and will not be registered under the securities act of and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements 
in april  the company s danish subsidiary acquired of the shares of atf furrer holz gmbh atf  in switzerland  for approximately million 
atf distributes a line of hidden connectors in some european countries 
in may  simpson strong tie canada limited  a subsidiary of the company  purchased mga construction hardware steel fabricating limited and mga connectors limited collectively  mga  for approximately million in cash 
mga manufactures and distributes throughout canada and portions of the united states a quality line of connectors used in construction 
seasonality and cyclicality the company s sales are seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
with some exceptions  the company s sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters of the year  as retailers and contractors purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season 
in addition  demand for the company s products and the company s results of operations are significantly affected by weather conditions  such as unseasonably warm  cold or wet weather  which affect  and sometimes delay or accelerate  installation of certain of the company s products 
political and economic events can also affect the company s revenues 
the company has little control over the timing of customer purchases  and sales anticipated in one quarter may occur in another quarter  thereby affecting both quarters results 
in addition  the company incurs significant expenses as it develops  produces and markets its products in anticipation of future orders 
because the company maintains high inventory levels  products typically are shipped as orders are received  and accordingly the company generally operates with little backlog 
as a result  net sales in any quarter generally depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
if sales fall below the company s expectations  operating results would be adversely affected for the relevant quarters  as expenses based on those expectations will already have been incurred 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s principal markets are in the building construction industry 
that industry is subject to significant volatility as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  the availability of credit to builders and developers  inflation rates  weather and other factors and trends  none of which is within the company s control 
declines in commercial and residential construction may be expected to reduce the demand for the company s products 
the company cannot provide any assurance that its business will not be adversely affected by future negative economic or construction industry performance or that future declines in construction activity or the demand for the company s products will not have material adverse effects on the company and its business and financial condition

the company also has on occasion found flaws in raw materials and finished goods produced by others 
some flaws have not become apparent until after the products were installed by customers 
many of the company s products are integral to the structural soundness or fire safety of the structures in which they are used 
as a result  if any flaws exist in the company s products as a result of design  raw material or manufacturing flaws or lapses in product quality control and such flaws are not discovered and corrected before the company s products are incorporated into structures  the structures could suffer severe damage such as collapse or fire and personal injury could result 
to the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by the company s product liability insurance  and if the company were to be found to have been negligent or otherwise culpable  the company and its business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the necessity to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury 
furthermore  in the event that a flaw is discovered after installation but before any damage or injury occurs  it may be necessary for the company to recall products  and the company may be liable for any costs necessary to retrofit the affected structures 
any such recall or retrofit could entail substantial costs and adversely affect the company s reputation  sales and financial condition 
the company does not carry insurance against recall costs  and its product liability insurance may not cover retrofit costs

inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value market 
cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition  as follows raw materials and finished goods principally valued at cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
in process products and finished goods cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity 
the company applies net realizable value and obsolescence to the gross value of the inventory 
the company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal 
the company provides for slow moving product by comparing inventories on hand to future projected demand 
obsolete inventory is on hand supply of a product in excess of two years sales of that product or a supply of that product that the company believes is no longer marketable 
the company revalues obsolete inventory as having no net realizable value 
the company has consistently applied this methodology 
the company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
comparable inventory values are as follows december  dollars in thousands gross inventories raw materials in process products finished goods less slow moving  obsolete and net realizable value provisions net inventory valuation the overall increase in the net inventory valuation was million 
this increase was primarily related to increased quantities of raw material inventory on hand of approximately coupled with a increase in the material inventory prices  primarily related to steel  at december  finished goods increased by million  which was primarily related to increased steel costs and the amount of finished goods the company maintains to serve its customers needs and to avoid potential shortages of products 
activity in the inventory reserve is summarized as follows years ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance provisions released following disposal of inventory additional provisions made ending balance a sudden and unexpected change in market demand  building codes or buyer preferences could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete  net of applicable provision for discounts  returns and allowances  whether actual or estimated based on the company s experience 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed and determinable 
the company s general shipping terms are fob shipping point  where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers 
when the company sells fob destination point  title is transferred and the company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities  though significantly less than of net sales and not material to the financial statements  are recognized as the services are completed 
if the actual costs of sales returns  allowances  and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company assesses the collectibility of specific customer accounts that would be considered doubtful based upon the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other factors that the company considers relevant  or accounts that the company assigns for collection 
the company reserves for the portion of those outstanding balances that the company believes it is not likely to collect 
specifically  the company reserves accounts receivable balances that are over days outstanding 
the company also reserves of the amount that it deems potentially uncollectible due to a customer s bankruptcy or deteriorating financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is summarized as follows years ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance adjustments  recoveries and write offs bad debt charges ending balance liquidity and sources of capital the company s liquidity needs arise principally from working capital requirements  capital expenditures and asset acquisitions

these increases were partially offset by increases in trade accounts receivable as a result of higher sales levels  inventories  primarily due to increased quantities of each of the components of the company s inventory and higher priced steel  and income taxes payable aggregating approximately million 
the balance of the cash provided in resulted from changes in other asset and liability accounts  none of which was material 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash paid for capital expenditures and asset acquisitions was approximately million and million  respectively  in  up from million and million  respectively  in the increase in asset acquisitions was primarily due to the acquisition of quik drive in october for the investment in capital expenditures  approximately million was used to purchase or improve the company s real estate  primarily for the company s new  square foot manufacturing and distribution facility in mckinney  texas

in addition  the company realized a net amount of approximately million from the sale or maturity of its short term investments  net of purchases 
the company carries these investments at market value and generally believes an other than temporary decline in its short term investments occurs when the fair value of an investment is below the carrying value for two consecutive quarters
