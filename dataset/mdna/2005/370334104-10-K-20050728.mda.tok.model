item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global consumer foods company 
we develop differentiated food products and market these value added products under unique brand names 
we work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences 
in addition  we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer directed marketing and innovative merchandising 
we believe our brand building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 
our businesses are organized into three segments 
our us retail segment accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal net sales  and reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores  specialty stores  drug  dollar and discount chains  and mass merchandisers operating throughout the united states 
our major product categories in this business segment are ready to eat cereals  meals  refrigerated and frozen dough products  baking products  snacks  yogurt and organic foods 
our bakeries and foodservice segment generated approximately percent of fiscal net sales 
this business segment consists of products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries  to commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators  and to convenience stores throughout the united states and canada 
the remaining percent of our fiscal net sales was generated by our consolidated international businesses 
these include a retail business in canada that largely mirrors our us retail product mix  along with retail and foodservice businesses competing in key markets in europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
in addition to these consolidated operations  we participate in several joint ventures 
we record our proportionate share of after tax earnings or losses from these ventures 
our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term by delivering growth in sales and earnings while improving return on capital  coupled with an attractive dividend yield 
in the most recent fiscal year  general mills total return to stockholders was percent  while the s p index returned percent  from fiscal to  general mills total return to stockholders averaged percent while the s p index posted a negative percent average annual return over this period 
for the fiscal year ended may   our net sales grew percent and diluted earnings per share grew percent including the benefit of gains on divestitures 
details of our financial results are provided in the results of operations section below 
our cash flow in was strong  enabling us to increase our dividend payments  continue to make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity  and reduce our total debt by billion 
results for fiscal were limited by two principal factors 
first  higher commodity costs led to a reduction in our gross margin 
second  we increased list and or targeted promoted prices in several categories in order to partially offset the higher commodity costs 
in some instances  price gaps developed versus competitors  and we subsequently increased trade promotion costs in order to remain competitive 
this was particularly true for promoted prices in the cereal category  where the price gap led to reduced volume and profit for the big g cereal division 
however  slight profit growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment was encouraging  as was the continued success of our international expansion plans 
as we begin fiscal  we are encouraged by the momentum in several of our key businesses 
sustaining that momentum and restoring growth in our us cereal business will be key to achieving our targeted results in in addition  we must renew good earnings growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment 
we face several challenges that will hinder earnings growth in the year ahead 
commodity prices continue to rise  although not as quickly as they did in  and energy costs and our salary and benefit expense are expected to be higher 
these increasing costs will negatively impact our margins  therefore  in order for our plan to be successful we must restore growth in our margin rate 
to offset the increasing costs and grow margins  our plans call for continued realization of price increases we announced in fiscal combined with productivity savings through supply chain and administrative cost saving efforts 
we believe the key driver of our success in will be operating profit growth  which will be driven by product innovation and net sales growth 
our business plans include new product activity and innovations that respond to consumers interest in health and nutrition  convenience and new flavor varieties 
results of operations vs 
our net sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of percent for the year compared to sales in fiscal excluding the effect of the rd week in  net sales increased percent

week basis as if fiscal contained weeks pts absence of rd week pt price product mix foreign currency exchange pts trade and coupon promotion expense pts net sales growth the unit volume growth in fiscal contributed approximately million in gross margin improvement net sales less cost of sales over fiscal however  overall gross margin decreased by million  primarily due to increased cost of sales driven primarily by approximately million in commodity cost increases 
as a result  gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased basis points versus fiscal to percent in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal  primarily driven by four factors a million decrease in consumer marketing expense  a million increase in distribution costs  a million increase in unallocated corporate items and a million decrease in merger related costs 
these merger related costs were items related to the planning and execution of the integration of pillsbury 
net interest expense decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to reduction of debt levels 
interest expense includes preferred distributions paid on subsidiary minority interests 
we have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert million of fixed rate debt to floating rates 
taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps  the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt and subsidiary minority interests was percent 
restructuring and other exit costs were million in fiscal these charges were primarily associated with the supply chain initiatives to further increase asset utilization and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs 
the actions included plant closures and production realignment resulting in asset write downs  severance and related costs 
our fiscal results included restructuring and other exit costs of million 
we recorded a gain of million on two divestitures in fiscal on february   snack ventures europe sve  our snacks joint venture with pepsico  inc  was terminated and our percent interest was redeemed 
on april   we sold our lloyd s barbecue business to hormel foods corporation 
we received million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and the proceeds were used to repurchase debt 
in fiscal  we earned million after tax from sve and lloyd s 
we incurred million in debt repurchase costs in fiscal resulting from the repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes due in the costs consisted of million of noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income  million of purchase premium and million of non cash unamortized cost of issuance expense 
in fiscal our effective income tax rate increased to percent  driven primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal divestitures 
the higher book tax expense related to the fiscal divestitures did not result in the payment of significant cash taxes 
our effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately percent 
after tax earnings from joint venture operations grew percent to reach million in fiscal  compared with million reported a year earlier 
this increase was primarily due to unit volume gains by our continuing joint ventures 
as of may   we were a percent partner in several joint ventures 
our international joint ventures include cereal partners worldwide cpw  our joint venture with nestl  and h agen dazs joint ventures in asia

the effect of eitf reduced our fiscal diluted earnings per share by  and reduced previously reported diluted earnings per share by and for fiscal and  respectively  related to our contingently convertible debt issued in average diluted shares outstanding were million in fiscal  down percent from million in fiscal as the repurchase of million shares from diageo was partially offset by stock option exercises 
net income increased to billion in fiscal  from billion in earnings per diluted share of in were up percent from in primarily due to the redemption of our sve interest  the sale of lloyd s and the reduction in interest expense

impact of inflation it is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years other than as noted above related to commodities 
we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices 
our risk management practices are discussed in the market risk management section below 
cash flows sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following table 
over the most recent three year period  general mills operations have generated billion in cash 
in fiscal  cash flow from operations totaled over billion 
that was up from the previous year due primarily to the change in current assets and liabilities included in cash flows from operations providing million cash in versus using million cash in the fiscal source of cash was due primarily to an increase in accrued taxes as the result of receiving cash benefits from the utilization of capital losses for tax purposes 
the fiscal use of cash was primarily due to lower accrued liabilities  payments against integration and restructuring liabilities  and changes in accrued taxes 
cash sources uses in millions  fiscal year from continuing operations    purchases of land  buildings and equipment  net investments in businesses  intangibles and affiliates  net change in marketable securities proceeds from disposition of businesses other investing activities  net decrease in outstanding debt  net  proceeds from minority investors common stock issued treasury stock purchases dividends paid other financing activities  net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  capital investment for land  buildings  equipment and intangibles decreased to million from million in fiscal we expect capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal dividends in totaled per share  a payout of percent of diluted earnings per share  or percent of diluted earnings per share excluding the net gain from divestitures and debt repurchases 
our board of directors announced a percent dividend increase to an annual rate of per share  effective with the dividend payable on august  the decrease in outstanding debt in fiscal includes the results of debt repurchases 
on march   we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding notes due in the tender offer resulted in the purchase of million principal amount of the notes 
subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer  we purchased an additional million principal amount of the notes in the open market 
the aggregate purchases resulted in the debt repurchase costs described earlier in the results of operations vs 
section 
in may  a wholly owned subsidiary of general mills sold  class a preferred membership interests in general mills cereals llc gmc to an unrelated third party investor in exchange for million 
on october   a wholly owned subsidiary of general mills sold  series b preferred membership interests in gmc in exchange for million 
currently  all interests in gmc  other than the aforementioned interests  but including all managing member interests  are held by wholly owned subsidiaries of general mills 
we used million of the proceeds from the sale of gmc series b interests to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock from diageo plc at per share in october this share repurchase was made in conjunction with diageo s sale of approximately million additional shares of general mills common stock in an underwritten public offering 
following these transactions  diageo and its affiliates held approximately million shares of general mills common stock 
concurrently in october  lehman brothers holdings inc issued million of notes  which are mandatorily exchangeable for general mills common stock 
in connection with the issuance of those notes  an affiliate of lehman brothers entered into a forward purchase contract with general mills  under which we are obligated to deliver to such affiliate between approximately million and million shares of general mills common stock  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
these shares will generally be deliverable by us in october  in exchange for million in cash or  in certain circumstances  securities of an affiliate of lehman brothers 
we recorded a million fee for this forward purchase contract as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
with respect to the holders of minority interests in gmc  the series b interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events  including a decrease in our long term debt rating below either ba as rated by moody s or bb as rated by standard poor s or fitch  inc  or a failure to pay a quarterly dividend on our common stock 
in addition  if gmc fails to make certain required distributions  we will be restricted from paying any dividend other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock or other distributions on shares of our common stock  and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common stock  until such distributions are paid 
the class a interests have the right to request the dissolution and liquidation of gmc upon the occurrence of certain events  including the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries  failure to deliver the preferred distributions  failure to comply with portfolio requirements  breaches of certain covenants  lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa by moody s or bbb by standard poor s  and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests as a result of a breach of gmc s obligations to assist in such remarketing 
in the event of a liquidation of gmc  each member of gmc would receive the amount of its then capital account balance 
the managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase the class a interests 
an election to purchase the preferred membership interests could impact our liquidity by requiring us to refinance the purchase price 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of shares of our common stock subject to a maximum of million shares held in our treasury 
we did not repurchase a significant number of our shares on the open market in fiscal with the completion of our billion debt reduction plan in fiscal  we intend to resume open market share repurchases in fiscal financial condition our total debt was billion as of may   a decrease of billion from may  we also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt structure  and include them in our measurement of adjusted debt plus certain minority interests  as shown in the table below 
in fiscal  our adjusted debt plus certain minority interests declined by billion  to billion  and our stockholders equity grew to billion 
the market value of our stockholders equity increased as well  as an increase in share price was partially offset by a decrease in shares outstanding 
as of may   our equity market capitalization was billion  based on a price of per share and million basic shares outstanding 
our total market capitalization  including adjusted debt  minority interests and equity capital  was billion as of may   down slightly from the total as of may  capital structure in millions may  may  notes payable current portion of long term debt  long term debt   total debt   debt adjustments deferred income taxes tax leases leases debt equivalent certain cash and cash equivalents marketable investments  at cost adjusted debt   certain minority interests adjusted debt plus certain minority interests   other minority interests stockholders equity   total capital   includes zero coupon convertible debentures due in as the result of put provisions exercisable in october the class a interests in gmc and series a interests in general mills capital  inc gm capital are included in adjusted debt plus certain minority interests  whereas the series b interests of gmc are excluded since they are exchangeable for equity in certain circumstances 
at the end of fiscal  approximately percent of our adjusted debt plus certain minority interests was long term 
this includes classifying the zero coupon convertible debentures as short term due to put provisions exercisable in october we consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixed rate obligations 
the following table  when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table  shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments 
debt structure in millions may  may  floating rate  fixed rate   leases debt equivalent deferred income taxes tax leases adjusted debt plus certain minority interests   commercial paper is a continuing source of short term financing 
we can issue commercial paper in the united states  canada and europe  through a program established in fiscal our commercial paper borrowings are supported by billion in committed credit lines 
currently  we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines 
the following table details the fee paid credit lines we had available as of may  committed credit facilities amount expiration core facilities billion january billion january total credit facilities billion on june   we filed a universal shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec covering the sale of up to billion of debt securities  common stock  preference stock  depository shares  securities warrants  purchase contracts  purchase units and units all described in the shelf 
in addition  the shelf covered the resale of approximately million shares of our common stock owned by an affiliate of diageo plc  which was completed in october as described in the cash flows section above 
the sec declared the shelf effective on september  as of may   approximately billion remained available under the shelf for future use 
we believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratios of fixed charge coverage and cash flows from operations to adjusted debt plus certain minority interests 
our fixed charge coverage in fiscal was times compared to times in fiscal  and cash flows from operations to adjusted debt plus certain minority interests increased to percent 
we expect to pay down between and million of adjusted debt plus certain minority interests in fiscal our goal is to return to a mid single a rating for our long term debt  and to the top tier short term rating  that we held prior to our announcement of the pillsbury acquisition 
currently  standard and poor s corporation has ratings of bbb on our publicly held long term debt and a on our commercial paper 
moody s investors services  inc has ratings of baa for our long term debt and p for our commercial paper 
fitch ratings  inc rates our long term debt bbb and our commercial paper f dominion bond rating service in canada currently rates general mills as a low 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
we have  however  issued guarantees of approximately million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates  primarily cpw 
in addition  off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases  which totaled approximately million at may  the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations  including payments due by period 
the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer directed marketing commitments that support our brands 
the fair value of our interest rate swaps was million at may   based on interest rates as of that date 
future changes in interest rates will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those liabilities in the future 
other long term obligations primarily consist of income taxes  accrued compensation and benefits  miscellaneous liabilities and minority interests 
we are unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items 
we do not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our defined benefit retirement and other postretirement benefit plans 
further information on these plans  including our expected contributions for fiscal  is set forth in note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through in item eight of this report 
in millions  payments due by fiscal year total and thereafter long term debt    operating leases purchase obligations   total     includes current portion 
the zero coupon convertible debentures are included in the estimated payments as the result of put provisions exercisable in october if holders of the zero coupon convertible debentures exercise their rights to require us to repurchase the notes in october  we intend to refinance that obligation using sources of financing discussed previously 
critical accounting policies for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  please see note one to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through in item eight of this report 
our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results  and that may require significant management judgment and estimates 
these policies include our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities  asset impairments  income taxes  and pension and postretirement liabilities 
trade and consumer promotion activities we report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs 
the trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf  such as advertising or in store displays  discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices  and payments to gain distribution of new products 
the amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels 
the vast majority of year end liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long term estimates 
for interim reporting  we estimate the annual trade promotion expense and recognize pro rata period expense generally in proportion to revenue  adjusted for estimated year to date expenditures if greater than the pro rata amount 
certain trade and consumer promotion expenses are recorded as reductions of net sales 
promotional funds for our retail businesses are initially established at the beginning of each year  and paid out over the course of the year based on the customer s performance of agreed upon merchandising activity 
during the year  additional funds may also be used in response to competitive activities  as a result of changes in the mix of our marketing support  or to help achieve interim unit volume targets 
we set annual sales objectives and interim targets as a regular practice to manage our business 
our sales employees are salaried  and are eligible for annual cash incentives based on performance against objectives including goals for unit volume and the trade promotion cost per unit required to achieve the unit volume goal 
our sales employees have discretion to plan and adjust the timing of merchandising activity over the course of the year  and they also have some discretion to adjust the level of trade promotion funding applied to a particular event 
our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter 
in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first weeks of a quarter  the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days worth of incremental shipments based on a five day week  reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter 
this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter  as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets 
this increased sales activity results in shipments that are in direct response to orders from customers or authorized pursuant to prearranged inventory management agreements  and accordingly are recognized as revenue within that quarter 
the two to four day range of increased unit volume in the last week of each quarter has been generally consistent from quarter to quarter over the last three years  except that in the third quarter of fiscal  we were slightly below the two to four day range  primarily as actions to raise promoted prices on big g cereals resulted in declines in promoted volume 
if incremental shipments had been within the two to four day range  our reported us retail volume growth for the quarter would have remained unchanged 
as part of our effort to assess the results of our promotional activities  we regularly estimate the amount of retailer inventory in the system defined as product that we have shipped to our customers that has not yet been purchased from our customers by the end consumer 
while it is not possible for us to measure the absolute level of inventory  we are able to estimate the change that occurs each month by comparing our shipments to retail customers with their sales to end consumers as reported by acnielsen 
our estimate indicates inventory levels peak in november when retailers have increased inventories to meet seasonal demand for products like refrigerated dough and ready to serve soup 
this seasonal trend is generally consistent from year to year  even as retailers have taken actions to reduce their ongoing inventory levels 
we also assess the effectiveness of our promotional activities by evaluating the end consumer purchases of our products subsequent to the reporting period 
if  due to quarter end promotions or other reasons  our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end consumer demand will require in future periods  then our sales level in future reporting periods would be adversely affected 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of sales  we also monitor customer returns 
we generally do not allow a right of return on our products 
however  on a limited case by case basis with prior approval  we may allow customers to return products in saleable condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets 
these returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return 
monthly returns are consistently below percent of sales  and have averaged approximately percent of total monthly shipments over the last three years 
asset impairments we are required to evaluate our long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired 
evaluating the impairment of long lived assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets 
although the predictability of long term cash flows may be uncertain  our evaluations indicate fair values for our long lived assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values 
therefore  we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is low 
income taxes income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues 
historically  our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate 
the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items  except for the accounting for losses recorded as part of the pillsbury transaction 
the finalization of the tax benefits related to these losses would be accounted for as a reduction of goodwill 
pension accounting the accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors 
key assumptions that determine this liability and related income or expense include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that match the expected benefit obligations 
the discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date 
that same discount rate also is used to determine pension and other postretirement expense for the following fiscal year 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation  our historical long term investment performance  our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our actuaries  investment services and investment managers  and long term inflation assumptions 
our historical investment performance compound annual growth rates are     and for the     and year periods ended may  in addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of may   we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of approximately million on our pension plans and million on our postretirement plans  primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions 
these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in fiscal  we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of million compared to million in fiscal the discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were percent for the obligation as of may  and for our fiscal income and expense  and percent for the obligation as of may  and for our fiscal income and expense 
for fiscal and  we assumed a rate of return of percent on our pension plan assets and our other postretirement plan assets 
for our fiscal pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate  we have reduced the discount rate to percent for our pension liabilities and percent for our postretirement liabilities  based on interest rates as of may  the expected rate of return on plan assets remains percent 
actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 
new accounting rules the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  in december  which will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant date fair values and recognized over the vesting period 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
the new rule allows companies to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their fiscal year that begins after june  under the new rule  sfas no 
r will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal we are still evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for the fiscal year beginning after june   and is effective for us in fiscal we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after june   and is effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  fsp no 

fsp no 
provides guidance with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp no 
includes a one year reduced tax rate on repatriation of foreign earnings and a phased in tax deduction provided for qualifying domestic production activities 
we are currently evaluating the impact of repatriation provisions as treasury guidance is provided 
however  the range of reasonably possible amounts of unremitted earnings that is being considered for repatriation in fiscal year is between and million with the respective income tax impact ranging from to million based on a percent tax rate 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  fin 
fin requires that liabilities be recognized for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we will adopt fin at the end of fiscal and do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
market risk management we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities 
the counterparties in these transactions are highly rated institutions 
our hedging transactions include but are not limited to the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
interest rates we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and derivatives 
we use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs 
generally under these swaps  we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount 
our primary exposure is to us interest rates 
as of may   we had billion of aggregate notional principal amounts the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated outstanding  including amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps 
see note seven to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through in item eight of this report 
foreign currency rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates 
these contracts function as hedges  since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar  the euro  the australian dollar  the mexican peso and the british pound against the us dollar 
commodities certain commodities used in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks 
we manage this market risk through an integrated set of financial instruments  including purchase orders  noncancelable contracts  futures contracts  futures options and swaps 
our primary commodity price exposures are to grains  vegetables  dairy products  sugar  vegetable oils  meats  fruits  other agricultural products  packaging materials and energy costs 
value at risk these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value general mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates or commodity prices  under normal market conditions 
a monte carlo var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures 
the models assumed normal market conditions and used a percent confidence level 
the var calculation used historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future 
the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations were debt  investments  interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forwards  and commodity swaps  futures and options 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value for our interest rate  foreign currency and commodity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding on may  the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described above
