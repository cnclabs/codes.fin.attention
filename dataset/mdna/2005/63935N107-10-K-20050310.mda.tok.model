business risks in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
such factors could have a significant impact on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company relies heavily on its consulting staff and management team 
the company s inability to retain highly skilled professionals  coupled with departures of a significant number of senior employees  could have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents the company s common stock price may fall and any investment in the company may be materially affected 
any long term decline in the common stock would impair the company s ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
the company uses equity based compensation as a portion of senior and mid level consultants overall compensation packages 
equity based compensation is used to help align the interests of its employees and stockholders  but complete alignment is difficult to achieve 
compensation and retention related issues represent a continuing challenge for the company 
specialized systems and processes have been developed by the company and provide a competitive advantage in serving current clients and obtaining new clients 
this intellectual capital is the property of the company and the unauthorized use could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business 
additionally  many of the company s service offerings rely on technology that is subject to rapid change 
the company s intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 
a new governmental regulation could allow a competitor a significant advantage before the company is able to adapt to newly updated service demands 
the company must manage growth from both organically expanding services and the acquisition of complementary consulting firms 
this growth and integration of acquisitions may cause strain on the company s management team and the company s systems 
excessively rapid growth or unsuccessful integration of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on the future profitability of the company 
the company may not earn an adequate return on capital or may fail to achieve a return of its capital on certain business acquisitions 
the company also may pay a substantial premium on certain business acquisitions 
the financing of these acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
the company s engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to its office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
the company s inability to continually replace a significant portion of current engagements with new engagements would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its current and future commitments 
the company maintains a revolving line of credit agreement to assist in funding short term and long term cash requirements from normal operations 
this agreement contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  a minimum level of earnings 
poor performance of the company could cause the company to be in default of these existing covenants 
additionally  the company cannot be certain that it will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to execute future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectability would likely be required 
the professional reputation of the company and its consultants is critical to the company s ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage the company s professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is subject to the risk of professional liability 
the company s consultants engage in complex analyses in which the exercise of professional judgment is critical 
if services are not performed to the client s satisfaction  a client may threaten or bring a lawsuit against the company  claiming the company performed negligently or breached its obligation to the client 
in certain cases  there is potential that persons other than clients may bring claims against the company 
a claim against the company could exceed the limits of the company s insurance coverage and could damage the company s reputation 

table of contents legislative changes affecting the company s clients  competitors  or staff could have an impact on business 
an example of this is the sarbanes oxley act of  which limits the services that public accounting firms are permitted to provide to their audit clients 
the company is not a public accounting firm and therefore is not subject to such restrictions 
changes to the sarbanes oxley act or rules promulgated thereunder  as well as other legislation  could have an impact on the company s business
