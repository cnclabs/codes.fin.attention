item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations summary as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on september   the company purchased  shares of compx common stock from valhi and a wholly owned subsidiary of valhi  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of compx common stock 
because valhi  nl and compx are all entities under the common control of contran  the company s acquisition of the shares of compx common stock results in a change in reporting entity and the company has retroactively restated its consolidated financial statements to reflect the consolidation of compx for all periods presented 
also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  following the company s july dividend in the form of shares of kronos common stock distributed to nl shareholders  the company s ownership of kronos was reduced to less than 
consequently  effective july  the company ceased to consolidate kronos financial position  results of operations and cash flows and the company commenced accounting for its interest in kronos by the equity method 
the company continues to report kronos as a consolidated subsidiary through june   including the consolidation of kronos results of operations and cash flows for the first two quarters of the deconsolidation of kronos effective july  has a significant affect on the comparability of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in compared to income of million  or per diluted share in and income of million  or 
per diluted share  in the increase in the company s diluted earnings per share from to is due primarily to the net effects of i lower chemicals operating income  ii higher component products operating income  iii lower environmental remediation and legal expenses and iv certain income tax benefits 
the increase in the company s diluted earnings per share from to is due primarily to the net effects of i higher chemicals operating income  ii higher component products operating income  iii higher environmental remediation expenses and iv certain income tax benefits

each of these items is more fully discussed below and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company currently believes its net income in will be lower compared to due primarily to the effects of income tax benefits discussed above recognized in critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
o the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable securities carried at fair value or accounted for under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value below its cost basis for marketable securities or below its carrying value for equity method investees that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
at december   the carrying value of all of the company s marketable securities exceeded the cost basis of each of such investments 
with respect to the company s investment in valhi  which represented over of the carrying value of all of the company s marketable equity securities at december   the million carrying value of such investment exceeded its million cost basis by about 
at december   the per share quoted market price of the company s investment in kronos the only one of the company s equity method investees for which quoted market prices are available exceeded its per share net carrying value by about 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no such impairment indicators  as defined  were present 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
goodwill attributable to the component products operating segment was assigned to three reporting units within that operating segment  one consisting of compx s security products operations  one consisting of compx s european operations and one consisting of compx s canadian and taiwanese operations 
the company s goodwill also relates to an acquisition completed in january no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of the company s annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each such reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit compx security products reporting unit  compx european operations reporting unit and compx canadian and taiwanese operations reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the three compx reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections 
significant judgment is required in estimating the discounted cash flows for the compx reporting units 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that compx will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
in december  compx s european operations met the criteria under gaap to be classified as held for sale and thus was required to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
at such time  the company recognized a million impairment of the goodwill related to such operations  as the carrying amount of the net assets exceed the estimated fair value less cost to sell of the operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  during the company concluded that the more likely than not recognition criteria had been met with respect to the income tax benefit associated with its german net operating loss carryforwards 
kronos has substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that kronos might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
o the company records accruals for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
segment profit for each of the company s two operating segments are impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  as summarized below o chemicals allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investees  goodwill and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension and opeb plans and loss accruals 
o component products allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
in addition  general corporate and other items are impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for impairment of marketable securities and equity method investees  defined benefit pension and opeb plans  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
component products years ended december  change in millions in millions net sales segment profit segment profit margin component products sales were higher in as compared to due in part to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  increased component products sales by million in as compared to component products sales comparisons were also impacted by increases in product prices for precision slides and ergonomic products which were primarily a pass through of raw material steel cost increases to customers 
during  sales of slide products increased as compared to  while sales of security products decreased less than and sales of ergonomic products increased during the same period 
the percentage changes in both slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of security products are generally denominated in us dollars 
component products segment profit comparisons in were favorably impacted by the effect of certain cost reduction initiatives undertaken in component products segment profit comparisons were also impacted by the net effects of increases in the cost of steel the primary raw material for compx s products and continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs 
component products sales were higher in as compared to due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  increased net sales by million in as compared to in addition to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  component products sales increased in as compared to due to the net effects of higher sales volumes of security products  and precision slide products in north american markets partially offset by lower sales volumes of ergonomic products 
during  sales of slide and security products increased and  respectively  as compared to  while sales of ergonomic products decreased 
the percentage changes in both slide and ergonomic products include the impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
component products segment profit income increased in as compared to due in part to the favorable effect of cost improvement initiatives  such as consolidating compx s two canadian facilities into one facility 
component products segment profit comparisons were negatively affected by the expenses associated with such facility consolidation approximately  and increases in the cost for steel 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  as discussed below  decreased segment profit by million in as compared to in addition  component products segment profit in includes charges aggregating million related to the re tooling of one of compx s manufacturing facilities and provisions for changes in estimate with respect to obsolete and slow moving inventories  overhead absorption rates and other items 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted component products sales comparisons with  while currency exchange rate fluctuations did not significantly impact component products segment profit comparisons for the same periods 
during  currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar positively impacted component products sales comparisons with principally with respect to slide products  but currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar negatively impacted component products segment profit comparisons for the same periods 
while demand has improved in across most of compx s product segments  certain customers are seeking lower cost asian sources as alternatives to compx s products 
compx believes the impact of this will be mitigated through its ongoing initiatives to expand both new products and new market opportunities 
asian sourced competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge as asian manufacturers  particularly those located in china  gain market share 
compx has responded to the competitive pricing pressure in part by reducing production cost through product reengineering improvement in manufacturing processes  or moving production to lower cost facilities including compx s own asian based manufacturing facilities 
compx has also emphasized and focused on opportunities where it can provide value added customer support services that asian based manufacturers are generally unable to provide 
compx believes its combination of cost control initiatives together with its value added approach to development and marketing of products helps to mitigate the impact of competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  compx s cost for steel continues to rise dramatically due to the continued high demand and shortages worldwide 
while compx has thus far been able to pass a majority of its higher raw material costs on to its customers through price increases and surcharges  there is no assurance that it would be able to continue to pass along any additional higher costs to its customers 
the price increases and surcharges may accelerate the efforts of some of compx s customers to find less expensive products from foreign manufacturers 
compx will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales  particularly to the office furniture industry  and to develop value added customer relationships with an additional focus on sales of compx s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems to improve operating results 
these actions  along with other activities to eliminate excess capacity  are designed to position compx to expand more effectively on both new product and new market opportunities to improve compx s profitability 
chemicals kronos relative changes in kronos tio sales and income from operations during the past three years are primarily due to i relative changes in tio sales and production volumes  ii relative changes in tio average selling prices and iii relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
selling prices in billing currencies were generally decreasing during the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  increasing during the last half of and the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  decreasing during the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of and increasing during the last half of effective july  the company ceased to consolidate kronos financial position  results of operations and cash flows and the company commenced accounting for its interest in kronos by the equity method

when translated from billing currencies to us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased compared to kronos sales are denominated in various currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap gaap measure 
kronos discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because kronos believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods

chemicals segment profit in includes million of income related to the settlement of a contract dispute with a customer 
as part of the settlement  the customer agreed to make payments to kronos through aggregating million 
the million gain recognized represents the present value of the future payments to be paid by the customer to kronos 
the dispute with the customer concerned the customer s alleged past failure to purchase the required amount of tio from kronos under the terms of kronos contract with the customer 
under the settlement  the customer agreed to pay an aggregate of million to kronos through to resolve such dispute 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kronos segment profit decreased million in as compared to  as the effect of lower average tio selling prices and higher raw material and maintenance costs more than offset the impact of higher sales and production volumes and income from the contract dispute settlement 
kronos segment profit increased million in compared to due primarily to higher average tio selling prices and higher tio sales and production volumes 
kronos tio sales volumes in increased compared to  as higher volumes in european and export markets more than offset lower volumes in canada 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
demand for tio has remained strong throughout  and while kronos believes that the strong demand is largely attributable to the end use demand of its customers  it is possible that some portion of the strong demand resulted from customers increasing their inventory levels of tio in advance of implementation of announced or anticipated price increases 
kronos operating income comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher production levels  which increased 
kronos operating rates were near full capacity in both periods  and kronos sales and production volumes in were both new records for kronos  setting new volume records for kronos for the third consecutive year 
kronos tio sales volumes in increased from  with higher volumes in european and north american markets more than offsetting lower volumes in export markets 
kronos tio production volumes in were higher than  with operating rates near full capacity in both years 
kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased kronos tio sales by a net million in as compared to  and increased sales by a net million in as compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
kronos operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in and compared to the same periods of the respective prior years 
overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net million increase in kronos income from operations in as compared to  and resulted in a net decrease in kronos income from operations in of approximately million as compared to reflecting the impact of partial implementation of prior price increase announcements  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies in the fourth quarter of were higher than the third quarter of in  kronos expects income from operations will be higher than  primarily due to higher expected selling prices in the anticipated higher selling prices in reflects the expected continued implementation of price increase announcements  including kronos latest price increases announced in march the extent to which any of such price increases which have previously been announced  and any additional price increases which may be announced subsequently in  will be realized will depend on  among other things  economic factors 
kronos efforts to debottleneck its production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
kronos production capacity has increased by approximately over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs  with only moderate capital investment 
kronos believes its annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons  with some slight additional capacity available in through kronos continued debottlenecking efforts 
kronos expects its tio production volumes in will be slightly higher than its volumes  with sales volumes comparable to slightly lower in as compared to kronos average tio selling prices  which started to increase during the second half of  are expected to continue to increase during  and consequently kronos currently expects its average tio selling prices  in billing currencies  will be higher in as compared to overall  kronos expects it chemicals segment profit in will be higher than  due primarily to higher expected selling prices 
kronos expectations as to the future prospects of kronos and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond kronos control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos results of operations could be unfavorably affected

interest and dividend income fluctuates in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
aggregate interest and dividend income increased million in compared to primarily due to interest on nl s note receivable from kronos which was not eliminated upon consolidation in the last six months of aggregate interest and dividend income declined million in as compared with primarily due to lower average yields on invested funds 
in addition  average funds invested in were higher compared with the subsequent years primarily due to the decrease in the balance of restricted cash and marketable debt securities over the past three years as such funds were used to pay for certain environmental remediation expenditures of the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects interest income will be lower in than due to lower average yields and lower average levels of funds available for investment

legal settlement gains 
net legal settlement gains of million in   in and  in relate to nl s settlements with certain of its former insurance carriers 
these settlements  as well as similar prior settlements nl reached in and  resolved court proceedings in which nl had sought reimbursement from the carriers for legal defense costs and indemnity coverage for certain of its environmental remediation expenditures 
no further material settlements relating to litigation concerning environmental remediation coverages are expected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
general corporate expenses 
net general corporate expenses in were million lower than due primarily to lower environmental remediation and legal expenses 
net general corporate expenses in were million higher than due primarily to higher environmental remediation expenses principally related to one formerly owned site of nl for which the remediation process is expected to occur over the next several years 
net general corporate expenses in calendar are currently expected to be higher as compared to  primarily due to higher expected legal expenses of nl resulting from an increase in litigation and related expenses 
however  obligations for environmental remediation obligations are difficult to assess and estimate  and no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred in the future with respect to sites for which no estimate of liability can presently be made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense in decreased million compared to primarily due to the deconsolidation of kronos effective july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in increased million compared with primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt of kronos and associated currency effects 
the company does not currently expect to report a material amount of interest expense in provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of the company s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  kronos had previously provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of its tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany because kronos did not believe they met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
during the first six months of  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of its german net operating loss carryforwards  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized 
at june   after considering all available evidence  kronos concluded that these german tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences now met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
under applicable gaap related to accounting for income taxes at interim periods  a change in estimate at an interim period resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance is segregated into two components  the portion related to the remaining interim periods of the current year and the portion related to all future years 
the portion of the valuation allowance reversal related to the former is recognized over the remaining interim periods of the current year  and the portion of the valuation allowance related to the latter is recognized at the time the change in estimate is made 
accordingly  as of june   kronos reversed million of the valuation allowance the portion related to future years  and kronos reversed the remaining million during the last six months of because the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany has now been recognized  kronos effective income tax rate in is expected to be higher than what it would have otherwise been  although its future cash income tax rate will not be affected by the reversal of the valuation allowance 
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
also during  nl recognized a second quarter million income tax benefit related to income tax attributes of ems 
this income tax benefit resulted from a settlement agreement reached with the us irs concerning the irs previously reported examination of a certain restructuring transaction involving ems  and included i a million tax benefit related to a reduction in the amount of additional income taxes and interest which nl estimates it will be required to pay related to this matter as a result of the settlement agreement and ii a million tax benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to certain tax attributes of ems including a us net operating loss carryforward which nl now believes meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in january  the german federal government enacted new tax law amendments that limit the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards effective january  to of taxable income after the first euro million of taxable income 
the new law will have a significant effect on kronos cash tax payments in germany going forward  the extent of which will be dependent upon the level of taxable income earned in germany 
during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
in addition  kronos recognized a million income tax benefit related to the net refund of certain prior year german income taxes 
during  nl and kronos reduced their deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
the provision for income taxes in also includes a million deferred income tax benefit related to certain changes in the belgian tax law 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted into law 
the new law contains several provisions that could impact the company 
these provisions provide for  among other things  a special deduction from us taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic production activities as defined beginning in  and a special dividends received deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations 
both of these provisions are complex and subject to numerous limitations

minority interest 
the company commenced recognizing minority interest in kronos following the company s december distribution of a portion of the shares of kronos common stock to its stockholders  and ceased reporting minority interest in kronos effective july  upon the deconsolidation of kronos 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in nl s subsidiary also relates to ems 
ems was established in  at which time ems contractually assumed certain of nl s environmental liabilities 
ems earnings are based  in part  upon its ability to favorably resolve these liabilities on an aggregate basis 
the stockholders of ems  other than nl  actively manage the environmental liabilities and share in of ems cumulative earnings

the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in such expense in includes one half of the defined benefit pension expense attributable to kronos plans for the period during which the company consolidated kronos results of operations 
the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by the company to all of its plans aggregated million in  million in and million in such contributions in includes one half of the contributions attributable to kronos plans for the period during which the company consolidated kronos results of operations 
the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately of the projected benefit obligation related to nl plans in the u 
s  with the remainder related to an immaterial plan in the united kingdom associated with a former disposed business unit of the company 
the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in the united states and the united kingdom and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us germany canada norway not applicable  as effective july   the company no longer consolidates kronos 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately of the plan assets related to plan assets for nl s plans in the us  with the remainder related to the united kingdom plan 
the company uses several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans the united states and the united kingdom  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o during and  the plan assets in the us were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt  through december  the average annual rate of return has been approximately 
prior to  the company s us plan assets were invested with a combination of equity and fixed income managers 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company s assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows us germany canada norway not applicable  as effective july   the company no longer consolidates kronos 
the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because nl maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and nl s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  nl expects its defined benefit pension income will approximate  in in comparison  nl expects to be required to make approximately  of contributions to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if nl had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its plans as of december   nl s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date 
such a change would not materially impact nl s defined benefit pension expense for similarly  if nl lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of its plans  nl s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb expense of  in   in and million in such expense in includes one half of the opeb expense attributable to kronos plans for the period during which the company consolidated kronos results of operations 
similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  million in and million in such contributions in include one half of the contributions attributable to kronos plans for the period during which the company consolidated kronos results of operations 
substantially all of the company s accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents  and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
as a result  the amount recognized for opeb expense for financial reporting purposes has been  and is expected to continue to be  significantly less than the amount of opeb benefit payments made each year 
accordingly  the amount of accrued opeb expense has been  and is expected to continue to  decline gradually 
the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
in certain cases  nl has the right to pass on to retirees all or a portion of increases in health care costs 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and nl s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate  in in comparison  the company expects the employer contribution portion of costs to approximate million during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately  at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately  at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in foreign operations kronos 
kronos has substantial operations located outside the united states principally europe and canada for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of the company s net investment in kronos will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   kronos had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and british pound sterling 
compx 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally slide and or ergonomic product operations in canada and taiwan 
liquidity and capital resources summary the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flows from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay any short term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends including dividends paid to nl by its subsidiaries 
in addition  from time to time the company will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
also  the company will from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to i repay existing indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
based upon the company s expectations for the industries in which its subsidiaries and affiliates operate  and the anticipated demands on the company s cash resources as discussed herein  the company expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations including operations  capital expenditures  debt service and current dividend policy 
to the extent that actual developments differ from the company s expectations  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected 
the deconsolidation of kronos effective july  has a significant effect on the comparability of the company s consolidated cash flows 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
however  certain items included in the determination of net income are non cash  and therefore such items have no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
non cash items included in the determination of net income include depreciation and amortization expense  deferred income taxes and non cash interest expense 
non cash interest expense relates principally to kronos and consists of amortization of deferred financing costs 
certain other items included in the determination of net income may have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash flows from operating activities will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  equity in earnings of affiliates will generally differ from the amount of distributions received from such affiliates  and equity in losses of affiliates does not necessarily result in current cash outlays paid to such affiliates 
the amount of periodic defined benefit pension plan expense and periodic opeb expense depends upon a number of factors  including certain actuarial assumptions  and changes in such actuarial assumptions will result in a change in the reported expense 
in addition  the amount of such periodic expense generally differs from the outflows of cash required to be currently paid for such benefits 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have no impact on cash flows from operating activities  but such items do impact cash flows from investing activities although their impact on such cash flows differs from their impact on net income 
for example  realized gains and losses from the disposal of long lived assets are included in the determination of net income  although the proceeds from any such disposal are shown as part of cash flows from investing activities 
relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period from when the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
cash flows from operating activities decreased from million provided by operating activities in to million of cash provided by operating activities in this million decrease was due primarily to the deconsolidation of kronos  effective july  as such  cash from operating activities in is not comparable to relative changes in accounts receivable are affected by  among other things  the timing of sales and the collection of the resulting receivables 
relative changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are affected by  among other things  the timing of raw material purchases and the payment for such purchases and the relative difference between production volumes and sales volumes 
relative changes in accrued environmental costs are affected by  among other things  the period in which recognition of the environmental accrual is recognized and the period in which the remediation expenditure is actually made 
cash flows from operating activities increased from million in to million in this 
million increase was due primarily to the net effect of i higher net income of million  ii higher depreciation expense of million  iii million of higher losses on disposition of property and equipment in as compared to  iv lower net distributions from the tio manufacturing joint venture of  in compared to million in  v a lower amount of net cash generated from relative changes in the company s inventories  receivables  payables and accruals and accounts with affiliates of million in as compared to and vi lower cash paid for income taxes of million 
relative changes in accounts receivable are affected by  among other things  the timing of sales and the collection of the resulting receivable 
relative changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are affected by  among other things  the timing of raw material purchases and the payment for such purchases and the relative difference between production volume and sales volume 
relative changes in accrued environmental costs are affected by  among other things  the period in which recognition of the environmental accrual is recognized and the period in which the remediation expenditure is actually made 
nl does not have complete access to the cash flows of its subsidiaries and affiliates  in part due to limitations contained in certain credit agreements as well as the fact that certain of such subsidiaries and affiliates are not owned by nl

provisions contained in compx s revolving bank credit facility could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  the credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business  which provision was waived in conjunction with compx s sale of its thomas regout operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than operating lease commitments disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is not party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements

such capital expenditures included manufacturing equipment that emphasizes improved production efficiency and increased production capacity 
compx received approximately million cash in january upon the sale of its thomas regout operations in the netherlands 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
compx believes that its cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under its bank credit facility  will be sufficient to meet compx s liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends 
to the extent that compx s actual operating results or developments differ from compx s expectations  compx s liquidity could be adversely affected 
compx  which had suspended its regular quarterly dividend of

per share rate in the fourth quarter of compx periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  its capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  compx has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  modify its dividend policy  repurchase shares of its common stock or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  compx may review opportunities for acquisitions  divestitures  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  compx may consider using cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of compx or its subsidiaries 
chemicals kronos at december   kronos had cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of million  including restricted balances of million  and kronos had approximately million available for borrowing under its us  canadian and european credit facilities 
based upon kronos expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on kronos cash resources as discussed herein  kronos expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its future obligations including operations  capital expenditures  debt service and current dividend policy 
to the extent that actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos liquidity could be adversely affected 
at december   kronos outstanding debt was comprised of i million related to kii s senior secured notes  ii million related to kii s european revolving bank credit facility and iii approximately  of other indebtedness 
prior to december   kronos had million of long term notes payable to nl  million of which was subsequently assigned to affiliates upon the acquisition of  shares of compx 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the entire million of long term notes  including the remaining balance owed to nl  was prepaid by kronos in the fourth quarter of pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact kronos earnings and operating cash flows 
cash flow from operations is considered the primary source of liquidity for kronos 
changes in tio pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect the liquidity of kronos 
kronos capital expenditures during the past three years aggregated million  including million million in for kronos ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs and million in related to reconstruction of the leverkusen facility destroyed by fire in march kronos estimated capital expenditures are million  including million in the area of environmental protection and compliance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain income tax examinations currently underway with respect to certain of kronos income tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions  and see note to the consolidated financial statements with respect to certain legal proceedings and environmental matters with respect to kronos 
kronos periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its dividend policy  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  kronos has in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  kronos may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals or other industries  as well as the acquisition of interests in  and loans to  related entities 
in the event of any such transaction  kronos may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing kronos existing debt 
kronos has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amounts of kronos assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore kronos and the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
nl industries parent at december   nl exclusive of compx and kronos had cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of million  including restricted balances of million 
of such restricted balances  million was held by special purpose trusts  the assets of which can only be used to pay for certain of nl s future environmental remediation and other environmental expenditures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain income tax examinations currently underway with respect to certain of nl s income tax returns  and see note to the consolidated financial statements with respect to certain legal proceedings and environmental matters with respect to nl 
in addition to those legal proceedings described in note to the consolidated financial statements  various legislation and administrative regulations have  from time to time  been proposed that seek to i impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead based paint with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and ii effectively overturn court decisions in which nl and other pigment manufacturers have been successful 
examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage  and bills which would revive actions barred by the statute of limitations 
while no legislation or regulations have been enacted to date that are expected to have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  imposition of market share liability or other legislation could have such an effect 
in december  nl completed the distribution of approximately of kronos outstanding common stock to its shareholders under which nl shareholders received one share of kronos common stock for every two shares of nl common stock held 
approximately million shares of kronos common stock were distributed 
immediately prior to the distribution of shares of kronos common stock  kronos distributed a million promissory note payable by kronos to nl of which nl transferred an aggregate of million to valhi and valcor in connection with nl s acquisition of the shares of compx common stock previously held by valhi and valcor  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  nl paid each of its 
per share regular quarterly dividends in the form of shares of kronos common stock in which an aggregate of approximately of kronos outstanding common stock was distributed to nl shareholders in the form of pro rata dividends 
following the second of such quarterly dividends in  nl no longer owned a majority of kronos outstanding common stock  and accordingly nl ceased to consolidate kronos as of july  during the fourth quarter of  nl transferred approximately million shares of kronos common stock to valhi in satisfaction of a tax liability and the tax liability generated from the use of such kronos shares to settle such tax liability 
the transfer of such million shares of kronos common stock  accounted for under gaap as a transfer of net assets among entities under common control at carryover basis  resulting in a reduction of the company s paid in capital of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  nl also sold  shares of kronos common stock in market transactions for an aggregate of approximately million 
on september   nl completed the acquisition of the compx shares previously held by valhi and valcor at a purchase price of per share  or an aggregate of approximately million 
the purchase price was paid by nl s transfer to valhi and valcor of million of nl s million long term note receivable from kronos which long term note was eliminated in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
nl s acquisition was accounted for under gaap as a transfer of net assets among entities under common control  and accordingly resulted in a change in reporting entity and the company has retroactively restated its consolidated financial statements to reflect the consolidation of compx for all periods presented 
after such acquisition  nl retained a million note receivable from kronos  which note receivable kronos prepaid in november using funds from kii s november issuance of euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes 
nl periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its dividend policy  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  nl has in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  nl may review opportunities for acquisitions  divestitures  joint ventures or other business combinations in the chemicals or other industries  as well as the acquisition of interests in  and loans to  related entities 
in the event of any such transaction  nl may consider using its available cash  issuing its equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing nl s existing debt 
because nl s operations are conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and affiliates  nl s long term ability to meet its parent company level corporate obligations is dependent in large measure on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries and affiliates 
in february  kronos announced it would pay its first regular quarterly cash dividend of 
per share 
at that rate  and based on the million shares of kronos held by nl at december   nl would directly receive aggregate annual dividends from kronos of million 
in addition  compx resumed paying quarterly dividends in the fourth quarter of at 
per share 
at that rate  and based on the million shares of compx held indirectly by nl through its ownership interest in compx group at december   nl would directly or indirectly receive aggregate annual dividends from compx of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results of operations as determined by gaap  the company has disclosed certain non gaap information which the company believes provides useful information to investors o the company discloses percentage changes in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies  which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation 
the company believes disclosure of such percentage changes allows investors to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
the company has also periodically entered into currency forward contracts to either manage a nominal portion of foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar risk associated with future sales  or to hedge specific foreign currency commitments 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than as described below  the company was not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion relates to nl and its consolidated subsidiaries at each date indicated 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
nl had no indebtedness at december  or outstanding indebtedness at december  relates to kronos and compx  and outstanding indebtedness at december  relates solely to compx 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under compx s variable rate revolving bank credit agreement 
compx s outstanding borrowings at december  related principally to million in borrowings under such compx credit facility 
the outstanding balances at december  which approximate fair value had a weighted average interest rate of 
the remaining variable rate indebtedness outstanding at december  and is not material 
at december   outstanding fixed rate indebtedness  all of which relates to kronos  aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of 
all of such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in euros 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx held a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through march to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding currency forward contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently 
the difference between the estimated fair value and the face value of all such outstanding forward contracts at december  is not material 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through february to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such contracts is not material at december  and at december   kronos had also entered into a short term currency forward contract maturing on january  to exchange an aggregate of euro million into us dollars at an exchange rate of us per euro 
such contract was entered into in conjunction with the january payment of an intercompany dividend from one of kronos european subsidiaries 
at december   the actual exchange rate was us per euro 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contract was not material at december  as described above  at december  kronos had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million 
marketable equity and debt security prices 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities  which are owned 
the fair value of such debt and equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million at december  and million at december  the fair value of restricted marketable debt securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments assuming a change in prices would be million at each of december  and other 
the company believes there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
