we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies include those policies that involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
we believe that the following policies are critical accounting policies 
for further information on these policies and other significant accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounts receivable our customers are primarily major consumer brand companies and container manufacturers 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in connection with our normal business activities 
accounts receivable include an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific individual risks identified 
losses may also depend to some degree on future economic conditions 
although these conditions are unknown to us and may result in additional credit losses  we do not anticipate significant adverse credit circumstances in fiscal goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
the impairment test is completed based upon our assessment of the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
for purposes of these tests  we have determined that each segment of multi color is one reporting unit 
the annual review for impairment of goodwill requires the use of estimates and assumptions which we believe are appropriate 
application of different estimates and assumptions or reviewing goodwill at a different reporting unit level could produce different results 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred involves various estimates and assumptions  including the determination of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets involved in the review 
the cash flow estimates are based upon our historical experience  adjusted to reflect estimated future market and operating conditions 
measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value 
we base our estimates of fair values on quoted market prices when available  independent appraisals as appropriate and industry trends or other market knowledge 
income taxes according to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis and reported book basis of assets and liabilities and result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
future changes in regulatory tax laws and or different positions held by taxing authorities may affect the value recorded for deferred taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations were  in and  in  and increased primarily due to an increase in net income 
cash flows used in investing activities were  in and  in increase in cash used is primarily due to the acquisition of nspg in january for  capital expenditures were  in and  in capital expenditures were funded either through cash flow from operations or through borrowing under the company s credit agreement 
capital expenditures in related primarily to a new gravure press in our scottsburg  in plant and a new business information system 
budgeted capital expenditures for of approximately  are expected to be funded from operating cash flows 
in  multi color amended its credit agreement in order to provide for a revolving line of credit revolver up to a maximum of  and a non revolving line of credit facility non revolver not to exceed  of which  was borrowed in connection with the acquisition of nspg 
the lenders have no obligation to make any advances under the non revolver after the draw termination date of january  under the terms of the amended credit agreement  multi color is subject to several financial covenants 
the financial covenants require multi color to maintain certain leverage and fixed charge ratios as well as maintain a minimum net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants during our amended credit agreement allows us to pay dividends up to  in any given year 
the amended credit agreement expires august  available borrowings under the credit agreement at march  consisted of  under the revolver and  under the non revolver 
we believe that cash flow from operations and availability under the credit agreement  as amended  are sufficient to meet our capital requirements and debt service requirements for fiscal and for the next several fiscal years 
from time to time  we 
table of contents review potential acquisitions of businesses 
while we have no present commitments to acquire any businesses that would have a material impact on multi color s financial position or results of operations  any such acquisition would require us to issue additional equity or incur additional debt 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of march  thousands total year year year year year more than years long term debt rent due under capital lease obligations rent due under operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations amount includes of expected post retirement benefit obligations and of deferred compensation obligations 
the deferred compensation obligations are included in the more than years column as the timing of such payments are not determinable refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation we do not believe that our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
financial measures that supplement gaap we referred to data derived from consolidated financial statements but not required by gaap to be presented in financial statements 
certain of these data are considered to be non gaap financial measures under the sec regulations 
specifically  we referred to net income excluding the plant closure costs and impairment loss and gross profit excluding the gross profit shortfall generated by the las vegas plant 
we believe these costs to be unusual items and believe that investors may find it helpful to see the measures noted above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk thousands multi color is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates on certain of its outstanding debt 
the outstanding loan balance under our bank credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based on prevailing short term interest rates in the united states and europe 
based on the average outstanding debt in fiscal  a basis point change in the interest rate would change interest expense by approximately in fiscal  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in order to provide a hedge against a portion of our variable interest rate debt and as a result  approximately of total debt at march  was variable interest rate debt 
the market value of these swaps is at march  and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in fiscal  we did not use financial or derivative instruments to manage our interest risks 
multi color has minimal foreign exchange risks
