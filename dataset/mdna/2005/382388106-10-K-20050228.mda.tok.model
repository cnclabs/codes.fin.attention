our former avionics business  passenger restraint systems business prs and engineered industrial products segment have been accounted for as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise noted herein  disclosures pertain only to our continuing operations 
overview we are one of the largest worldwide suppliers of aerospace components  systems and services to the commercial  regional  business and general aviation markets 
we are also a leading supplier of systems and products to the global military and space markets 
our business is conducted globally with manufacturing  service and sales undertaken in various locations throughout the world 
our products and services are principally sold to customers in north america  europe and asia 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
sales for the year ended december  were  million 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
sales for the year ended december  were  million 
foreign currency translation was responsible for approximately million of the million increase in sales 
the remaining increase resulted primarily from increased sales of military and space  large commercial aircraft aftermarket and regional  business and general aviation original equipment and aftermarket parts and services 
net income for both periods included certain charges  including charges for the partial settlement with northrop grumman related to the acquisition of trw s aeronautical systems businesses  as described in the results of operations and business segment performance sections 
in addition  on january   we changed certain aspects of our contract accounting policy and began expensing stock based compensation 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december   increased million over the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to reduced charges for facility closure and headcount reduction actions and reduced asset impairment expenses which totaled million after tax per diluted share for the year ended december  and million after tax per diluted share for the year ended december  also  in the year ended december   we reported a charge for the partial settlement with northrop grumman of million after tax  or per diluted share  charges for premiums and associated costs related to the early retirement of long term debt of million after tax  or per diluted share  and a charge for the early conclusion of boeing production of million after tax  or per diluted share 
the results included a charge for the early termination of original equipment oe deliveries of pw engine nacelle components of million after tax  or per diluted share  and a gain on the sale of the noveon international  inc payment in kind notes noveon pik notes issued to us in in connection with the sale of the performance materials segment of million after tax  or per diluted share 
these items  which totaled million after tax  or per diluted share  during the year ended december   were reduced to million after tax  or per diluted share  during the year ended december  in the year ended december   we experienced reduced earnings relating to foreign 
table of contents currency translation of non us dollar net expenses of approximately million after tax  or per diluted share  compared to the year ended december  also in the year ended december   we experienced reduced earnings totaling approximately million after tax  or per diluted share  compared to the year ended december   relating to certain medical expenses  liability insurance premiums  litigation costs and performance based management incentive compensation expenses 
we also adjusted our effective tax rate to percent during the year ended december  compared to percent during the year ended december  the lower rate in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  reflected favorable state and foreign tax settlements  adjustments related to state income taxes and finalization of our federal tax return  offset in part by additional reserves for certain income tax issues 
we recorded income from discontinued operations of million during the year ended december   associated with the gain on the sale of our avionics business 
net cash from operating activities was million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the year ended december  included cash received from the partial settlement with northrop grumman of million 
worldwide pension contributions increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  net cash from operating activities included tax refunds of million in the year ended december  there were net income tax payments during the year ended december  of approximately million 
net cash from operating activities in the year ended december  included cash received from the termination of certain life insurance policies of million and commutation of a general liability insurance policy of million  offset in part by a reduction of million in receivables sold under our receivables securitization program and the acquisition of certain aftermarket rights of million 
net cash used by investing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the year ending december  net cash used by investing activities included million of capital expenditures in the year ended december  as compared with million in the year ended december  proceeds of million from the sale of the noveon pik notes provided net cash to investing activities in the year ended december  net cash used by financing activities was million in the year ended december  which was primarily due to the repurchase of million principal value of long term debt  the redemption of the million of cumulative quarterly income preferred securities  series a quips debentures  the redemption of million of special facilities airport revenue bonds  the redemption of million of industrial revenue bonds and common stock dividend payments of million 
net cash used by financing activities was million in the year ended december  primarily due to the repayment of debt with the proceeds from the sale of the avionics business and the sale of the noveon pik notes 
long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations  at december  was  million compared to  million at december  at december   we had cash and marketable securities of million as compared to million at december  the reduction in debt and cash and marketable securities from the december  levels resulted primarily from the repayment of the quips debentures  the redemption of special facilities airport revenue bonds and industrial revenue bonds  the repurchase of long term debt and the revision of the accounting treatment of a technology development grant from a non us government entity 

table of contents we maintain a committed syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in august that permits borrowing  including letters of credit  up to a maximum of million 
at december   there were no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
at december   we had borrowing capacity under this facility of million  after reductions for letters of credit outstanding 
at december   we maintained million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and million of uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities with various banks to meet short term borrowing requirements 
at december   there were no borrowings under these facilities 
we maintain a shelf registration that allows us to issue up to billion of debt securities  series preferred stock  common stock  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
our sales for are expected to grow about to percent from levels  to a range of billion to billion 
margin growth in excess of the growth in sales is expected to result in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of per share to per share  an increase of to percent from the diluted earnings from continuing operations 
we expect cash flow from operations  minus capital expenditures  to exceed percent of net income in we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
refer to outlook for specific assumptions relating to our outlook for our business balance across the aerospace and defense markets continues to be an important strategic aspect of our business 
we believe that trends in these markets will have an important impact on future sales 
looking at our sales by market channel  military and space sales represented approximately percent of sales  total commercial aircraft original equipment sales  including regional  business and general aviation original equipment sales  represented approximately percent of our sales and total commercial aircraft aftermarket sales for these same aircraft and for aircraft heavy maintenance represented approximately percent of sales 
other areas  including industrial gas turbine components  made up the remaining percent 
overall  our aftermarket sales both for commercial aircraft and in the military and space markets represented approximately percent of total sales 
we are currently under contract to supply components and systems for a number of new commercial and military aircraft programs  including the airbus a and a  the boeing dreamliner  the embraer and the lockheed martin f joint striker fighter  which should fuel consistent long term growth 
we expect continued growth in our key markets in in this environment  we are carefully focused on resource allocation to deliver maximum long term value for all of our stakeholders 
outlook sales for are expected to grow about to percent from levels  to a range of billion to billion 
margin growth in excess of the growth in sales is expected to result in diluted earnings per share eps from continuing operations in the range of per share to per share  an increase of to percent from the diluted eps from continuing operations 
our outlook assumes an effective tax rate of percent for  compared to percent in our outlook is based on the following market assumptions deliveries of airbus and boeing large commercial aircraft are expected to be significantly higher in  compared to airbus and boeing reported actual deliveries for of aircraft 
their deliveries for are expected to increase by approximately percent  to about aircraft 

table of contents capacity in the global airline system  as measured by available seat miles asms  is expected to continue to grow 
we expect global asm growth of about percent in  compared to our sales to airlines for large commercial and regional aircraft aftermarket parts and service are expected to grow approximately in line with increases in capacity 
total regional and business aircraft production is expected to be relatively flat in  compared to  as deliveries of business jets are expect to increase  offsetting the expected decrease in regional aircraft deliveries 
military sales oe and aftermarket are expected to increase roughly in line with global military budgets  which are expected to grow in the low single digit range for  compared to we expect cash flow from operations  minus capital expenditures  to exceed percent of net income in we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
the current earnings and cash flow from operations outlook for does not include resolution of the previously disclosed rohr and coltec tax litigation or any premiums and associated costs  or interest expense savings related to further early retirement of debt during we currently expect to continue our debt reduction efforts with a target of million to million in debt reduction in results of operations changes in accounting methods effective january   we changed two aspects of the application of contract accounting to preferable methods for our aerostructures business  which is included in the engine systems segment 
the first is a change to the cumulative catch up method from the reallocation method for accounting for changes in contract estimates of revenue and costs 
the change was effected by adjusting contract profit rates from the balance to complete gross profit rate to the estimated gross profit rate at completion of the contract 
the second change related to pre certification costs 
under the old policy  pre certification costs exceeding the level anticipated in our original investment model used to negotiate contractual terms were expensed when determined regardless of overall contract profitability 
under the new policy  pre certification costs  including those in excess of original estimated levels  will be included in total contract costs used to evaluate overall contract profitability 
the impact of the changes in accounting method was to record a million after tax gain million before tax gain as a cumulative effect of change in accounting 
had these methods of accounting been in effect during  the segment operating income as previously reported for the engine systems segment  as well as our total operating income for the year ended december   would have been million lower 
had these methods of accounting been in effect during  the segment operating income as previously reported for the engine systems segment  as well as our total operating income for the year ended december   would have been million lower 
also effective january   we changed our method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we previously accounted for stock based compensation under apb no 
we have adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for stock based compensation fasb no 
and financial accounting standard no

fas accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the effect of the medicare act was measured as of january  and is now reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the effect of the medicare act is a million reduction of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our retiree benefit plans as well as a reduction in the net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
the effect of the reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit cost is an increase to before tax income from continuing operations of million million after tax for the year ended december  partial settlement with northrop grumman during the fourth quarter  we entered into a million partial settlement agreement with northrop grumman relating to our acquisition of trw s aeronautical systems businesses in october the partial settlement agreement primarily relates to customer warranty and other contract claims for products that were designed  manufactured or sold by trw prior to our purchase of aeronautical systems 
under the terms of the settlement  we have assumed certain liabilities associated with future customer warranty and other contract claims for these products 
the settlement excluded amounts associated with any claims that we may have against northrop grumman relating to the airbus actuation systems development program and certain other liabilities retained by trw under the acquisition agreement 
as a result of the partial settlement  we recorded a liability for the estimated undiscounted future liabilities of million that we assumed 
we recorded a charge of million to cost of sales representing the amount by which our estimated undiscounted future liabilities plus our receivable from northrop grumman for these matters exceeded the settlement amount

approximately percent of pension expense in was recorded in segment operating income 
foreign exchange also negatively impacted the financial results in our business segments 
in  approximately percent of our revenues and percent of our costs were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over percent of these net costs were in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars

on a weighted basis  the us dollar declined about percent against these currencies in changes in sales and segment operating income are discussed within the business segment performance section below 
corporate general and administrative costs of million for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher non qualified pension costs and higher incentive compensation costs 
corporate general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were percent in the year ended december  and december  net interest expense increased million  or percent  primarily due to interest of million on the million of long term debt issued in the fourth quarter of to partially finance the acquisition of aeronautical systems 
net interest expense also increased due to lower interest income of million  primarily due to the sale of the noveon pik notes in the first quarter of lower short term debt in as compared to somewhat mitigated interest expense by approximately million 
other income expense net increased by million  or percent  to expense of million in the year ended december  from expense of million in the year ended december  the increase in expense resulted from the impairment of our equity investment in cordiem llc of million in and the absence in of an million gain on the sale of an intangible asset and a million gain from the sale of a portion of an

goodwill and other intangible assets 
based upon the impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that goodwill relating to the aviation technical services ats reporting unit  reported in the airframe systems segment  had been impaired 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge  representing total goodwill of the ats reporting unit 
the goodwill write off was non deductible for tax purposes 
business segment performance our operations are reported as three business segments airframe systems  engine systems and electronic systems 
effective january   we realigned the business units within our three reportable segments 
these segments are described in note o business segment information to our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the customer services business unit that supports aftermarket products for the businesses that were acquired as part of aeronautical systems was transferred from the airframe systems segment to the engine systems segment to better align our enterprise resources with our global customer base and to streamline the business to support future growth 
in addition  the costs and sales associated with products or services provided to customers through the customer services business are allocated to the business providing the product or service rather than allocated to the customer services business

engine systems engine systems segment sales in the year ended december  of  million increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was due to the following sales associated with the acquisition of the aeronautical systems businesses in this segment  which represented approximately million for the first nine months of  and higher sales of aerostructures military and mro businesses 
the increase in engine systems segment sales was partially offset by lower aerostructures oe and aftermarket spares sales  and declines in demand for industrial gas turbine components resulting in lower sales of engine components and fuel delivery systems 
engine systems segment operating income decreased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  segment operating income was lower due to non cash write downs of inventory and long term receivables relating to the super re engining program of million and the million non cash asset impairment of a facility held for sale in the year ended december   a million charge for a contract termination for the pw engine nacelles in the year ended december   a favorable reserve adjustment of million related to the implementation of a new sap system at aerostructures in the year ended december  that did not recur in the year ended december   and reduced volume  higher initial costs for the next generation cargo systems introduced in the first quarter and higher pension cost 
the decrease in engine systems segment operating income was partially offset by contract loss provisions on five contracts of million in the aerostructures business in the year ended december  that did not recur in the year ended december  the loss provisions resulted from increased overhead rates  due in part to a lower manufacturing base as volume declined consistent with the lower level of aircraft production rates  a charge of million for the inventory step up adjustment related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems in the year ended december  the inventory for the aeronautical systems business in the engine systems segment was increased to record the inventory at its fair market value at the time of the acquisition

foreign operations we are engaged in business in foreign markets 
our manufacturing and service facilities are located in australia  canada  china  england  france  germany  india  indonesia  mexico  poland  scotland and singapore 
we market our products and services through sales subsidiaries and distributors in a number of foreign countries 
we also have joint venture agreements with various foreign companies 
currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations  including foreign affiliates 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers  and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by the unavailability of dollar exchange or other restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 
we do not believe that such restrictions or regulations would have a materially adverse effect on our business  in the aggregate

liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of cash  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
we believe that our internal liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans and also provide adequate financial flexibility

at december   there were no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
the level of unused borrowing capacity under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility varies from time to time depending in part upon our consolidated net worth and leverage ratio levels 
in addition  our ability to borrow under this facility is conditioned upon compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement  including the consolidated net worth requirement and maximum leverage ratio 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
as of december   we had borrowing capacity under this facility of million  after reductions for letters of credit outstanding 
at december   we maintained million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and million of uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities with various banks to meet short term borrowing requirements 
as of december  and december   there were no borrowings under these facilities 
these credit facilities are provided by a small number of commercial banks that also provide us with committed credit through the syndicated revolving credit facility and with various cash management  trust and other services 
our credit facilities do not contain any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness 
however  a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the interest rate and fees payable under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility 
such a downgrade also could adversely affect our ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such new facilities 
quips on march   we completed the redemption of all of the million in outstanding cumulative quarterly income preferred securities  series a quips issued by bfgoodrich capital  a delaware business trust  all of the common equity of which is owned by us

we also revised the accounting for a technology development grant from a non us government entity resulting in a reduction of long term debt of million  which had no cash impact 
the earliest maturity of a material long term debt obligation is december we also maintain a shelf registration statement that allows us to issue up to billion of debt securities  series preferred stock  common stock  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize several forms of off balance sheet financing arrangements 
at december   these arrangements included undiscounted minimum future lease receivables payments sold dollars in millions tax advantaged operating leases standard operating leases short term receivables securitization program lease agreements we finance our use of certain equipment  including corporate aircraft  under committed lease arrangements provided by financial institutions 
certain of these arrangements allow us to claim a deduction for the tax depreciation on the assets  rather than the lessor  and allow us to lease equipment having a maximum unamortized value of million at december  at december   million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these arrangements 
the other arrangements are standard operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under the standard operating leases approximated million at december  under certain operating lease agreements  we receive rent holidays which represent periods of free or reduced rent 
rent holidays are recorded as a liability and recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
in addition  we may receive incentives or allowances from the lessor as part of the lease agreement 
we recognize these payments as a liability and amortize them as reductions to lease expense over the lease term 
we capitalize leasehold improvements and amortize them over the lesser of the lease term or the asset s useful life 
sale of receivables at december   we had in place a variable rate trade receivables securitization program pursuant to which we could sell receivables up to a maximum of million 
accounts receivable sold under this program were million at december  continued 
table of contents availability of the securitization program is conditioned upon compliance with covenants  related primarily to operation of the securitization  set forth in the related agreements 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
the securitization does not contain any credit rating downgrade triggers pursuant to which the program could be terminated 
cash flow hedges we have subsidiaries that conduct a substantial portion of their business in euros  great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars and polish zlotys  but have significant sales contracts that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately percent of our revenues and approximately percent of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over percent of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
periodically  we enter into forward contracts to exchange us dollars for euros  great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars  and polish zlotys to hedge a portion of our exposure 
when the us dollar weakens  our unhedged net costs rise in us dollar terms and our average hedge rates also rise over time 
the forward contracts described above are used to mitigate the potential volatility of earnings and cash flow arising from changes in currency exchange rates that impact our non us dollar sales and expenses 
the forward contracts are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the forward contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with the net change in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
the notional value of the forward contracts at december  was million 
the fair value of the forward contracts at december  was an asset of million  of which million is recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and million is recorded in other assets 
the total fair value of the forward contracts of million before deferred taxes of million  including terminated forward contracts as discussed below  were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and were reflected in income as the individual contracts matured  which will offset the earnings effect of the hedged item 
as of december   the portion of the million fair value that would be reclassified into earnings as an increase in sales to offset the effect of the hedged item in the next months is a gain of million 
in  we terminated certain forward contracts prior to their scheduled maturities in and received cash of million 
as of december   all of the gain was reflected in income and sales when the original forward contracts would have matured 
fair value hedges in september  we terminated an interest rate swap agreement  prior to its maturity in  on our million in principal amount of percent senior notes due in at termination  we received million in cash  comprised of a million receivable representing the amount owed on the interest rate swap from the previous settlement date and million representing the fair value of the interest rate swap at the time of termination 
the carrying amount of the notes was increased by million representing the fair value of the debt due to changes in interest rates for the period hedged 
this amount is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 
in july  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in in october  we entered into two million fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
one million swap is on our percent senior notes due in and the other million swap is on our percent medium term notes due in in december  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in the purpose of entering into these swaps was to 
table of contents increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
the settlement and maturity dates on each swap are the same as those on the related notes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as fair value hedges and the carrying value of the notes has been adjusted to reflect the fair values of the related interest rate swaps 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability loss of million at december  other forward contracts as a supplement to our foreign exchange cash flow hedging program  in january we began to enter into forward contracts to manage our foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
the gains or losses on these forward contracts are being recorded in earnings when realized in order to mitigate the earnings impact of the translation of net monetary assets 
as of december   we had forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  contracts with a notional value of million to buy euros and contracts with a notional value of million to sell canadian dollars 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following charts reflect our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires performance by us pursuant to a funding commitment

table of contents as of december   we had in place a a committed syndicated revolving credit facility which expires in august and permits borrowing up to a maximum of million  b million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities  and c million of uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities 
as of december   we had borrowing capacity under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility of million 
the table excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits obligations 
we made pension contributions of million and million worldwide in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these contributions include both voluntary and required employer contributions  as well as pension benefits paid directly by us 
of these amounts  million and million were contributed voluntarily to the qualified us trust in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to million worldwide during our postretirement benefits other than pensions are not required to be funded in advance  so benefit payments  including medical costs and life insurance  are paid as they are incurred

contingencies general there are pending or threatened against us or our subsidiaries various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings  all arising from the ordinary course of business with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  which seek remedies or damages 
we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving tax  contract  patent protection  environmental and other matters 
gain contingencies  if any  are recognized when they are realized 
legal costs are generally expensed when incurred 
environmental we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations  including sites at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under these laws 
the measurement of environmental liabilities by us is based on currently available facts  present laws and regulations and current technology 
such estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation  the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities and the professional judgment of our environmental specialists in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties 
table of contents regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  the range of remediation alternatives available  evolving remediation standards  imprecise engineering evaluations and estimates of appropriate cleanup technology  methodology and cost  the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accordingly  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed  it is likely that adjustments in our accruals will be necessary to reflect new information 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but the amounts  and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued  are not reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information  however  we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
environmental liabilities  including legal costs  are recorded when our liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable  which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have recommended a remedy or have committed to an appropriate plan of action 
the liabilities are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation proceed  adjustments are made as necessary 
liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 
our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation obligations of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
at december  and december   million and million  respectively  of the accrued liability for environmental remediation was included in current liabilities as accrued expenses 
at december  and december   million and million  respectively  was associated with ongoing operations and million and million  respectively  was associated with businesses previously disposed of or discontinued 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site  including the nature and extent of contamination  the number of potentially responsible parties  the timing of regulatory approvals  the complexity of the investigation and remediation  and the standards for remediation 
we expect that we will expend present accruals over many years  and will complete remediation in less than years on all sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party 
this period includes operation and monitoring costs that are generally incurred over to years 
asbestos we and a number of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various actions by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers in products  or which may have been present in our facilities 
a number of these cases involve maritime claims  which have been and are expected to continue to be administratively dismissed by the court 
these actions primarily relate to previously owned businesses 
we believe that pending and reasonably anticipated future actions  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents there can be no assurance  however  that future legislative or other developments will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 
we believe that we have substantial insurance coverage available to us related to any remaining claims 
however  the primary layer of insurance coverage for some of these claims is provided by the kemper insurance companies 
kemper has indicated that  due to capital constraints and downgrades from various rating agencies  it has ceased underwriting new business and now focuses on administering policy commitments from prior years 
kemper has also indicated that it is currently operating under a run off plan approved by the illinois department of insurance 
we cannot predict the impact of kemper s financial position on the availability of the kemper insurance 
in addition  a portion of our primary and excess layers of general liability insurance coverage for some of these claims was provided by insurance subsidiaries of london united investments plc kwelm 
kwelm is insolvent and in the process of distributing its assets and dissolving 
in september  we entered into a settlement agreement with kwelm pursuant to which we agreed to give up our rights with respect to the kwelm insurance policies in exchange for million 
the settlement amount is subject to increase under certain circumstances 
the settlement represents a negotiated payment for our loss of insurance coverage  as we no longer have the kwelm insurance available for claims that would have qualified for coverage 
the settlement amount of million was recorded as a deferred settlement credit 
liabilities of divested businesses asbestos at the time of the eip spin off in  two subsidiaries of coltec were defendants in a significant number of personal injury claims relating to alleged asbestos containing products sold by those subsidiaries 
it is possible that asbestos related claims might be asserted against us on the theory that we have some responsibility for the asbestos related liabilities of enpro  coltec or its subsidiaries  even though the activities that led to those claims occurred prior to our ownership of any of those subsidiaries 
also  it is possible that a claim might be asserted against us that coltec s dividend of its aerospace business to us prior to the spin off was made at a time when coltec was insolvent or caused coltec to become insolvent 
such a claim could seek recovery from us on behalf of coltec of the fair market value of the dividend 
a limited number of asbestos related claims have been asserted against us as successor to coltec or one of its subsidiaries 
we believe that we have substantial legal defenses against these claims  as well as against any other claims that may be asserted against us on the theories described above 
in addition  the agreement between enpro and us that was used to effectuate the spin off provides us with an indemnification from enpro covering  among other things  these liabilities 
the success of any such asbestos related claims would likely require  as a practical matter  that coltec s subsidiaries were unable to satisfy their asbestos related liabilities and that coltec was found to be responsible for these liabilities and was unable to meet its financial obligations 
we believe any such claims would be without merit and that coltec was solvent both before and after the dividend of its aerospace business to us 
if we are ultimately found to be responsible for the asbestos related liabilities of coltec s subsidiaries  we believe it would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in a particular period 
however  because of the uncertainty as to the number  timing and payments related to future asbestos related claims  there can be no assurance that any such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if a claim related to the dividend of coltec s aerospace business were successful  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents other in connection with the divestiture of our tire  vinyl and other businesses  we have received contractual rights of indemnification from third parties for environmental and other claims arising out of the divested businesses 
failure of these third parties to honor their indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
guarantees we have guaranteed amounts owed by coltec capital trust with respect to the million of outstanding tides and have guaranteed coltec s performance of its obligations with respect to the tides and the underlying coltec convertible subordinated debentures 
following the spin off of the eip segment  the tides remained outstanding as an obligation of coltec capital trust and our guarantee with respect to the tides remains an obligation of ours 
enpro  coltec and coltec capital trust have agreed to indemnify us for any costs and liabilities arising under or related to the tides after the spin off 
in addition to our guarantee of the tides  at december   we have an outstanding contingent liability for guarantees of debt and lease payments of million  letters of credit and bank guarantees of million  residual value of leases of million and executive loans to purchase our stock of million 
commercial airline customers several of our commercial airline customers are experiencing financial difficulties 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations on the financial condition of all of our customers and maintain reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon expected collectibility 
although we believe our reserves are adequate  we are not able to predict the future financial stability of these customers 
any material change in the financial status of any one or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the extent to which extended payment terms are granted to customers may negatively affect future cash flow 
tax in  coltec  our former subsidiary  made a million payment to the internal revenue service irs for an income tax assessment and the related accrued interest arising out of certain capital loss deductions and tax credits taken in on february   coltec filed suit against the us government in the us court of federal claims seeking a refund of this payment 
the trial portion of the case was completed in may on november   we were notified that the trial court ruled in favor of coltec and ordered the government to refund federal tax payments of million to coltec 
this tax refund will also bear interest to the date of payment 
as of december   the interest amount was approximately million before tax  or million after tax 
a final judgment was entered in this case by the us court of federal claims on february  the government has until april  to appeal the decision to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
if the government does not appeal the decision or the trial court judge s decision is ultimately upheld  we will be entitled to this tax refund and related interest pursuant to an agreement with coltec 
if we receive these amounts  we expect to record net income of approximately million  based on interest through december   and including the release of previously established reserves 
if the irs were to appeal the judgment and ultimately prevail in this case  coltec will not owe any additional interest or taxes with respect to we may  however  be required by the irs to pay up to million plus accrued interest with respect to the same items claimed by coltec in its tax returns for through the amount of 
table of contents the previously estimated tax liability if the irs were to prevail for the through period remains fully reserved 
in  the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency asserting that rohr  inc rohr  our subsidiary  was liable for million of additional income taxes for the fiscal years ended july  through in  the irs issued an additional statutory notice of deficiency asserting that rohr was liable for million of additional income taxes for the fiscal years ended july  through the proposed assessments relate primarily to the timing of certain tax deductions and tax credits 
rohr has filed petitions in the us tax court opposing the proposed assessments 
rohr expects that these cases may be scheduled for trial in and that it will ultimately be successful in these cases 
at the time of settlement or final determination by the court  there will be a net cash cost to us due at least in part to the reversal of a timing item 
we believe that our total net cash cost is unlikely to exceed million 
we are reserved for the estimated liability associated with these cases and as a result  we do not expect a charge to earnings to result from the resolution of these matters 
we are continuously undergoing examination by the irs  as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions 
the irs and other taxing authorities routinely challenge certain deductions and credits reported by us on our income tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  and sfas  accounting for contingencies  we establish reserves for tax contingencies that reflect our best estimate of the deductions and credits that we may be unable to sustain  or that we could be willing to concede as part of a broader tax settlement 
as of december   we have recorded tax contingency reserves of approximately million 
the current irs examination audit cycle began in march  and relates to the following consolidated income tax groups for the following years rohr  inc and subsidiaries july  december  through date of acquisition coltec industries inc and subsidiaries december  july  through date of acquisition goodrich corporation and subsidiaries including rohr and coltec there are numerous tax issues that have been raised during the examination by the irs  including  but not limited to  transfer pricing  research and development credits  foreign tax credits  tax accounting for long term contracts  tax accounting for inventory  tax accounting for stock options  depreciation  amortization and the proper timing for certain other deductions for income tax purposes 
one of our subsidiaries  rohr  inc rohr has been under examination by the state of california for the tax years ending july   and the state of california has disallowed certain expenses incurred by one of rohr s subsidiaries in connection with the lease of certain tangible property 
california s state board of equalization has held that the deductions associated with the leased equipment were non business deductions  resulting in an additional tax assessment of approximately million 
the amount of interest on the tax assessment is approximately million 
we continue to contest the assessment 
we are adequately reserved for this contingency 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter adoption of sfas is required by the year beginning january  we plan to adopt sfas no later than that date 
the amendments made by sfas clarify that 
table of contents abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
while sfas enhances arb and clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage  the statement also removes inconsistencies between arb and ias and amends arb to clarify that abnormal amounts of costs should be recognized as period costs 
under some circumstances  according to arb  the above listed costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires these items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion 
this statement will apply to our businesses if they become subject to abnormal costs as defined in sfas we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees sfas  and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas we adopted the sfas fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january  using the modified prospective method described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
currently  we use the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees 
sfas r requires that we use the valuation technique that best fits the circumstances 
we are currently evaluating other techniques 
sfas r requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  thus  reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in the periods after the effective date 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flow recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions for stock based compensation were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sfas r also requires that we estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest and to revise the estimate as the actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
the effect of these items and other changes in sfas r as well as the potential impact on our future consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet is currently being evaluated 
we will adopt sfas r no later than july  on december   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp and fsp 
fsp provides guidance on the application of sfas  accounting for income taxes  with regard to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provision within hr the american jobs creation act of act that was enacted on october  fsp provides guidance on a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to qualifying us taxpayers 
the act contains numerous provisions related to corporate and international taxation including repeal of the extraterritorial income eti regime  creation of a new domestic production activities dpa deduction and a temporary dividends received deduction related to repatriation of foreign earnings 
the act contains various effective dates and transition periods related to its provisions 
under the guidance provided in fsp the new dpa deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas as such  the special deduction has no effect on the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our 
table of contents income tax return 
the repeal of eti and its replacement with a dpa deduction were not in effect in and therefore  did not have an affect on our income tax provision for the year ended december  we do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti deduction and phase in of the new dpa deduction to result in a material impact on our effective income tax rate in in fsp  the financial accounting standards board acknowledged that  due to the proximity of the act s enactment date to many companies year ends and the fact that numerous provisions within the act are complex and pending further regulatory guidance  many companies may not be in a position to assess the impacts of the act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings 
therefore  the fsp provided companies with a practical exception to the permanent reinvestment standards of sfas and apb no 
by providing additional time to determine the amount of earnings  if any  that they intend to repatriate under the act s provisions 
we are not yet in a position to decide whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings to the us therefore  under the guidance provided in fsp  no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection with the repatriation provisions of the act 
we are currently analyzing the impact of the temporary dividends received deduction provisions contained in the act 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing obligations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  we recognize revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which typically is at the time of shipment 
revenues earned from providing maintenance service are recognized when the service is complete 
contract accounting percentage of completion revenue recognition included in contract costs  or estimated revenues  are the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
in the event that actual experience differs from estimates or facts and circumstances change  estimated costs or revenues will be revised 
effective january   we changed two aspects of the application of contract accounting for our aerostructures business unit  including a change to the cumulative catch up method from the reallocation method for accounting for changes in contract estimates of revenue and costs and a change to the accounting for certain pre certification costs 
pre certification costs  
table of contents including those in excess of original estimated levels  are now included in total contract costs used to evaluate overall contract profitability 
these contract accounting methods are described below 
the impact of these changes on our financial statements was income of approximately million after tax or million before tax  which was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting in the first quarter of we have sales under long term  fixed priced contracts  many of which contain escalation clauses  requiring delivery of products over several years and frequently providing the buyer with option pricing on follow on orders 
sales and profits on each contract are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  using the units of delivery method 
we follow the guidelines of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability are known 
profit is estimated based on the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract 
changes in estimated total revenue and estimated total cost are recognized as business or economic conditions change and the impact on contract profitability is recorded immediately in that period using the cumulative catch up method 
cost includes the estimated cost of the preproduction effort  primarily tooling and design  plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
the specified number of production units used to establish the profit margin is predicated upon contractual terms adjusted for market forecasts and does not exceed the lesser of those quantities assumed in original contract pricing as adjusted to the date of certification  or those quantities which we now expect to deliver in the timeframe period assumed in the original contract pricing or at the date of certification 
our policies only allow the estimated number of production units to be delivered to exceed the quantity assumed within the original contract pricing or at date of certification when we receive firm orders for additional units or we are required to begin manufacturing of units under contractual production lead time 
the assumed timeframe period is generally equal to the period specified in the contract 
if the contract is a life of program contract  then such period is equal to the time period used in the original pricing model adjusted  if appropriate  to the expected period of production estimated at the date of certification 
option quantities are combined with prior orders when follow on orders are released 
the contract method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events  including the quantity and timing of product deliveries 
also included are assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs 
these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements 
we re evaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflect changes in estimates immediately under the cumulative catch up method for the impact on shipments to date 
included in sales are amounts arising from contract terms that provide for invoicing a portion of the contract price at a date after delivery 
also included are negotiated values for units delivered and anticipated price adjustments for contract changes  claims  escalation and estimated earnings in excess of billing provisions  resulting from the percentage of completion method of accounting 
certain contract costs are estimated based on the learning curve concept discussed below 

table of contents inventory inventoried costs on long term contracts include certain preproduction costs  consisting primarily of tooling and design costs and production costs  including applicable overhead 
the costs attributed to units delivered under long term commercial contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average during the early years of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceeds the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to current earnings  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
income taxes in accordance with sfas  apb opinion no 
 and fin no 
 as of each reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions and estimates as to the amount and jurisdictional source of income expected to be earned during the full fiscal year 
further influencing this estimate are evolving interpretations of new and existing tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues our actual effective tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
in accordance with sfas  we record tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
as of december   we had recorded tax contingency reserves of approximately million 
in accordance with sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes are measured using enacted tax laws and rates 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
identifiable intangible assets identifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost  or when acquired as part of a business combination  at estimated fair value 
these assets include patents and other technology agreements  sourcing contracts  trademarks  licenses  customer relationships and non compete agreements 
intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of to years for all acquisitions completed on or prior to june  for acquisitions completed subsequent to june   identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their useful life using undiscounted cash flows  a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed 
impairments of identifiable intangible assets are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related groups of assets  may not be recoverable and our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining useful lives is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the determination of undiscounted cash flow is based on our segments plans 
the revenue growth is based upon aircraft build projections from aircraft manufacturers and widely available external publications 
the profit 
table of contents margin assumption is based upon the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
measurement of the amount of impairment may be based upon an appraisal  market values of similar assets or estimated discounted future cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
sales incentives we offer sales incentives to certain airline customers in connection with sales contracts 
these incentives may consist of up front cash payments  merchandise credits and or free products 
the cost of these incentives is recognized in the period incurred unless recovery of these costs is specifically guaranteed by the customer in the contract 
if the contract contains such a guarantee  then the cost of the sales incentive is capitalized as other assets and amortized as cost of sales over the contract period 
at december  and  the carrying amount of sales incentives was million and million  respectively 
entry fees investment in risk and revenue sharing programs certain businesses in our engine systems segment make cash payments  referred to as entry fees  to an original equipment manufacturer oem under long term contractual arrangements related to new engine programs 
in return  we receive a controlled access supply contract and a percentage of program revenue generated by the oem as part of these arrangements 
the program revenue generated by the oem may result from the sale of components produced by us or other program participants by selling original equipment or aftermarket products spares 
at the time of payment  the aircraft manufacturer has launched a new aircraft platform  critical suppliers have been selected and we have deemed our product to be technologically feasible 
although our product is technologically feasible  we do not have access to information on the technological feasibility of the products of the oem s other critical suppliers 
however  we are not aware of any program for which we have entered into a contract that has been cancelled prior to engine delivery due to the lack of technological feasibility of the engine 
in our agreement with the oem  there are no restrictions on the use of the entry fees by the oem  however  in the oem s annual report  it states that entry fees have enabled it to build a broad portfolio of engines  thereby reducing its exposure to individual product risk 
the oem also states that the primary financial benefit of entry fees to it is a reduction of its own funding of research and development on new programs 
we account for entry fees similar to an investment in future cash flows 
we begin to receive cash payments from the oem  at the latest  after aircraft certification  which typically occurs approximately four years after payment of the entry fee 
however  if the oem s customers place orders with the oem prior to that time  which frequently occurs  we will receive a percentage of any related deposits 
activities during the four year period following our initial payment of entry fees include continued refinement of the engine systems  certification of the engine systems  flight certification of the engine  flight certification of the aircraft and entry into service of the aircraft 
as with any investment  there are risks inherent in recovering the value of entry fees 
such risks are consistent with the risks associated in acquiring a revenue producing asset in which market conditions may change or the risks that arise when a manufacturer of a product on which a royalty is based has business difficulties and cannot produce the product 
such risks include but are not limited to the following changes in market conditions that may affect product sales under the program  including market acceptance and competition from others  
table of contents performance of subcontract suppliers and other production risks  bankruptcy or other less significant financial difficulties of other program participants  including the aircraft manufacturer  the oem and other program suppliers or the aircraft customer  and availability of specialized raw materials in the marketplace 
entry fees are recorded as other assets and are amortized on a straight line basis to cost of sales over the program s estimated useful life following aircraft certification  which typically approximates years 
the net carrying amount of entry fees was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the carrying amount of entry fees is evaluated for impairment at least annually or when other indicators of impairment exist 
impairment is assessed based on the expected undiscounted cash flow from the program over the remaining program life as compared to the recorded amount of entry fees 
if impairment exists  a charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount of the entry fee exceeds its fair value 
no such impairment charges were recorded in the years ended december   or pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated by us in consultation with an outside actuary 
changes in assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase and the long term rate of return on plan assets are based upon our historical and benchmark data 
health care cost projections are evaluated annually 
the discount rate is evaluated at december  using the appropriate index eg  moody s aa long term high quality bond rate for the us plans and iboxx aa long term high quality bond rate for the uk plans 
the appropriate assumptions are used for the applicable country 
following is a summary of our assumptions for determining the pension and postretirement benefits other than pension obligations and the annual cost for weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations as of december  other us plans us plans us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension benefit costs for the year ended december  other us plans us plans us plans discount rate expected long term return on assets rate of compensation increase the weighted average discount rate assumption used to determine postretirement benefits other than pension obligations at december  was percent 
also  for measurement purposes  a percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to percent for and remain at that level thereafter 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used to determine net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended december  was percent 

table of contents sensitivity analysis the table below quantifies the approximate impact of a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension plan cost and liability holding all other assumptions constant 
the discount rate assumption is selected each year based on market conditions in effect as of the disclosure date 
the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the disclosure date and for calculating the following year s pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption  although reviewed each year  is changed less frequently due to the long term nature of the assumption 
this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of disclosure date  rather  it is used only in the calculation of pension expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
refer to note q derivatives and hedging activities in part item of this form k for a description of current developments involving our hedging activities 

table of contents interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our outstanding variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in addition to those financial instruments  we had million outstanding at year end under our variable rate receivables securitization program 
at december   a hypothetical basis point unfavorable change in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in july  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in in october  we entered into two million fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
one million swap is on our percent senior notes due in and the other million swap is on our percent medium term notes due in in december  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in the purpose of the interest rates swaps was to increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
the settlement and maturity dates on the swaps are the same as those on the related notes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the carrying values of the notes have been adjusted to reflect the fair values of the related interest rate swaps 
the table represents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates excluding the receivables securitization program 
also included is information about our interest rate swaps 
expected maturity dates fair debt thereafter total value dollars in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate capital lease obligations interest rate swaps fixed to variable notional value loss average pay rate average receive rate foreign currency exposure we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency and translation of income and expense and balance sheet amounts of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to transaction and income risks through our normal operating activities and  where appropriate  through foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange negatively impacted the financial results in our business segments in approximately percent of our revenues and approximately percent of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over percent of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
we do hedge a portion of our 
table of contents exposure on an ongoing basis 
when the us dollar weakens  our unhedged net costs rise in us dollar terms 
with a weakening us dollar trend  our average hedge rates also become less favorable and thus have a negative impact on net income 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of income of international businesses into us dollars will affect comparability of revenues and expenses between years 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell us dollars for great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars  euros and polish zlotys 
these forward contracts are used to mitigate a portion of the potential volatility to cash flows arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we had forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy canadian dollars  forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy euros and forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy polish zlotys 
these forward contracts mature on a monthly basis with maturity dates that range from january to april at december   a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies would decrease the value of the forward contracts described above by million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was million at december  because we hedge only a portion of our exposure  a strengthening of the us dollar as described above would have a more than offsetting benefit to our financial results in future periods 
in addition to the foreign exchange cash flow hedges  we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
as of december   we had forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy great britain pounds  contracts with a net notional value of million to buy euros and contracts with a notional value of million to sell canadian dollars
