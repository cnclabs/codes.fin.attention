the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
executive overview amreit amex amy is an internally advised  self managed equity real estate investment trust reit with a year history of delivering results to our investors 
based in houston  amreit manages  acquires and develops irreplaceable corners which we define as premier retail frontage properties typically located on main and main intersections in high traffic  highly populated affluent areas 
our portfolio consists of shopping centers anchored by market dominant tenants such as kroger  barnes noble and walgreens and are supported by specialty retailers such as gap  starbucks  hallmark and verizon wireless 
our business structure drives our growth and consists of a publicly traded reit that is supported by three synergistic businesses a wholly owned real estate operating and development business  an nasd registered broker dealer securities business and a merchant development retail partnership business 
this flexible structure allows amreit access to multiple avenues of low cost capital which can be deployed efficiently and accretively for our shareholders 
in addition  our business structure cultivates growth both internally and externally  distinguishing amreit as a value creator  a growth company and a source of dependable monthly income 
amreit s goal is to deliver dependable  monthly income for our shareholders 
in so doing  amreit strives to increase and maximize funds from operations ffo per share by issuing long term capital through both the nasd independent financial planning marketplace and potentially through underwritten offerings  and investing the capital in accretive real estate properties  acquired or developed  on irreplaceable corners 
additionally  we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by keeping a debt to gross asset value ratio of less than 
as of december   our ratio of debt to gross asset value was less than 
at december   amreit directly owned a portfolio of properties located in states  subject to long term leases with retail tenants 
in addition  amreit owns partial interests in properties through joint ventures or partnerships 
eleven of our properties are multi tenant shopping centers and comprised of our annualized rental income from properties owned as of december  fifty of the properties are single tenant properties and comprised approximately of our annualized rental income from properties owned as of december  in assessing the performance of the company s properties  management evaluates the occupancy of the company s portfolio 
occupancy for our operating properties was as of december  as compared to as of december  we have been developing and acquiring multi tenant shopping centers for almost ten years in our retail partnership business 
during that time  we believe we have sharpened our ability to recognize the high end grocery anchored  strip center  lifestyle center and single tenant properties that can create long term value 
with the downward pressure on single tenant cap rates  resulting in higher priced real estate  management anticipates strategically increasing its holdings of multi tenant shopping centers 
management expects to increase total assets from million as of december  to approximately million by mid through its class c and d common 
table of contents share offerings  the company raised approximately million in capital in  which along with debt financing  financed million in property acquisitions and developments in in order to continue to expand and develop its portfolio of properties and other investments  the company intends to finance future acquisitions and growth through the most advantageous sources of capital available at the time 
such capital sources may include proceeds from public or private offerings of the company s debt or equity securities  secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders  acquisitions of the company s affiliated entities or other unrelated companies  or the disposition of assets  as well as undistributed funds from operations 
management expects that single tenant  credit leased properties  will continue to experience cap rate pressure during due to the low interest rate environment and increased buyer demand 
therefore  we will continue to divest of properties which no longer meet our core criteria  and replace them with high quality grocery anchored  lifestyle and multi tenant shopping centers or the development of single tenant properties located on irreplaceable corners 
with respect to additional growth opportunities  we currently have over million of projects in our pipeline at various stages of evaluation 
each potential acquisition is subjected to a rigorous due diligence process that includes site inspections  financial underwriting  credit analysis and market and demographic studies 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any or all of these projects will ultimately be purchased by amreit 
management has budgeted for an increase in interest rates during as of december   approximately of our outstanding debt had a long term fixed interest rate with an average term of seven years 
our philosophy continues to be matching long term leases with long term debt structures while keeping our debt to total assets ratio less than 
summary of critical accounting policies the results of operations and financial condition of the company  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors  which could affect the ongoing viability of the company s tenants 
management believes the most critical accounting policies in this regard are revenue recognition  the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired  the allowance for doubtful accounts and accounting for real estate acquisitions 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the circumstances 
revenue recognition the company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms 
the majority of the leases are accounted for under the operating method with revenue being recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the individual leases 
accrued rents are included in tenant receivables 
revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes  maintenance expenses and insurance is recognized in the period the related expense is recorded 
additionally  certain of the lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants sales volumes contingent or percentage rent 
percentage rents are earned when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements and are generally recognized when such rents are collected 
the terms of certain leases require that the building improvement portion of the lease be accounted for under the direct financing method 
such method requires that an asset be recorded for the present value of such future cash flows and that a portion of such cash flows be recognized as earned income over the life of the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return 
the company has been engaged to provide various services  including development  construction management  property management  leasing and brokerage 
the fees for these services are generally calculated as a percentage of revenues earned or to be earned and of property cost  as appropriate 
such fees are recognized as services are provided 
real estate valuation land  buildings and improvements are recorded at cost 
expenditures related to the development of real estate are carried at cost which includes capitalized carrying charges  acquisition costs and development costs 
carrying charges  primarily interest and loan acquisition costs  and direct and indirect development costs related to buildings under construction are capitalized as part of construction in progress 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the date of completion of major 
table of contents construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
the company capitalizes acquisition costs once the acquisition of the property becomes probable 
prior to that time  the company expenses these costs as acquisition expenses 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of up to years for buildings  up to years for site improvements and over the term of lease for tenant improvements 
leasehold estate properties  where the company owns the building and improvements but not the related ground  are amortized over the life of the lease 
management reviews its properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets  including accrued rental income  may not be recoverable through operations 
management determines whether an impairment in value occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  including the residual value of the property  with the carrying value of the individual property 
if impairment is indicated  a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
valuation of receivables an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents  property receivables and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical payment history  tenant credit worthiness  additional guarantees and other economic trends 
balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributed to the accrual of straight line rents 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy are considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables 
real estate acquisitions we account for real estate acquisitions pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas accordingly  we allocate the purchase price of the acquired properties to land  building and improvements  identifiable intangible assets and to the acquired liabilities based on their respective fair values 
identifiable intangibles include amounts allocated to acquired out of market leases and to the value of in place leases 
we determine fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  tenant demand and other economic conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
intangibles related to out of market leases and in place lease value are recorded as acquired lease intangibles and are amortized over the remaining terms of the underlying leases 
premiums or discounts on acquired out of market debt are amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of such debt 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the three years ended december are as follows in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities and financing activities have been the principal sources of capital to fund the company s ongoing operations and dividends 
as amreit deploys the capital raised  and expected to be raised  from its equity offerings into income producing real estate  we anticipate that cash flow from operations will provide adequate resources for future ongoing operations and dividends 
amreit s cash on hand  internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  issuance of equity 
table of contents securities  as well as the placement of secured debt and other equity alternatives  are expected to provide the necessary capital to maintain and operate our properties as well as execute our growth strategies 
additionally  as part of its investment strategy  amreit constantly evaluates its property portfolio  systematically selling off any non core or underperforming assets  and replacing them with irreplaceable corners tm and other core assets 
as we continue to raise capital  we anticipate growing and increasing our operating cash flow by selling the underperforming assets and deploying the capital generated into high quality income producing retail real estate assets 
during  this was evidenced through the purchases of courtyard at post oak  a thousand square foot community shopping center  plaza in the park  a thousand square foot grocery anchored shopping center  cinco ranch plaza  a thousand square foot grocery anchored shopping center  bakery square  a thousand square foot community shopping center and macarthur park  a thousand square foot grocery anchored shopping center 
management determined during the fourth quarter of that the company would begin marketing the vacant just for feet property located in baton rouge  la 
as a result  an impairment on such property was recorded in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of  and the property has been reflected as held for sale as of december  in june  amreit began marketing its class d common share offering  a million publicly registered  non traded common share offering  offered through the independent financial planning community 
the class d common shares have a stated  non preferred annual dividend  paid monthly  are eligible for conversion into the company s class a common shares at any time after a seven year lock out period for a premium on invested capital and are callable by the company after one year 
the company will utilize the proceeds from the sale of the class d shares primarily to pay down debt or acquire additional properties 
at december   the company had raised approximately million through the sale of the class d common shares  including shares issued through the dividend reinvestment program 
cash provided by operating activities as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by a couple of factors 
our income before the effect of depreciation and amortization  impairment and merger costs increased by million in compared to such increase was driven by the significant multi tenant property acquisitions made during additionally  during  we invested million less than in in real estate acquired for resale and generated an additional thousand in proceeds from sale of such properties during compared to our investments in real estate acquired for resale have historically been in single tenant properties  and we reduced our single tenant acquisition activity during due to the continued compression of single tenant cap rates 
cash flows used in investing activities as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased from million in to million in cash flows used in investing activities has been primarily related to our increased multi tenant retail property acquisition activity during as described above 
these investments were funded through a combination of capital raised through both the class c and d common share offerings and debt financing  including the assumption of existing debt on certain acquisitions 
these investing outflows were partially offset by the collection during of a million note receivable funded during as well as an increase of million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during versus for the year ended december  amreit sold two single tenant non core properties held for investment resulting in cash proceeds of million versus proceeds of million during from the sale of two single tenant properties held for investment 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased from million during to million during cash flows provided by financing activities were primarily generated by asc through our class c and d common share offerings 
net proceeds generated from asc s capital raising activities increased during by million over proceeds 
the full amount of these net proceeds was used to purchase irreplaceable corners or to pay down debt 
this increase in net offering proceeds was partially offset by a million increase in dividends paid to a  b  c and d shareholders 
this dividend increase was a result of an increase in the class a share dividends as well as the issuance of additional shares during amreit has begun to market its class d common share offering  a million common share offering  offered through the 
table of contents independent financial planning community  and through december  has raised approximately million  including shares issued through the dividend reinvestment program 
one advantage of raising capital through the independent financial planning marketplace is the capital is received on a daily basis  allowing for a scaleable matching of real estate projects 
our first priority is to deploy the capital raised  and then to moderately leverage the capital  while maintaining our philosophy of a conservative balance sheet 
the company has an unsecured credit facility the credit facility in place which is being used to provide funds for the acquisition of properties and working capital 
the credit facility matures in october and provides that the company may borrow up to million subject to the value of unencumbered assets 
in october  the company renewed its credit facility on terms and conditions substantially the same as the previous facility 
the credit facility contains covenants which  among other restrictions  require the company to maintain a minimum net worth  a maximum leverage ratio  maximum tenant concentration ratios  specified interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and allow the lender to approve all distributions 
at december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants 
the credit facility s annual interest rate varies depending upon the company s debt to asset ratio  from libor plus a spread of to libor plus a spread of 
as of december   the interest rate was libor plus 
as of december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the company has approximately million available under its line of credit  subject to lender approval on the use of the proceeds 
in addition to the credit facility  amreit utilizes various permanent mortgage financing and other debt instruments 
contractual obligations as of december   the company had the following contractual debt obligations see also note the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the specific terms of our debt thereafter total unsecured debt revolving credit facility dissenter notes secured debt interest non cancelable operating lease payments total contractual obligations interest expense includes our interest obligations on our revolving credit facility as well as on our fixed rate loans 
our revolving credit facility is a variable rate debt instrument  and its outstanding balance fluctuates throughout the year based on our liquidity needs 
this table assumes that the balance outstanding million and the interest rate as of december  remain constant throughout all periods presented 
secured debt as shown above is million less than total secured debt as reported due to the premium recorded on above market debt assumed in conjunction with certain of our property acquisitions 

table of contents during  the company paid dividends to its shareholders of million  compared with million in the class a  c and d shareholders receive monthly dividends and the class b shareholders receive quarterly dividends 
all dividends are declared on a quarterly basis 
the dividends by class follows in thousands class a class b class c class d fourth quarter third quarter second quarter n a first quarter n a fourth quarter n a third quarter n a second quarter n a n a first quarter n a n a until properties are acquired by the company  the company s funds are used to pay down outstanding debt under the credit facility 
this investment strategy allows us to manage our interest costs and provides us with the liquidity to acquire properties at such time as those suitable for acquisition are located 
inflation has had very little effect on income from operations 
management expects that increases in store sales volumes due to inflation as well as increases in the consumer price index  may contribute to capital appreciation of the company properties 
these factors  however  also may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the tenants of the properties 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million or in as compared to million in versus million in 
rental revenues increased by million or in as compared to of this increase  million is related to rental revenues from properties that we acquired during the year 
in addition  million of the increase in rental revenues is related to a full year of rental revenue recorded during from the properties that were acquired in additionally  portfolio occupancy at december  was  which is an increase compared to occupancy of 
securities commission income increased by million or in as compared to this increase in securities commission income is due to increased capital being raised through our broker dealer company  amreit securities company asc 
as asc raises capital for either amreit or its affiliated retail partnerships  asc earns a securities commission of between and of the money raised

expenses general operating and administrative expense increased by million  or  during to million compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increases in personnel necessitated by the growth in the portfolio as well as an increase in property costs

by building our various teams  we have not only been able to grow revenue and funds from operations  but believe that we will be able to sustain and further enhance our growth

funds from operations amreit considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the operating performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  nareit recommends that extraordinary items not be considered in arriving at ffo 
amreit calculates its ffo in accordance with this definition 
most industry analysts and equity reits  including amreit  consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation  ffo is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods  or as compared to different companies 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by amreit is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 

table of contents below is the calculation of ffo and the reconciliation to net income  which the company believes is the most comparable gaap financial measure to ffo  in thousands income loss before discontinued operations loss income from discontinued operations plus depreciation of real estate assets from operations plus depreciation of real estate assets from discontinued operations less gain loss on sale of real estate assets acquired for investment less class b  c d distributions total funds from operations available to class a shareholders cash dividends paid to class a shareholders dividends in excess of ffo based on adherence to the nareit definition of ffo  we have not added back the million  thousand or million charge to earnings during  and  respectively  resulting from shares issued to mr 
taylor as the deferred merger consideration 
additionally  we have not added back the million charge to earnings for the year ended december   resulting from two asset impairments and corresponding write downs of value 
adding these charges back to earnings would result in million  million and million adjusted funds from operations available to class a shareholders  respectively and in adjusted ffo in excess of dividends available to class a shareholders of thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line of credit and related to the refinancing of long term debt which currently contains fixed interest rates 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps or any other derivative financial instruments as part of our interest rate risk management approach 
at december   approximately million of our total debt obligations have fixed rate terms and have an estimated fair value of million 
approximately million of our total debt obligations have variable rate terms  and the carrying value of such debt is therefore representative of its fair value as of december  in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  annual net income  funds from operations and future cash flows would decrease by thousand based upon the variable rate debt outstanding at december
