item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview dow jones company is a provider of global business and financial news and information through newspapers  newswires  magazines  the internet  indexes  television and radio 
in addition  the company owns general interest community newspapers throughout the us over the three years ended in december  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from the print publishing segment  which is largely comprised of the global editions of the wall street journal 
the company s overall financial results are largely dependent on the operating performance of the wall street journal  which  to a significant extent  is dependent upon business to business bb advertising placed in its publications  particularly from the financial and technology sectors 
the remaining of total revenues are split almost equally between our general interest community newspapers segment and our electronic publishing segment  which includes newswires  wsj online  indexes and other electronic operations 
we began to see a modest recovery in the global bb advertising environment beginning in the third quarter which carried into the first two quarters of this advertising recovery stalled in the last half of and remains choppy in part due to continued weakness in bb technology advertising and volatile financial advertising 
for the full year  advertising linage at the wall street journal declined  which resulted in a increase in ad revenue at print publishing as the lower volume was more than offset by higher advertising rates 
we posted gains in revenue  operating profits and margins in driven by improvements at all of our business segments 
in addition  we are continuing to control costs  improve the quality of our products  sharpen our execution and invest in initiatives to fuel our future growth 
these future growth initiatives include our planned launch in september of the weekend edition of the journal and our january acquisition of marketwatch  both of which we believe will help reduce our reliance over time on bb financial and technology advertising 
in september  we announced the september launch of the weekend edition of the journal  which will be a key element of our to strategic plan 
we expect the launch of the weekend edition will build off the success of our weekend journal and personal journal sections in growing and diversifying our advertising customer base by attracting more consumer oriented advertisers as revenue from the weekend edition is expected to mainly come from consumer advertising 
we have a uniquely influential and affluent audience that not only makes large bb spending decisions but also spends heavily on personal consumption items 
the weekend edition will enable advertisers to reach these readers in the right place at the right time at home on the weekend which is highly conducive to influencing their consumer spending decisions 
while it is expected that this initiative will be dilutive to earnings by about cents per share in and more than that in based on its first full year of operation  we believe that the weekend edition will be a major driver of long term growth in revenue and earnings 
on january   we completed the acquisition of marketwatch  inc marketwatch for a purchase price of approximately million  including direct transaction costs 
marketwatch is a leading provider of business news  financial information and analytical tools and operates two award winning web sites marketwatch 
com and bigcharts 
com 
these free  advertising supported sites serve approximately seven million unique visitors per month with timely market news and information 
marketwatch also operates the marketwatch information services group  which is a leading licensor of market news  data  investment analysis tools and other online applications to financial services firms  media companies  and corporations 
the company intends to integrate marketwatch into the consumer electronic publishing business 
the company believes that the marketwatch merger will complement the wall street journal online network  which provides premium business news to about three million unique visitors per month 
by combining the traffic of the wall street journal network of sites and marketwatch  the web sites are expected to have close to nine million unduplicated unique visitors per month 
we expect this acquisition will be dilutive to earnings by five cents per share in  reflecting higher interest and amortization costs and then accretive in our first full year of ownership in  when our integration benefits are expected to take full effect 
marked the final year of business now  our three year strategic plan  which was launched in and aimed at accelerating growth and modestly reducing cyclicality by improving operational execution and enhancing existing products and creating new ones to reach new customers  markets and channels 
the cornerstone of business now was today s journal  a package of content  organization and design changes to the wall street journal that also included a new personal journal section 
launched in april  today s journal also increased total page capacity by and tripled color page capacity to pages a day 
today s journal has produced strong positive reader and advertiser response 
the expanded color advertising capacity  which sells at a premium to black and white advertising  drove a increase in color advertising pages in  to approximately eight pages per day 
since the launch of this new color capacity in january  color advertising pages more than doubled 
we also successfully used today s journal to increase our consumer advertising to help reduce our reliance on bb advertising 
advertising revenue in our targeted consumer categories of auto  travel  health care and luxury goods was up in and since 
table of contents the company s electronic publishing segment implemented a number of business now initiatives to improve its products  profits and margins as well as reduce overall company reliance on bb advertising 
on march   the company acquired alternative investor group for million 
alternative investor has been integrated with our newsletters operations and the recently acquired technologic partners business 
this newly formed business provides newsletters  databases and conferences primarily to the venture capital and private equity markets 
on april   the company acquired vwd  a german newswires business  for a net price of million  expanding on dow jones newswires local language newswire businesses 
both of these businesses will be operated as part of dow jones newswires within our electronic publishing segment 
in electronic publishing we have also driven significant organic growth in revenue and earnings at our consumer electronic publishing and dow jones indexes businesses 
our ottaway community newspapers segment serves relatively small  self contained communities  outside the heavy competitive pressures of large metropolitan papers and other media 
ottaway s strong and stable cash flow over the years has helped us weather a particularly harsh bb ad environment in our print publishing segment 
as part of our business now three year plan to enhance our ottaway property portfolio  we divested five low growth papers in  which provided after tax proceeds of million and utilized million of capital loss carryforwards 
the second phase of this plan was to acquire more strategic and financially attractive properties  which included the acquisitions in of the record of stockton  california and smaller papers in late finally  we continue to improve the quality and breadth of our products and services 
in  we have won a number of awards including two pulitzer prizes and a number of loeb awards for the journal 
for the second year in a row  dow jones newswires was named inside market data s news provider of the year and won its first ever codie award and the online journal won two codie awards

f contract guarantee in  the company completed the sale of its former subsidiary  telerate  to bridge information systems  inc bridge 
under the terms of the sale  dow jones retained its guarantee of payments under certain circumstances of certain annual minimum payments for data acquired by telerate from cantor fitzgerald securities cantor and market data corporation mdc under contracts entered into during the period when telerate was a subsidiary of dow jones contract guarantee 
the annual minimum payments average approximately million per year through october under certain conditions 
bridge agreed to indemnify dow jones for any liability dow jones incurred under the contract guarantee with respect to periods subsequent to bridge s purchase of telerate 
however  bridge filed for bankruptcy protection on february   after unsuccessful attempts to reorganize its operations and arrange for additional financing 
dow jones believes that cantor and mdc have the obligation to cover  mitigate or otherwise reduce and or avoid any losses or damages under these circumstances  including by securing the best possible commercial terms for the supply of the subject data to a third party or parties 
cantor and mdc deny that they have this obligation 
dow jones believes that any and all amounts which are received by cantor and or mdc in respect of such data would reduce any liability that dow jones might have under the contract guarantee 
as of december   there was a high degree of uncertainty  however  as to what value the data might have in the marketplace  whether an agreement would be reached by cantor and or mdc to supply the data to a third party or parties  the financial position of such party or parties  the timing of any such agreement  and various related factors 
therefore  it was not possible for dow jones to determine with any certainty that any such offsets would in fact be realized  or at what time or in what amounts

on november   the company instituted a lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york against mdc and cantor seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the company s obligations  if any  under the guarantee 
in this lawsuit the company has asked the court to find that the company does not and will not owe any payment under the contract guarantee through october in the alternative  the company has asked the court to find that if any amount is owed  it must be reduced by amounts that cantor and mdc receive or should have received from other distribution of the data

as previously disclosed in  the company established a reserve for the present value of the total estimated payments through october in connection with dow jones guarantee of certain minimum payments for data acquired by dow jones former telerate subsidiary from cantor fitzgerald securities cantor and market data corporation mdc 
bridge information systems  inc  which purchased telerate in  is currently in bankruptcy but made payments for this data for the post petition periods through october  when telerate ceased operations  went out of business  sold certain assets and rejected its contracts with cantor and mdc

the company has various substantial defenses to these claims and the litigation is proceeding 

table of contents as of december   the balance of the reserve for the contract guarantee was million 
the company has classified million of this reserve as current based on the original due dates of the contract 
due to the stage of the lawsuit at december   it is not possible to determine whether the court will find that any obligation under the guarantee may be dismissed or reduced 
accordingly  the company believes the balance of the reserve continues to be appropriate 
subsequent event on january   the company completed its acquisition of marketwatch  inc marketwatch for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs 
this represents a purchase price of per diluted common share and was financed by million of commercial paper borrowings  with the balance funded in cash by the company  including cash received from marketwatch 
the commercial paper borrowings  which were refinanced in part with the proceeds of a million three year bond offering that occurred during the first quarter of  are supported by a million day revolving credit facility dated january  and million of multi year revolving credit facilities 
in  the company expects its beginning cash balance and cash provided by operations to be sufficient to meet its normal recurring operating commitments  fund capital expenditures of about million and pay dividends 
after funding capital expenditures and dividends  the company anticipates generating about million of excess cash flow from operations  which it expects will be used to reduce its higher debt level as a result of the marketwatch acquisition 
as previously disclosed  a trial date for the cantor contract guarantee legal proceeding is set to begin in mid in the event there is an adverse judgment against the company it would likely be appealed 
if any significant amounts are ultimately considered due  they would likely be financed through issuance of additional debt 
in addition to the bond offering mentioned above  if necessary  the company s liquidity requirements may be funded through the issuance of commercial paper  bank loans or long term notes under a million shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition to the day credit facility for million that expires on march   the company can borrow up to million under its multi year credit facilities  million through june   and million through june  the company s borrowing capacity is limited by certain debt covenants  based on cash flow measures 
as of year end  the company s indebtedness was approximately million less than the maximum borrowing allowed under the debt covenants 
total debt outstanding at december   which was in the form of commercial paper  was million  of which million was classified as long term  as it was the company s intent to refinance this obligation on a long term basis

market risk in december  the company entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to exchange us million for million british pounds and us million for million euro 
these contracts  which expire ratably over  are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated operating expenses that are denominated in these foreign currencies 
revenues of the company are largely collected in us dollars 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that operating expenses will be adversely affected by devaluation in the us dollar relative to these currencies 
realized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently through income and generally offset the transaction losses or gains on the foreign currency cash flows which they are intended to hedge 
the company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to limit the cash flow and earnings volatility that results from remeasuring certain foreign currency payables at prevailing exchange rates 
the unrealized gains or losses of these forward contracts are recognized in other  net in the income statement 
the forward contract acts as an economic hedge by increasing in value when the underlying foreign currency payable decreases in value and conversely decreases in value when the underlying foreign currency payable increases

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare act which supersedes fsp issued in january with the same title fsp 
fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the medicare act and is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the medicare act became law in december and introduced both a medicare prescription drug benefit and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
the company determined that its retiree health care plans provide a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company remeasured its postretirement obligation as of january  factoring in this expected benefit from medicare as a result of the adoption of fsp the remeasurement resulted in a reduction of the company s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and reduced its annual postretirement expense by million a reduction of service cost by million  interest cost by million and recognized actuarial loss by million

in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
this statement eliminates the alternative to apply the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion no 
 to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  fas r requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized in the consolidated statement of income over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
there are various methods of adopting r and the company has not yet determined which method it will use 
fas r will be effective for the company beginning july  in the fourth quarter of  the company  with approval from its board of directors  announced the acceleration of million stock options  representing all unvested options granted and outstanding after the company s decision to accelerate the vesting of certain outstanding stock option grants was made as part of a broad review of long term incentive compensation in light of changes in market practices and upcoming accounting changes 
other changes to be implemented beyond accelerating the vesting of certain options include reducing overall equity grant levels  a change in the mix of grants  and applying a three year cliff vesting schedule to future grants of stock options 
all in  the effect of these changes  combined with an expected july stock option expensing implementation date  is expected to result in a million increase in expense to the company in critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following are significant accounting policies of the company advertising revenue  net of commissions  is recognized in the period in which the advertisement is displayed 
the company s advertising rate card reflects certain volume based discounts  which require management to make certain estimates regarding future advertising volume 
these estimated rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the advertisement is displayed and are revised as necessary based on actual volume realized 
online related advertising revenue based on a minimum number of impressions is recognized as impressions occur 

table of contents revenue recognition from subscriptions to the company s print publications and information services is recognized in income as earned  pro rata on a per issue basis  over the subscription period 
circulation revenue includes sales to retail outlets newsstands  which are subject to returns 
the company records these retail sales upon delivery  net of estimated returns 
these estimated returns are based on historical return rates and are revised as necessary based on actual returns experienced 
costs in connection with the procurement of subscriptions are charged to expense as incurred 
revenue from licensing the dow jones averages includes both upfront one time fees and ongoing revenue 
both upfront fees and ongoing licensing revenue are recognized in income as earned over the license period 
accounts receivable includes an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is an estimate of amounts that may not be collectible 
this estimated allowance is based on historical trends  review of aging categories and the specific identification of certain customers that are at risk of not paying 
actual write offs of bad debt have historically been insignificant  less than of revenues 
certain costs and related obligations of the company are based on actuarial assumptions  including some of its pension plans and the cost of the company s postretirement medical plan  which provides lifetime health care benefits to retirees who meet specified length of service and age requirements 
these benefit costs are expensed over the employee s expected employment period 
at december   the company s postretirement retiree medical benefit obligation was million  which is not funded as it is the company s policy to fund postretirement medical costs as claims are incurred 
in determining the cost of retiree medical costs  some factors that management must consider include the expected increase in health care costs  discount rates and turnover and mortality rates 
the discount rate is based on the yield of long term corporate bonds at december  while other assumptions are updated periodically based on recent actual trends 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the cost for by million 
conversely  a one percentage point decline in assumed health care cost trend rates would have lowered the benefit obligation at the end of by million and the cost for by million 
a one quarter of one percentage point decrease in the company s expected discount rate in would have increased retiree medical expense by approximately million 
the majority of the company s employees who meet specific length of service requirements are covered by defined contribution retirement plans 
substantially all employees who are not covered by these plans are covered by defined benefit pension plans based on length of service and age requirements 
at december   the company s accumulated pension benefit obligation was million  of which million was funded 
in determining the cost and obligation of the defined pension benefit plans  management must consider such factors as the expected return on plan assets  discount rates and expected employee salary increases 
while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or changes in these assumptions would affect the calculation of its projected obligation and cost under the defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans 
the company evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually 
a one quarter of one percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on the company s plan assets in would have increased pension expense by approximately million 
management must use its judgment in assessing whether the carrying value of certain long lived assets  cost method investments  identifiable intangibles and goodwill is impaired and if any asset is impaired  the extent of any such loss 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and require an impairment review 
based on that review  if the carrying value of these assets exceeds fair value and is determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss representing the amount of excess over its fair value would be recognized in income 
fair value estimates are based on quoted market values in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
management also exercises judgment in determining the estimated useful life of long lived assets  specifically plant  property and equipment and certain intangible assets with a finite life 
the company depreciates the cost of buildings over years  improvements to the buildings over years  software over to years and machinery and equipment over to years 
the year life is applicable to the company s press equipment 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases 
management bases its judgment on estimated lives of these assets based on actual experienced length of service of similar assets and expert opinions 
the company also obtains third party appraisals to assist in determining whether an intangible asset has an indefinite life 

table of contents the company maintains a stock incentive plan under the dow jones long term incentive plan 
this plan provides for the grant of contingent stock rights  stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and other stock based awards 
the company accounts for its stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and its related interpretations 
under apb  pretax stock based compensation charged to income principally in relation to the company s contingent stock rights  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards was million in  million in and million in had the company s stock based compensation been determined by the fair value based method of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  the company s earnings per share for  and would have been reduced by roughly

management must exercise judgment in assessing the likely outcome of contingencies including those relating to tax matters  legal proceedings and other matters that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and those described in note to the financial statements 
both the timing and amount of the provisions made in the financial statements and related disclosures represent management s judgment of likelihood  based on information available at the time and on the advice of legal counsel 
provisions made in the financial statements represent management s judgment of likelihood based on information available at the time 
judicial or governmental bodies largely determine the outcome of these matters 
with regard to tax matters  the ultimate resolution of these matters  either by determinations by these bodies or other means  could be materially different from that assumed by the company in making its provisions and related disclosures 
at the time that these tax contingencies are resolved by tax examination or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the company adjusts its tax accounts accordingly 
the company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to its capital loss carryforward 
the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections 
the forward looking statements are based upon management s current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance  and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
by their nature  forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to risks relating to our business advertising revenues we derive a majority of our revenue from advertising  primarily in connection with our print publications and our online network of web sites 
our overall performance is largely dependent on the operating performance of the global wall street journal including its extended online and television brand and content  which  to a significant extent  is dependent upon business to business bb advertising generated by the distinctive demographic profile of the wall street journal s audience 

table of contents our advertising revenues are negatively impacted by economic downturns in any of our advertising markets  but particularly by downturns in our core market  bb advertising 
we have recently experienced depressed levels of advertising in the bb market  and bb advertising buyers continue to make spending decisions increasingly closer to publication dates  generally on a month to month basis 
our bb advertising levels  particularly in technology and finance  which have typically represented approximately of the wall street journal s advertising linage  may or may not return to historical levels 
we have experienced decreases in technology advertising  particularly computer software and communications advertising  which we believe may be a result of reduced corporate information technology spending and generally reduced levels of technology company profits and share prices 
we have also experienced decreases in financial advertising  including weakness in retail financial advertising  which we believe may be due to retail financial institutions focusing on reaching more mass consumer audiences through advertisements in publications that target these audiences  and a decline in tombstone ads  which we believe may be a result of reduced deal activity and changing advertising practices 
although we have taken initiatives including the introduction of our personal journal section of the wall street journal and our new weekend edition  which will be a weekend publication of the wall street journal beginning in september to attract more consumer advertising and other diversified advertising  we may or may not be able to further penetrate these new consumer advertising segments 
in particular  the wall street journal s broad national circulation limits our ability to provide certain local advertising to consumers  which advertising is featured in the regional publications of some of our competitors 
furthermore  our new weekend edition may fail to generate anticipated advertising revenues  resulting in greater losses than are currently expected in its first two years of operation 
in addition  the new weekend edition may draw advertising away from our other consumer advertising sections  such as the weekend journal section of the wall street journal introduced in and personal journal  for consumer advertising revenues 
our community newspapers rely on advertising revenue from local advertisers 
these revenues may be negatively impacted by the condition of the economy in the areas where our community newspapers are circulated and by the advertising habits of large regional advertisers who may change their spending patterns or go out of business 
circulation revenues circulation revenues from our publications  in particular the wall street journal  are another significant source of revenue for us 
our circulation revenue may be impacted by competition from other publications and other forms of media 
in addition  the nature of the wall street journal s circulation base  especially its distinctive demographics in particular  its influential and affluent audience that makes significant bb spending decisions and spends heavily on personal consumption items  is an important factor in generating circulation and advertising revenues 
if we are unable to maintain our core demographic audience  our overall profitability could decline 
our circulation revenues at the wall street journal and community newspapers may be negatively impacted by the preferences of many younger consumers for news in new media formats and from untraditional sources rather than from newspapers 
if these younger consumers maintain these preferences as they age  this could  in turn  adversely affect the willingness of advertisers to place ads with us and or the rates they are willing to pay 
although we seek to cost effectively maintain our circulation base and its distinctive demographics including by implementing content  organization and design changes to the wall street journal  we may not be successful in doing so 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to do so and we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover these costs through increased circulation and advertising revenues 
subscriptions certain of our electronic publishing businesses  including dow jones newswires  are subscriber based and are vulnerable to losses in the number of subscribers 
for example  dow jones newswires could lose subscriptions  measured by the number of terminals carrying dow jones newswires  as a result of business consolidations and layoffs in the financial services industry 
similarly  wsj 
com  which currently is the largest paid subscription news site on the internet  may not be able to continue to increase revenues through growing the number of subscribers 
unlike wsj 
com  our competitors do not  for the most part  utilize a full online paid subscription model  and most remain free web sites 

table of contents seasonality our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations  which typically cause revenues in the third quarter which includes the months of july and august to be lower than revenues in the remainder of the year 
cost structure we have done much cost cutting over the last several years  but we may not be able to continue limiting our expense growth 
factors that may impact our ability to control expense growth in the future include our prior cost cutting  the tightening of the labor market and the resulting risk of loss of key employees  and our planned growth initiatives  such as the marketwatch acquisition and the new weekend edition 
if we are unable to continue to control expense growth in the future  there may be an adverse effect on our overall profitability 
competition all of our products and services face intense competition from other newspapers  national business magazines  television  trade publications  newsletters  research reports and services  free and paid internet sites  and other new media 
we compete for advertising revenues  subscriptions and consumers  which include readers  online users and television viewers 
metropolitan general interest newspapers and many small city or suburban papers carry business and financial content  as do many internet based services as well as television and radio 
in addition  specialized magazines in the business and financial field  as well as general news magazines  publish substantial amounts of business related material 
the wall street journal also competes for advertising with non business publications offering audiences of high demographic quality  such as technology and lifestyle magazines 
circulation revenues at our community newspapers may be negatively impacted by local competition  including free publications 
nearly all of these other publications and services seek audiences and seek to sell advertising  making them competitive with our publications and services 
our efforts to expand in europe have been limited by substantial competition from local language publications  other international publications  and local and international television networks  as well as the limited nature of the foreign language market which we serve 
in asia  our presence with our pan asia publications may be threatened by developments within the region such that readers may prefer local language or local market publications 
as the economies of the various individual asian nations develop over time  we may encounter further difficulties in continuing to appeal to a broader pan asian audience 
our dow jones newswires business and financial news products are distributed through a limited number of vendors  which distribute our news over their platforms into financial services companies  which receive our content by way of subscriptions with these vendors 
newswires has entered into a bundling arrangement to deliver a selection of our news on all moneyline telerate terminals worldwide  this arrangement is important to newswires international revenues and may be adversely affected by the impending acquisition by reuters of the moneyline telerate business 
moreover  sales of our dow jones newswire products may continue to be negatively impacted by technological changes and changes in the brokerage industry  which have resulted in a diminishing reliance on real time news as business and financial news has become increasingly available via internet based publications and services 
in addition  as we strive to increase our international revenues from the dow jones newswires business  we may not succeed given the competition from and subscribers desire for  local language news services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase or to maintain the advertising  readership  circulation or subscriptions market share that we currently enjoy 
in addition  changes in the regulatory and technological environment are bringing about a global consolidation of media and telecommunications companies and convergence among various forms of media 
as a result  our operations could face increased competition from larger media entities 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks  trade names  copyrights  and other proprietary rights  as well as contractual arrangements  including licenses  to establish and protect our intellectual property and brand names 
we believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position 
dow jones indexes licenses  sometimes exclusively  our proprietary indexes and trademarks to exchanges and financial institutions for use as the basis of financial products 
for example  dow jones has licensed the dow jones industrial average index and related trademarks to the american stock exchange as the basis of the diamonds exchange traded fund 
two lawsuits relevant to the index licensing industry are pending in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
each of these suits is testing an index provider s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights with respect to certain licensing activities 
although we are not a party to either lawsuit  if the index provider s intellectual property rights are successfully challenged  our ability to license our own index related property for certain uses may be impaired and our revenues related to such licensing activities could be negatively impacted 

table of contents acquisitions from time to time  we seek out strategic and financially attractive core business acquisition opportunities 
such acquisitions may affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
acquisitions  including our recent acquisition of marketwatch  involve risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in integrating acquired operations  diversions of management resources and loss of key employees  challenges with respect to operating new businesses  debt incurred in financing such acquisitions including the related possible reduction in our credit ratings and increase in our cost of borrowing and unanticipated problems and liabilities 
new business opportunities and strategic alliances there are substantial uncertainties associated with our efforts to leverage our brands to develop new business opportunities and to generate advertising and other revenues from these products 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
for example  we may be unable to successfully control expenses relating to launching our new weekend edition and may not achieve the gains from advertising revenues that we hope to achieve 
we also face challenges in our attempts to achieve new strategic alliances and to improve the growth and profitability of existing strategic alliances 
for example  we occasionally make non controlling minority investments in public and private entities 
we may have limited voting rights and  therefore  an inability to influence the direction of such entities 
therefore  the success of these ventures may be dependent upon the efforts of our partners  fellow investors and licensees 
in addition  external factors  such as the development of competitive alternatives and market response  may negatively impact the success of these new opportunities and alliances 
mdc cantor fitzgerald legal proceeding we are currently party to a legal proceeding with market data corp 
mdc and cantor fitzgerald securities with respect to our obligations  if any  under a guarantee issued to mdc and cantor fitzgerald securities 
the guarantee relates to certain annual minimum payments owed through october by telerate under certain conditions for data acquired by telerate from cantor fitzgerald securities and mdc under contracts entered into by telerate when telerate was a subsidiary of ours 
we have established a reserve to cover payments we may need to make if we are required to perform under the guarantee to cantor fitzgerald securities and mdc 
however  if we are required to make payments under this guarantee  whether pursuant to a judgment in the litigation or a settlement agreement  those payments would negatively impact our cash flow 
labor relations approximately of our full time employees are unionized

our results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations caused work interruptions or if we are unable to negotiate agreements on reasonable terms 
in addition  in light of our efforts to manage expenses  we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  particularly as the labor market tightens and more opportunities are available elsewhere with higher wages 
newsprint prices newsprint is our single most important raw material and represented approximately of our total operating expenses in each of and the price of newsprint has historically been volatile 
consolidation in the north american newsprint industry has reduced the number of suppliers 
this has led to paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper  which  in turn  have decreased overall newsprint capacity and increased the likelihood of price increases in the future 
our operating results could be adversely affected if newsprint prices increase significantly 
world events our results of operations may be affected in various ways by events beyond our control  such as wars  political unrest  natural disasters and acts of terrorism 
the september th terrorist attacks in the united states and the war in iraq each contributed to a downturn in the us domestic economy that  in turn  resulted in a temporary decline in advertising 
similar events may occur in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
risks relating to marketwatch in addition to the acquisition related risks described under acquisitions above  in connection with our acquisition of marketwatch  we face the risk that the market for online advertising will not grow as rapidly as we expect or that we will ultimately be unable to capitalize on any such growth 
like our other online products and services  the marketwatch business is vulnerable to the following risks and uncertainties  among others competition for readers and advertising revenues  changes in demand for its products and services  including its licensing business  fluctuations in traffic levels on its web sites  and potential increased regulation  including with respect to privacy laws
