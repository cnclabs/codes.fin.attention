item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations executive overview elkcorp  through its subsidiaries  is primarily a manufacturer of elk premium roofing and composite building products 
we strive to be the brand of choice in each of our businesses 
in fiscal  we intensified our focus on our building products platforms  including selling or positioning for sale several of the businesses that do not fit into this focus 
additionally  on august   we acquired rgm products  inc  a privately held manufacturer of high profile hip and ridge and other roofing related products based in fresno  california  for approximately  in cash and the assumption of approximately  of indebtedness 
this acquisition enhances our current roofing accessories business and allows us to offer the broadest ridge product line in the industry 
rgm products  inc posted revenues of approximately  within the building products sector we have two segments  premium roofing products  which manufactures premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles and accessory products  coated and uncoated nonwoven fabrics used in asphalt shingles and other applications  and composite building products  a relatively new platform that manufactures composite wood decking  railing  marine dock  fencing and other oem products 
although reported as separate operating segments  products from both segments are manufactured for and marketed primarily to the building products industry under the elk premium building products brand name and meet most of the aggregation criteria established by sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
products from both segments are sold primarily through the same wholesale distribution channels and the ultimate customers for both segments are professional installation contractors and homeowners 
together these two building products segments account for greater than of consolidated sales and operating profit 
previously  these two segments were combined and reported as the building products segment 
prior period financial information has been reclassified to reflect the change in our reporting of business segments 
the focus of our businesses is innovative product development  manufacturing excellence and superior customer service 
fiscal was a year noteworthy for record demand for laminated shingles  particularly in the southeast region and certain other areas of the united states that were affected by four hurricanes in the summer and early fall of calendar year higher overall demand led to improved pricing in the majority of our markets throughout the country  but particularly in the southeast united states 
our shingle shipments increased compared to fiscal and average selling prices increased 
higher transportation  energy and raw materials costs  particularly asphalt costs  presented a significant challenge throughout fiscal as a result of improved selling prices  we were able to maintain higher margins on shingle pricing over transportation  energy and raw material costs in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
we expect a continuation of strong roofing demand in fiscal  fueled by longer than anticipated hurricane demand for our roofing products in florida 
rising average selling prices should help to offset raw material  energy  and transportation costs that are being affected by record price levels for crude oil 
we benefited significantly from the start up of our new tuscaloosa  alabama facility at the beginning of fiscal even though the new plant increased our operating costs  productivity was better than our expectations for this new facility for most of fiscal the plant achieved its initial rated capacity in the third quarter of fiscal at rated capacity  the new tuscaloosa plant increased our overall capacity by about 
we expect this facility to continue to improve its production capabilities in the future  but at a slower rate than we experienced in fiscal our composite building products business was a challenge in fiscal  resulting in disappointing financial results 
customer specification modifications  internal formulation changes and refinements  inventory valuation adjustments and higher than expected costs associated with the ramp up of this business platform all contributed to the current year loss in this platform 
however  we believe in this new platform s ability to meet its long term goals  and we have made enhancements to its management structure  invested in new capacity and finalized new agreements for our non decking products 
we believe these changes will position us to take advantage of significant potential growth opportunities in this business platform 
our two dissimilar businesses are combined and reported as other  technologies  as neither individually meet the materiality criteria for separate segment reporting 
these operations include chromium corporation chromium  which is a leading provider of hard chrome and other surface finishes designed to extend the life of steel machinery components operating in abrasive environments  and elk technologies  inc  which develops and markets fabrics 
table of contents featuring versashield fire retardant coatings designed for use outside of traditional building products applications  including bedding  home furnishings and other consumer products 
in fiscal  we made the decision to discontinue cybershield  inc cybershield and to sell cybershield or its assets 
in the current fiscal year  we sold substantially all of the assets of cybershield 
early in fiscal  we concluded that ortloff engineers  ltd ortloff and chromium do not fit into our focus on building products platforms and positioned them for sale 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  ortloff was sold for cash to a financial buyer 
chromium remains positioned for sale but will remain as one of our business platforms if it is not sold 
performance data the following table and subsequent discussion set forth performance data from our continuing operations  expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
this data and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
year ended june  sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative operating income interest expense  net and other income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance sales from continuing operations of  during the year ended june  were higher than  in fiscal during the year ended june   operating income from continuing operations of  was higher than the  last year 
sales of premium roofing shingles and accessory products increased substantially in the current year compared to last year  due to a significant increase in shingle unit volume  which was aided by shipments from the new tuscaloosa production facility  overall improvements in production performance  and higher average selling prices 
the percentage of cost of sales to sales increased to in the year ended june  compared to last year 
a higher than expected loss at the lenexa  kansas composite building products operation was the primary factor in the overall lower gross margin during fiscal selling  general and administrative s  g a costs of  in fiscal were higher than  last year due primarily to increased selling expense and performance based compensation expense 
however  due to substantially increased business activity and higher selling prices  s  g a was only of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal due primarily to higher debt levels  increasing interest rates and less capitalized interest 
for the year ended june    of interest was capitalized related to the expansion of the lenexa  kansas facility and other significant capital projects 
in fiscal   of interest was capitalized  much of which related to construction of the new roofing plant in tuscaloosa  alabama  which is now in service 
increased interest rates on variable rate debt accounted for an approximate  year to year increase in total interest cost 
average borrowings  net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  were approximately  higher in fiscal compared to fiscal the average interest rate paid on indebtedness was in fiscal compared to in fiscal as a result of higher variable interest rates and an additional  in senior notes issued in november with a fixed interest rate 

table of contents our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was during fiscal compared to in fiscal the lower current year rate was primarily attributable to lower state income taxes resulting from state investment tax credits from expansion programs 
in fiscal  we made the decision to exit cybershield s business 
in fiscal both cybershield and ortloff were sold 
both cybershield s and ortloff s results for each period presented are reported as discontinued operations 
in the year ended june   we reported pretax income from discontinued operations of  in fiscal  we reported a  pretax loss from discontinued operations 
the fiscal results included a  pretax gain on the disposal of ortloff 
fiscal results included  of write downs of cybershield s net assets to estimated market value 
results of business segments sales in the premium roofing products segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  last year 
compared to fiscal  unit volume increased in fiscal shingle demand was extremely high for most of fiscal as a result of increased orders in most regions of the united states  led by the southeast united states and other areas affected by four hurricanes in the summer and early fall of calendar we were able to benefit significantly from increased production capacity related to the new tuscaloosa  alabama roofing plant and productivity enhancements at all of our roofing facilities 
average shingle prices in the current year increased compared to last year  primarily as a result of price increases that were consistent with industry trends 
approximately of a price increase in june has been realized  and an additional price increase has been announced for september  these increases  if realized  should help offset rising asphalt and transportation costs 
in fiscal  external sales of performance nonwoven fabrics increased to  compared to  last year  primarily as a result of sales of specialty fabrics products  such as roofing mat  facer and filtration products 
operating income for the premium roofing products segment of  for the year ended june  increased from  achieved in the prior fiscal year 
this significant improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in unit volume and average selling prices 
we were able to improve margins on premium asphalt shingle products as a result of higher average sales prices despite continuing increases in asphalt  energy  and transportation costs 
asphalt costs increased approximately in the year ended june  from fiscal transportation costs have also continued to increase and were approximately higher in the current year than in the prior fiscal year 
the new tuscaloosa  alabama roofing plant reached its initial rated capacity in the quarter ended march  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the new tuscaloosa facility experienced lower than expected volume due to unanticipated machine maintenance 
the rate of progress in production has slowed at this plant as these maintenance issues are addressed 
also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we encountered a silo failure in the granule storage system at our myerstown facility that reduced production to approximately of capacity 
the plant has been able to return to capacity while repairs are being made  although there can be no assurance that this level of production will be sustainable throughout the repair process 
various engineering refinements designed to eliminate the problem areas at the myerstown and tuscaloosa plants are scheduled for completion during the first half of fiscal sales of our composite building products segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  in the prior fiscal year  as we continue to develop this business platform by improving and increasing our product line so that we are in a position to take advantage of better demand as consumers become more aware of the benefits of composite lumber compared to wood 
we incurred an  operating loss in our composite lumber business in fiscal compared to a  operating loss for this business in the prior year 
approximately  of the current year loss was attributable to costs associated with inventory for products that did not meet our current formulations and customer specifications 
we believe we have alleviated many of the problems surrounding the formulation and specifications issues through management changes and process control improvements made in the latter part of fiscal additional fiscal losses of approximately  resulted from the expansion of operations at our new manufacturing facility in lenexa  kansas 
other factors contributing to the higher than expected fiscal loss were longer than anticipated code approval in various areas of the country  a slower than expected ramp up of new production  higher than anticipated raw material costs  and slower than projected initiation of new products for non decking markets 
in fiscal  our composite distribution base increased more than to approximately distributors in the united states and canada 
we believe in this new platform s ability to meet its long term goals 
the enhancements in the management structure  in combination with capacity additions and finalizing new agreements for our non decking products are expected to allow us to take advantage of significant growth opportunities in this business platform 

table of contents in march  the composite building products subsidiary completed the acquisition of railwayz inc railwayz  a privately held composite railing company 
railwayz manufactures railing products that will complement our crosstimbers decking products and allow us to offer our distributors a more diverse decking and railing product line 
the total purchase price was approximately  plus contingent future earn out payments based on revenues for the first five years after acquisition with a maximum potential payment of  the other  technologies companies reported combined sales of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal chromium s sales were  or higher in the current year compared to  in fiscal period as a result of slightly higher demand for plating and finishing services in existing locomotive and marine markets 
the other  technologies companies had a combined operating loss of  in fiscal  compared to a  operating loss last year 
chromium recorded an operating profit of  for the year ended june   which included a  reserve for estimated environmental clean up at its former plating operation located in lufkin  texas and a  provision for bad debt expenses 
this operating profit compares to a  operating profit achieved last year 
elk technologies incurred an operating loss of  in the year ended june   compared to an operating loss of  in the same period last year 
the current year operating loss included  in inventory write downs 
fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance sales from continuing operations of  in fiscal were higher than  in fiscal during fiscal  income from continuing operations of  was higher than  for the prior fiscal year 
included in income from continuing operations in fiscal was  of benefit  net of tax  from the reversal of noncash stock option compensation 
consolidated operating income from continuing operations of  in fiscal was higher than  in fiscal operating income from continuing operations in fiscal included a  pretax benefit as a result of the aforementioned noncash stock option compensation 
cost of sales was of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal higher asphalt and other raw material costs during much of fiscal were largely offset by better shingle pricing and increased shingle production  which reduced per unit manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal were higher than in the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased business activity and higher marketing expenses 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense  net  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  interest expense of  was capitalized related to the construction of an additional shingle plant in tuscaloosa  alabama  and other significant capital projects 
in fiscal   of interest was capitalized 
the average interest rate paid on indebtedness was in both fiscal and fiscal our effective tax rate from continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to state tax credits generated as a result of roofing plant production improvement initiatives 
in december  we made the decision to exit cybershield s business 
cybershield s results for all periods presented are reported as discontinued operations 
discontinued operations for fiscal included a  pretax loss from operations at cybershield  combined with pretax  noncash write downs of  to reduce the book value of cybershield s assets to estimated market value 
in fiscal  cybershield reported a  pretax operating loss  all from operating activities 
ortloff  which is also reported as a discontinued operation  had pretax income of approximately  in fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal results of business segments sales in the premium roofing products segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the significant year to year increase in sales is primarily the result of an  or  increase in sales of premium shingles and accessory products 
compared to the same period in fiscal  unit shingle shipments increased  with most regions of the united states experiencing strong year to year growth 
a significant portion of the unit volume increase  particularly during the early part of fiscal  was attributable to strong roof replacement demand in hail damaged texas markets 
average shingle pricing increased about compared to fiscal in fiscal  external sales of performance nonwoven fabrics increased  or to  
table of contents compared to  in fiscal approximately two thirds of roofing mat produced in both fiscal and fiscal was used for internal consumption 
internal sales of roofing mat are eliminated in consolidation 
operating income for the premium roofing products segment of  for fiscal increased compared to  achieved in fiscal operating income gains attributable to higher unit sales and pricing were partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses  raw material price increases  higher transportation costs and unusually high developmental costs related to new product offerings in the roofing business 
sales of composite building products were  in fiscal we entered the composite building products business in the second quarter of fiscal and reported  in sales in fiscal we incurred an operating loss of  for the composite building products business during fiscal compared to a  operating loss in fiscal the other  technologies companies reported combined sales of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal chromium s sales were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of increased demand for plating and finishing services in existing locomotive and marine markets  combined with increased hard chrome wear plate sales 
elk technologies had a nominal level of sales of fire retardant mattress fabrics during fiscal other  technologies companies had a combined operating loss of  in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of  in fiscal the improvement was due primarily to higher sales activity levels at chromium which recorded an operating profit of  in fiscal year compared to incurring a small operating loss in fiscal financial condition overview our liquidity needs generally arise principally from working capital requirements  capital expenditures  dividends  and interest payments 
our working capital requirements typically fluctuate significantly during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements are higher in the spring and summer months and lower in the fall and winter months 
due to unprecedented demand for roofing products caused by four hurricanes in the southeast united states in early fiscal  our business was less seasonal this year than normal 
during the three years ended june   we relied primarily on internally generated funds and proceeds from the sale of senior unsecured notes to finance our capital expenditure requirements and other growth opportunities 
we typically use our revolving credit facility facility to finance higher working capital requirements 
due to strong cash flow in fiscal and the issuance of an additional  in senior unsecured notes on november   we used the facility sparingly in fiscal  and did not borrow under the facility in the second half of the year 
at june   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to fund growth opportunities  capital expenditures and other cash requirements 
approximately  of available funds was utilized on august  in connection with the acquisition of rgm products  inc operating activities we generate cash flows from operating activities primarily from income from operations  after consideration of deferred taxes  stock based compensation  stock option income tax benefits  depreciation and amortization 
cash flows from operating activities also either increase or decrease by changes in working capital requirements 
for the year ended june   we generated cash of  from operating activities  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal trade receivables at june  were  higher than at june  due primarily to higher shipments of premium roofing products in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with normal industry practices  extended payment terms are granted to certain customers for roofing products shipped during the late winter and early spring months  with payments generally due during the spring and early summer 
at june   receivables from customer programs with extended due dates were  compared to  at june  extended term receivables outstanding at june  are due in the first quarter of fiscal at june   manufactured inventories were  higher than at june  much of the increase related to higher inventories at the new tuscaloosa  alabama facility  and at the composite building products business platform from increasing production capacity 
current liabilities were significantly higher in fiscal  due primarily to cash management initiatives  increased compensation related accruals  and increased business activities 
the current ratio was to at june  compared to to at june  
table of contents investing activities cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect our capital expenditure strategy  together with activity relating to short term investments 
net cash used for investing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  and  in fiscal we purchased short term investments net of investment sales and redemptions of short term investments of  in fiscal these investments will be used to fund operations and growth opportunities  including acquisitions 
approximately  of these funds was used in our august   acquisition of rgm products  inc approximately  of fiscal capital expenditures relate to the expansion of our composite building products facility in lenexa  kansas 
as previously discussed  the new tuscaloosa  alabama  roofing plant was completed and placed in service at the beginning of fiscal we also invested approximately  in fiscal relating to a major project to upgrade certain key information systems 
this project was completed and the systems placed in service on november  excluding major capacity initiatives such as the lenexa expansion  consolidated capital expenditures are generally expected to be approximately  per year 
financing activities cash flows from financing activities generally reflect changes in our borrowings  together with dividends paid on common stock  and exercises of stock options 
net cash generated from financing activities was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  and  in fiscal in november  we closed an agreement to issue an additional  in senior unsecured notes in a private placement transaction with a group of institutional investors 
this transaction was initiated to provide funds for growth and expansion initiatives 
we are continuing to evaluate possible acquisitions to extend our building products lines of business 
at june   liquidity consisted of  of cash and cash equivalents   of short term investments  and  of available borrowings under the  committed line of credit facility 
at june   the debt to capital ratio after deducting cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  from  of long term principal debt was 
our board of directors has authorized our repurchase of common stock from time to time on the open market 
as of june   we have repurchase authority of approximately  remaining 
we did not make any open market purchases of common stock in the year ended june  all purchases of equity securities in fiscal related to repurchases in connection with stock option exercises and restricted shares  and from the elkcorp esop trust as a result of participant diversification directives and account balance distributions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future payments relating to contractual obligations at june  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt notes payable  including imputed interest interest on fixed rate debt operating leases total contractual obligations at june    of long term debt was variable rate debt  at an average interest rate of 
interest expense on variable rate debt is not included in the above table as it cannot be reasonably estimated 
our only other significant commercial commitment at june  is our  revolving credit facility  the term of which extends through november  there was no outstanding balance on this facility at june  
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  limited purpose entities 
acquisition subsequent to year end in august  a subsidiary of the company acquired rgm products  inc rgm  a fresno  california based privately held manufacturer of ridge and roofing related products 
rgm s products enhance the company s roofing product accessory business and broaden its ridge product line 
the total purchase price was approximately  existing cash resources of approximately  were used to fund the acquisition and approximately  of long term debt and capital lease obligations were assumed 
environmental our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
such environmental laws are frequently changed and could result in significantly increased cost of compliance 
certain of our manufacturing operations utilize hazardous materials in their production processes 
as a result  we incur costs for remediation activities off site and at our facilities from time to time 
we establish and maintain reserves for such remediation activities  when appropriate 
current reserves established for known or probable remediation activities are not material to our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions we believe are reasonable based on the information available 
the accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following collectibility of accounts receivable the majority of our sales are in the premium roofing products and composite building products segments and our primary customers in both segments are building products distributors 
due to consolidation in the industry  credit risk is concentrated 
ten customers account for approximately of consolidated sales 
the balance in the reserve for doubtful accounts is evaluated on an ongoing basis based on a combination of factors such as customers past payment history  length of time the receivables are past due  the status of customers financial condition and ongoing credit evaluations 
accruals for loss contingencies contingencies  or uncertainties  by their nature  require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of loss 
accruals are established for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
accrual balances are reviewed and adjusted periodically based on our judgment of changes in specific facts and circumstances for each loss accrual 
key loss accruals for the company include product warranties product warranties are estimated and recorded based on various factors such as an examination of submitted claims for potential exposure  claims paid history  independent data as to average length of time between asphalt roofing replacements and other factors 
litigation litigation reserves are determined on a case specific basis from evaluations by both management and outside counsel as to any probable exposure from litigation capable of reasonable estimation 
environmental exposure environmental exposure  primarily related to chromium  is evaluated by management and our environmental consultants when known or anticipated exposure is identified and quantifiable 

table of contents self insurance reserves we are partially insured against losses for both casualty and medical claims 
reserves are calculated and maintained based on historical experience and specifically identified losses 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the value of inventories based on various factors 
adjustments may be made to inventory values based on the physical condition eg age and quality of the inventories 
for the other  technologies companies  inventory adjustments are generally based upon the forecasted plans to sell their products and the sales prices that are expected to be realized 
inventories are adjusted to the lower of cost or market or written off if unsaleable 
these adjustments are estimates and can vary from actual requirements if inventories deteriorate  become otherwise damaged or obsolete  or if competitive conditions differ from expectations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the majority of sales are for manufactured products  where revenue is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers 
such revenues are subject to returns  discounts  volume rebates and other incentives  which are estimated and recorded based on sales activity and historical trends 
differences in revenues could result if actual experience differs from the historical trends used in management s estimates 
revenue recognition may be subject to judgment and interpretation that the specific requirements of sab have been met 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  primarily plant  property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of any such assets may not be recoverable 
if the estimated sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  industry conditions  customer requirements  technology or our business model 
stock based compensation included in our stock based compensation are performance stock awards  which were granted for the first time in fiscal compensation expense for performance stock awards is based on our estimate of the number of shares that will be issued at the end of the performance period 
the estimated number of shares that will be issued and the related compensation expense will be adjusted periodically based on our judgment of facts  circumstances and forecasted performance 
upon the adoption of sfas r share based payments  in fiscal  discussed below under new accounting pronouncements  variable accounting for performance stock will no longer be utilized 
rather  compensation expense will be determined based on the fair value of performance stock at the date of grant 
new accounting standards in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act provides tax relief to us domestic manufacturers 
the financial accounting standards board fasb directed its staff to issue financial staff position fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas states that a manufacturer s deduction provided for under the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas and not as a tax rate reduction 
the special deduction should be considered by a company in measuring deferred taxes when the company is subject to graduated tax rates  and assessing whether a valuation allowance is necessary as required by sfas the adoption of this fsp did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position for fiscal the company is currently evaluating the effect that the fsp will have on its financial position and results of operations in subsequent years and believes the effect of fsp fas will be to lower income tax expense beginning in fiscal in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 inventory pricing 
sfas no 
requires all companies to recognize a current period charge for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials 
the statement also requires that 
table of contents the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this new standard will be effective for the company beginning in fiscal the company does not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  and will be effective for the company beginning in fiscal this new standard may be adopted in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
the company believes the effect of the adoption of sfas r will result in higher compensation expense in fiscal the current estimated cost of all elements of stock based compensation  including stock options  is  in fiscal market risks in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we are exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices and interest rates 
we have no significant foreign exchange risk 
derivatives are held as part of a formally documented risk management program 
derivatives are held to mitigate uncertainty  volatility or to cover underlying exposures 
no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
we have entered into derivative transactions related to interest rate risk and our exposure to fluctuating prices of natural gas used in our manufacturing plants  as summarized in the following paragraphs 
we are required to purchase natural gas for use in our manufacturing facilities 
these purchases expose us to the risk of higher natural gas prices 
to hedge this risk  we may enter into hedge transactions to fix the price on a portion of our projected natural gas usage 
there were no natural gas hedge transactions in effect in fiscal however  it is anticipated that hedging strategies will likely be utilized in the future 
we use interest rate swaps to help maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt 
we have entered into two interest rate swaps to effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on  of our outstanding debt at june  the net fair value of these swaps was  at june  based on outstanding debt at june   our annual interest costs would increase or decrease  for each theoretical increase or decrease in the floating interest rate 
credit risk we are subject to credit risks applicable to cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable and derivative instruments 
cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions or in short term investments with high credit quality 
short term investments are primarily in tax exempt vehicles of high credit quality  including closed end municipal bonds and variable rate demand notes issued by municipalities 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable primarily relate to the large building products distributors that are our primary customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have not experienced significant credit losses for many years 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to those customers to whom we make significant sales 
our largest customer accounted for of consolidated sales in both fiscal and derivative contracts are entered into with counterparties who are  in our opinion  creditworthy counterparties 
inflation and changing prices our primary financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america based on historical dollars 
accordingly  the financial statements do not portray the effects of inflation 
in recent years  inflation in our key markets has been moderate  and cost controls and improving productivity have generally minimized the impact of inflation 
the costs of manufacturing  transportation and key raw materials  including but not limited to ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins  mineral filler  polypropylene  wood particles and various additives for product preservation  together with our ability to pass along higher costs are generally influenced by factors other than inflation 
these factors include general economic and industry conditions  supply and demand  surpluses and shortages  and actions of key competitors
