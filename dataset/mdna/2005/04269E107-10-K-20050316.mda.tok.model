item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of small molecule cancer therapeutics 
we also provide fee based chemistry services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to produce novel chemical compounds with drug like characteristics 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million from inception through december  our expenses prior to september related to development activities associated with our chemistry services  the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts  and the cost of acquisitions 
we expect research and development costs to increase in as we pursue development of our cancer programs 
we do not expect to make additional investments in chemistry services during as we continue to reinvest our positive cash flow from chemistry services into research and development 
although we have generated positive cash flow from operations for the last six years  we have recorded a net loss for each of those years 
we expect to record a loss for based on our cash position at the end of we will be able to dedicate approximately million per year over the next three years to our act sm research and development program 
this estimate is based upon the assumption that we will continue to operate our chemistry services on a cash flow positive basis  and to invest in cancer related research and development 
our revenue is derived from chemistry services performed for customers and research and development funding from our alliance with roche 
revenue  expenses and gross margin fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  notably the timing and extent of our cancer related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials  and our chemistry services contractual deliverables and the timing of the recognition of revenue under our revenue recognition policy see the discussion of this under critical accounting policies below 
while our focus will be on cancer related 
table of contents research and development  we will continue to pursue revenue opportunities from customers for our chemistry services 
in february  we amended our contract with pfizer 
under the amended terms of the contract arqule will continue to work with pfizer s scientists to match more closely its compound deliveries to those libraries which pfizer believes represent the greatest developmental opportunities 
under this new agreement  arqule will maintain compound deliveries at approximately the same level to be supplied in instead of increasing compound deliveries as specified in the previous agreement 
if our amended relationship with pfizer is successful  we could earn up to million over the term of the contract 
on april  we announced an alliance with roche to discover and develop drug candidates targeting the ef biological pathway 
the alliance includes a compound that is currently in phase clinical development 
under the terms of the agreement  roche obtained an option to license our ef program in the field of cancer therapy 
roche provided immediate research funding of million  and will provide financial support for ongoing research and development 
we are responsible for advancing drug candidates ranging from early stage development to phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  we could receive up to million in pre determined payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
additionally  we have the option to co promote products in the us on january   we completed a stock offering in which we sold million shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million after commissions and offering expenses 
liquidity and capital resources increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities 
the uses of our cash flow from operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices and laboratories  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies and materials  and professional fees 
the sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted of payments from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services 
for  the net source of funds of million was primarily due to the upfront research funding from roche of million  an operating profit excluding non cash charges of million and from reductions in accounts receivable based on the timing of customer payments  partially offset by million related to payments of severance and facility related restructuring costs and the current year restructuring credit  million of reductions on accounts payable and accruals resulting from the timing of vendor payments at year end  million related to an increase in prepaid expense due to the timing of payments for service contracts and million related to the recognition of deferred revenues 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities 
the total use was million in  compared to million in the use was comprised of capital expenditures of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and 
table of contents marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and the company s near term need for liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities 
the total use was million in compared to million in the use was comprised of debt principal repayments of million  primarily associated with the company s paydown of all term debt with bank of america former fleet national bank  partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we have been cash flow positive from operations for six consecutive years  although we do not expect to be cash flow positive from operations in we expect that our available cash and marketable securities  totaling approximately million after the january stock offering  together with operating results and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements for the next three years 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into any additional corporate collaborations in the future and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  the need for currently unanticipated capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers for our chemistry services  or that such services will produce revenues adequate to fund our operating expenses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
if we experience increased losses  we may have to seek additional financing from public and private sale of our securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when needed or on acceptable terms 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payment due by period within within within after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total included in the total minimum payments for operating leases is approximately million related to unoccupied real estate in california which was accrued as a liability  net of contractual sublease income  as a part of the company s restructuring charge in and subsequently adjusted in and see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
for additional information  please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 

table of contents compound development revenue recognition historically  arqule has entered into various collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which arqule produces and delivers compound arrays and provides research and development services 
revenue elements from collaborative agreements include non refundable technology transfer fees  funding of compound development work  payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting collaborators specific criteria and certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
in each instance  the company analyzes each distinct revenue element of the contract to determine the basis for revenue recognition 
revenue for each element is generally recognized over the period compounds are delivered and or services are performed  provided there is a contractual obligation on behalf of the customer to pay arqule and payment is reasonably assured 
the nature of each distinct revenue element  the facts surrounding the services provided  and arqule s ongoing obligations to provide those services dictate how revenue is recognized for each revenue element 
this accounting conforms to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  in particular staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and is disclosed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in may  the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
eitf became effective for new revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  in february  the company entered into an amended contract with pfizer 
the amendment modified the quantity and composition of compounds to be produced and delivered by arqule  with a corresponding adjustment to the remaining contractual billings for undelivered elements under the contract 
we concluded that the modification was substantial enough to require evaluation of the contract to determine if eitf applied 
we concluded that because the contract does contain multiple deliverables license to technology  research services and compound deliveries eitf did apply 
we determined that there was not sufficient evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements compounds  and therefore the amended contract represented a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
as a result  in q arqule began treating the amended pfizer agreement as a single unit of accounting and recognizing revenue based on the delivery of compounds against the contractual compound delivery schedule 
we follow these guidelines to measure revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of these policies 
for example  in connection with our pfizer collaboration we have recorded current and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
the estimate of deferred revenue reflects our estimate of the timing and extent of services that we will provide to pfizer 
our services to pfizer  and the timing of those services  are difficult to estimate and are impacted by factors outside of our control 
for example  the timing and quantity of compounds we provide is largely dependent on pfizer s internal needs 
changes to estimates could impact the timing and amount of revenue we recognize in the future 

table of contents compound development revenue was derived from the following contractual elements in  and in thousands non refundable technology transfer payments funding of compound development payments based on delivery of specialized compounds milestone payments total compound development revenue before  arqule recognized revenue from pfizer based on the individual contractual elements of the collaborative agreement 
as noted above  in as a result of the amended pfizer agreement and the adoption of eitf  the company began to account for pfizer revenue as a single unit of accounting 
in  pfizer revenue in above table is fully included in payments based on delivery of specialized compounds 
research and development revenue recognition under the terms of the roche agreement  roche obtained an option to license arqule s ef program in the field of cancer therapy 
roche provided immediate research funding of million  and financial support for ongoing research and development 
arqule is responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage development into phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  arqule could receive up to million in pre determined milestone payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
arqule considers the development portion of the arrangement to be a single unit of accounting under eitf for purposes of revenue recognition  and will recognize the initial and ongoing development payments as research and development revenue over the maximum estimated development period 
we estimate the maximum development period could extend until december  although this period may ultimately be shorter depending upon the outcome of the development work  which would result in accelerated recognition of the development revenue 
milestone and royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the cost associated with satisfying the roche contract is included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
purchase accounting and in process research and development upon consummation of the cyclis acquisition  we immediately charged to income million representing purchased in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
approximately million of the charge represents the fair value of the ipr d  the remaining million of the charge represents the allocation to ipr d of a portion of the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired 
we believe that this charge represents a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributed to purchased ipr d 
the value assigned ipr d before the step up adjustment was the projected value of three cyclis preclinical drug development projects based on various mechanisms of actions associated with the act sm technology 
the valuation was determined using the income approach 
potential revenue and drug development expenses were projected through based on information obtained from management and from published third party industry statistics for similar drug development businesses 
specifically  we estimated that the development of our current cancer programs through clinical trials to commercial viability will take approximately nine years and cost in excess of million 
the discounted cash flow method was applied to the projected cash flows  adjusted for the probability of success  using a discount rate of 
the discount rate takes into consideration the uncertainty surrounding successful development and commercialization of the ipr d 
since the acquisition  nothing has occurred that would lead us to believe that the original 
table of contents estimates of the cost to develop these compounds  or their revenue potential  is materially different from the estimates used at the time of the acquisition for purposes of purchase accounting 
restructuring charges credits accruals for abandoned facilities under lease requires significant management judgment and the use of estimates  including assumptions concerning the ability of a sublessee to fulfill its contractual sublease obligations 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the company s abandoned facility in redwood city  california 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease 
as a result of signing the sublease  we adjusted our accrual for abandoned facilities to reflect the full amount of the anticipated sublease income to be received 
this assumption about the subleasee s ability to fulfill its contractual obligation is based on an analysis of their financial position and ability to generate future working capital 
if the subleasee is unable to meet its obligations  and the company is unable to enter into another sublease for the facility  arqule may be required to adjust its restructuring accrual and record additional restructuring expense of up to million 
investments in non marketable equity securities at december   we performed an assessment of the fair value of our investment in a privately held proteomics company 
this assessment included analysis of that company s current financial condition  its prospects for generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the current market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this analysis it was our judgment that an impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was million  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
the was no indication of further impairment in if this entity is unsuccessful in its efforts to secure additional financing it may cease operations  rendering our investment worthless and necessitating a further write down 
if the value of this investment recovers  we will not write up the investment until it is sold 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue increase decrease to to in millions compound development revenue research and development revenue total revenue 
table of contents as compared to compound development revenue in decreased by million  or  from revenue from our chemistry based collaboration with pfizer was million  a decrease of million  or  from although the number of compounds delivered to pfizer in were approximately the same as in  in the fourth quarter of arqule received a contractual milestone payment on an accelerated basis which increased revenue 
beginning in  as a result of the amended pfizer agreement and the application of eitf  arqule began recognizing revenue from pfizer based solely on the number of compounds produced and shipped ie all obligations were treated as a single unit of accounting rather than based on individual contractual elements 
see revenue recognition under critical accounting policies and estimates contained herein for more information 
compound development revenue was also lower in due to a reduction in revenue from bayer of million  sankyo of million  pharmacia of million and johnson johnson of million  all the result of contracts which ended at various times in and partially offsetting the decrease was a million of milestone revenue from wyeth related to the advancement by wyeth of three compounds  the discovery of which were facilitated by a collaboration with arqule and b an increase in revenue from novartis of million related to a compound development contract entered into in the latter half of that was in effect for all of research and development revenue is comprised of revenue from roche in connection with the alliance agreement signed in april as compared to compound development revenue increased by million  or 
revenue from our chemistry collaboration with pfizer increased by million due to an increase in the number of compounds developed under the terms of the contract and our receipt of certain contractual milestone payments on an accelerated basis because we met delivery requirements in ahead of schedule 
this increase was offset by reductions in revenue from bayer of million  solvay of million  and pharmacia of million as the company completed its final contractual obligations with these companies in  and from reductions in revenue from searle of million  wyeth of million and glaxo smith kline of million as a result of contract completions in cost of revenue compound development and gross margin percentage increase decrease to to in millions cost of revenue compound development gross margin of revenue pts pts as compared to cost of revenue compound development decreased in absolute dollars primarily due to reduced material and supply costs necessary to satisfy the bayer  sankyo  pharmacia and johnson and johnson contracts which ended at various times in and  lower depreciation charges resulting from reduced capital spending in new equipment and a lower depreciable basis in existing capital equipment  and a reduction in personnel dedicated to compound development as a result of the amended pfizer collaborative agreement and the corporate restructuring in the first quarter of see restructuring actions below 
compound development gross margin percentage was lower in due partially to a a higher gross margin percentage in as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue from bayer at the end of that contract in for which the associated costs were incurred in prior years and the recognition of a contracted milestone from pfizer on an accelerated basis which increased revenue with no associated cost  and b partially to a lower gross margin percentage in resulting from the lower overall level of revenue available to offset fixed overhead and facility related expenses 
as compared to cost of revenue compound development increased due to increased cost of personnel  materials and facility related expenses  including depreciation  necessary to satisfy the increase in activity under the pfizer contract during  partially offset by a reduction in material costs associated with the completion of the bayer contract during the third quarter of gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily as a result of the one time increase in pfizer revenue due to our receipt of certain contractual milestone payments on an accelerated basis because we met delivery requirements in ahead 
table of contents of schedule and to the recognition of previously deferred revenue from bayer as a result of our completing our contractual obligations  the associated costs for which were incurred in earlier years 
research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development overview arqule s research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license  and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products 
these costs include those incurred in conjunction with research and development revenue 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology programs 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
in addition  we use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects  and many of our costs are not attributable to an individually named project  rather they are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis 
while we cannot state the internal costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis  we estimate that payments made by us to third parties for preclinical and clinical trials in and since inception of each program were as follows in thousands oncology program current status program to date ef modulation arq phase   ef modulation series preclinical cancer survival protein modulation series preclinical we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future oncology programs 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology  and efficacy 
we then may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for the preclinical and clinical development of these types of products to each take nine years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years 
table of contents the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term adverse events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad pipeline of products  our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases 
our strategy includes the option of entering in alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreement with roche 
in the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
as compared to the increase in research and development expense in primarily consists of an increase in personnel related cost of million related to the hiring of additional scientists and million related to the cost of pre clinical and clinical trials to advance further the ef program 
the cost increases were partially offset by million of costs incurred in related to the recruitment of a key employee and severance paid certain senior managers which were not incurred in at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  up from at december  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in as we expand our oncology discovery pipeline and begin preclinical and clinical trials as part of the development process 
as compared to the million decrease in research and development primarily reflects the cost savings associated with our decision in december to cease further development of the camitro predictive modeling technology  to close the related facilities in redwood city  california effective december  and cambridge  united kingdom effective march   and to realign our workforce in order to expedite its transition to a drug discovery and development company 
these cost savings were partially offset by the increased cost associated with the acquisition of cyclis in september  notably the addition of approximately scientists  increased laboratory supply and facility expenses and the cost of preclinical and clinical studies to develop the act sm platform and arq 
table of contents marketing  general and administrative increase decrease to to in millions marketing  general and administrative as compared to marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in in february  we eliminated administrative positions as part of our restructuring actions to reallocate resources to our oncology and drug discovery efforts causing a reduction in personnel and infrastructure expenses of million 
the cost saving associated with these personnel reductions were partially offset by increases in legal expenses of million related to the negotiation of the alliance agreement with roche in the first quarter of and increased costs associated with protecting our intellectual property 
as compared to the decrease in marketing  general and administrative expense is primarily due to the cost savings associated with the severance of marketing  general and administrative employees as part of the company s restructuring actions in december  and the closing of the redwood city and cambridge facilities 
the decrease consists primarily of reductions in employee related expenses of million  professional fees of million and facility related expense of million 
acquisition related charges in millions stock based compensation amortization of core technology amortization of goodwill impairment of core technology impairment of goodwill in process research and development total acquisition related charges acquisition related charges in relate to the september  acquisition of cyclis 
upon consummation of the cyclis acquisition  we immediately charged to income million representing purchased in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
approximately million of the charge represents the fair value of the ipr d 
the remaining million of the charge represents a step up adjustment resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed which was allocated on a pro rata basis to the carrying value of acquired long lived assets 
see critical accounting policies and estimates above for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant estimates 
acquisition related charges in all relate to the january acquisition of camitro 
upon consummation of the acquisition in january  we immediately charged to income million representing the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this k 
in  we continued to recognize stock based compensation charges based on the amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of stock options issued below market value and restricted stock to former employees of camitro  in addition to amortizing core technology 
we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in january  and accordingly ceased recording periodic goodwill amortization charges in lieu of performing annual assessments for impairment 
at december   we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of our core technology and goodwill balances and  based on the applicable accounting standards  recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  representing the entire remaining balances of

see critical accounting policies and estimates above for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant estimates 
restructuring related charges credits in december  we announced a restructuring of our operations whereby we ceased further development and commercialization of the camitro predictive modeling technology and realigned our workforce to expedite the transition towards becoming a drug discovery company 
the restructuring actions included closing our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge  united kingdom  along with the termination of employees in these facilities and our massachusetts facilities 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million  the components of which are as follows in thousands termination benefits facilities related other charges total restructuring charges termination benefits relate to severance and benefit costs associated with the elimination of managerial and staff positions worldwide  comprising approximately of the workforce 
facility related costs relate to the remaining lease payment obligations associated with the abandonment of our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge and the non cash write off of leasehold improvements and equipment no longer expected to provide future economic benefit at the abandoned facilities  less assumed proceeds from sale 
other charges include a million non cash stock compensation charge  contractual obligations which provided no future value to the company  and other miscellaneous costs associated with closing the california and united kingdom operations 
see item in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this k 
we believe that these actions resulted in savings of approximately million per year in personnel and facility related expenses 
in october  arqule completed an agreement with inpharmatica ltd 
to sell certain assets of its former operations in the united kingdom 
as a result  arqule reversed million of restructuring accrual to reflect a change in its original estimate of the remaining lease obligations and assumed sublease income in the united kingdom 
throughout the latter half of  arqule was in negotiations with a third party to sublease its facility in california on favorable terms 
those negotiations were terminated in january as a result  the adequacy of the accrual relative to the lease obligation and assumed sublease income for the california facility was reassessed  and based on continued deterioration in the local real estate market  an additional provision of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring to shift resources from our chemical technologies business to our internal cancer therapy research 
the restructuring included the termination of staff and managerial employees  or approximately of the workforce  in the following areas in chemistry production positions  in chemistry based research and development positions  and in administrative positions 
the company anticipates annualized saving of approximately million associated with the terminations 
in connection with these actions we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the first quarter of for termination benefits 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the california facility 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease obligation 
as a result of signing the sublease  we reassessed the remaining restructuring accrual and  since the sublease was on terms more favorable than previously estimated  we recorded a million restructuring credit in the third quarter of
