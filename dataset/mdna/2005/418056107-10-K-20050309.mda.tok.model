thousands of dollars and shares except per share data executive summary the company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products both within the united states and in international markets 
most of the company s products are either internally developed or licensed from outside inventors 
in addition to the products based on its own core brands  the company also offers internally developed products tied to licensed movie and television based entertainment properties 
the company s principal business strategies focus on growing its core brands  developing new and innovative toy and game products  and increasing operating margins by optimizing efficiencies within the company 
management views the company s principal product opportunities as falling into three general categories core brands  innovative new products and licensed entertainment based products 
although the company intends to continue to offer products based on licensed entertainment properties  in the past four years the company has actively sought to reduce its reliance on products based on theatrical properties and to achieve more consistent performance by focusing greater resources on the development and growth of its core brands and on developing innovative products 
the company s core brands represent company owned or company controlled brands  such as gi joe  transformers  my little pony  monopoly  magic the gathering  playskool and tonka  which the company views as presenting potential to be successful over the long term 
the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands  which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time 
by focusing on core brands  the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth 
however  the volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the toy and game industry make it difficult to maintain the long term success of existing product lines and to consistently introduce successful new products 
in addition to its focus on core brands  the company s strategy also involves trying to meet ever changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities 
in  innovative products such as videonow color were significant contributors to revenue for the company 
the company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the company from being dependent on the success of any one product line 
while the company s strategy focuses on growing its core brands and the development of innovative  new products  the company continues to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license movie and television entertainment based properties when the company believes it is economically beneficial 
theatrical entertainment based licenses in included dreamworks shrek ii  disney s the incredibles  and lucasfilm s star wars 
although gross profits of theatrical entertainment based products are generally higher  this increased gross margin is offset by royalty expenses incurred on these sales  as well as amortization expense of property right based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties 
in recent years  the company has also focused on reducing its fixed costs and increasing its operating margins 
in  the company reassessed the development process in its us toys segment  moving a greater amount of product development outside of the us  resulting in a streamlining of its us toy workforce 
in  the company ceased manufacturing in its valencia  spain facility and announced the closure of the remaining retail stores operated under the wizards of the coast and gamekeeper names 
the company will continue to review its operations in order to determine areas where greater efficiency can be achieved 
the company s recent strategy also focused on the reduction of long term debt 
the goal of management has been to reduce the company s debt to capitalization ratio  defined as total debt  both short term and long term  as a percentage of total equity plus total debt  to 
the company has repurchased or repaid  and  in principal amount of long term debt during and  respectively 
the repurchases included amounts related to a tender offer  pursuant to which the company repurchased  of aggregate principal amount of the notes due previously issued by the company 
at december   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was approximately  which compared to approximately at december  due to the seasonal nature of the business  the company s debt to capitalization ratio normally peaks at the end of the third quarter  when its working capital requirements are greatest 
the september  ratio was approximately 
it is the company s intent to continue to assess the desirability of using available cash from operations to reduce its outstanding long term debt and to maintain this target ratio  as market conditions and the company s committed revolving credit agreement and other sources of financing allow 
consolidation in the toy and game industry and associated retail uncertainty continued in  and included the pending reorganization of the company s second largest customer  toys r us 
as a result  the company s remaining customer base continued to become more concentrated 
the company s top five customers accounted for approximately of full year net revenues in  with wal mart stores  inc  toys r us  inc 
and target corporation  its three largest customers  accounting for 
the consolidation of customers may provide certain benefits to the company  such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution  including potential efficiencies related to sku reductions 
however  this consolidation also creates additional risks to the company s business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with the company 
in addition  increased customer concentration may decrease the prices the company is able to obtain for some of its products 
the company believes that its strategy of seeking to produce sought after products  which provide value to both consumers and the company s customers  will help protect the company from any negative impact resulting from an environment of increasing retail consolidation

the company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory  attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence 
the company s failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items  which could result in higher obsolescence costs  causing a reduction in gross profit 
the company expects a positive impact to gross margin in due to increased product revenue in connection with the anticipated release of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith

higher development costs associated with electronic toys such as videonow color and electronic games such as mission paint ball  plug and play  and dvd games contributed to this increased expense in the decrease in research and product development expenditures from  or of net revenues in to levels was primarily due to the timing of expenses related to development of certain product lines

in the fourth quarter of  as noted above  the company repurchased  in principal amount of notes due  in conjunction with a tender offer 
the remaining decrease in interest expense from to and decrease from to is due to lower effective interest rates  primarily the result of interest rate swap agreements that reduce the amount of the company s debt subject to fixed interest rates

these warrants are required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings 
the fair value of these warrants is primarily affected by the company s stock price  but is also affected by the company s stock price volatility and dividends  as well as risk free interest rates 
assuming the company s stock volatility and dividend payments  as well as risk free interest rates remain constant  the fair value of the warrants would increase and the company would recognize a charge to earnings as the price of the company s stock increases 
if the price of the company s stock decreases and the company s stock volatility  dividend payments  and the risk free interest rates remain constant  the fair value of the warrants will decrease and the company will recognize income 
based on a hypothetical increase in the company s stock price to per share at december  from its actual price of a share on that date  the company would have recognized non cash income of approximately  rather than actual non cash income recorded of  for the year ended december   to reflect the change in the fair value of the warrants from their fair value of  at december  other expense  net in also includes a  write down of the value of the common stock of infogrames  held by the company as an available for sale investment

it then compared the carrying values of its reporting units to the fair values of those reporting units 
the fair values of the reporting units were calculated using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
these values were compared in total with the fair value of the business based on market capitalization at the date of testing 
based on the result of this assessment  the company recorded a one time transitional charge of  net of related tax impact of  resulting from the impairment of goodwill relating to the us toys reporting unit primarily as the result of the change in goodwill impairment criteria from an undiscounted to a discounted cash flow method

during  the company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through operations and  when needed  using proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its available lines of credit 
the company believes that the funds available to it  including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its securitization program and other available lines of credit  are adequate to meet its needs for however  unforeseen circumstances in the toy or game industry  such as softness in the retail environment or unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  could result in a significant decline in revenues and operating results for the company  which could result in the company being in non compliance with its debt covenants and unable to use funding from its receivable securitization program 
non compliance with its debt covenants could result in the company being unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other bank lines  a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable the company to continue to fund its operations 
also  non compliance with covenants under its accounts receivable securitization program could result in the company being unable to utilize this program 
in addition  a significant deterioration in the business of a major us customer could result in a decrease in eligible accounts receivable that would prevent the company from being able to fully utilize its receivable securitization program 
during the last four fiscal years  as part of its strategy of reducing long term debt and its overall debt to capitalization ratio  the company has been able to repurchase or repay approximately  in principal amount of long term debt  primarily using cash from operations

the decrease in cash flows  despite an increase in earnings before cumulative effect of an accounting change  in from was primarily the result of non cash expenditures in  including utilization of prepaid expenses related to star wars royalties  and increased amortization expense in  primarily star wars related 
net cash provided by operating activities in also included a  royalty advance payment  which was recorded as a long term asset 
cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by the company s cost reduction initiatives in   and  resulting in a lower level of fixed operating expenses

this payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made 
with respect to the star wars license  the company has prepaid royalties recorded in both current and non current assets 
in periods prior to a major release  amounts will be reclassified from non current to current in anticipation of higher sales during the periods surrounding the release 
the increase in prepaid expenses to  at december  from  at december  was primarily the result of increased deferred and other taxes as well as deposits  which were partially offset by lower prepaid royalties from related to the star wars license 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to  at december  from  at december  the decrease primarily relates to decreases in accrued bonuses and performance incentives as well as a decrease in accrued income taxes 
to a lesser extent  this decrease was also due to a decrease in the value of certain warrants that the company is required to record as liabilities under sfas as a result of sfas  the company classifies certain warrants containing a put option as a current liability and adjusts the amount of this liability to its fair value on a periodic basis

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include sales allowances  inventory valuation  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions 
sales allowances for customer promotions  discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  the company will perform an interim test at that time 
the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units 
goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach 
the company s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was indicated 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge

the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
at december   the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of  recorded on the balance sheet 
intangible assets  other than those with indefinite lives  are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
intangible assets covered under this policy were  at december  during  there were no significant impairment charges related to these intangible assets 
the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product 
if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or  if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments  a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required 
the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties

based on this information  the company s estimate of expected return on plan assets was in and  and in a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense  while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately  expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical compensation increases with expected compensation increases in the company s long term business forecasts 
based on this analysis  the company s estimate of expected long term compensation increases was in and  and in increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense 
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the company considers moody s long term aa corporate bond yield at the measurement date as an appropriate guide in setting this rate 
based on the moody s long term corporate bond yield at september   the company s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities  the company selected a discount rate of 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the company s discount rate would increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately  and  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if outside a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods

to manage this exposure  the company has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts  and purchased foreign currency options 
the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company believes  however  that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition 
in addition  the company s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
from time to time  affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency 
the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 
other than as set forth above  the company does not hedge foreign currency exposures 
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts

at december   these contracts had a fair value of  with  included in other assets  and the other included in prepaid expenses and other current assets  with corresponding fair value adjustments to increase long term debt and current portions of long term debt  respectively

the economy and inflation the company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during the principal market for the company s products is the retail sector 
revenues from the company s top customers  all retailers  accounted for approximately of its consolidated net revenues in  and of its consolidated net revenues in and in the past two years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty 
the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 
the company s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year  and within that half  the fourth quarter  to be more significant to its overall business for the full year 
the company expects that this concentration will continue  particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year 
the concentration of sales in the second half of the year and  specifically  the fourth quarter increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items  b overproduction of less popular items  and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules 
the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line  product availability  marketing strategies  inventory levels  policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions 
the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season  which includes christmas 
quick response inventory management practices now being used result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment 
to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated  their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed  thus negatively impacting the company s revenues 
in addition  the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company s significant retailers could negatively impact the company s future revenues 
the effect of inflation on the company s operations during was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices  accordingly
