item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  for information on the composition of bankunited s loan portfolio by type of loan  including mortgage loans held for sale  at the end of each of the five past fiscal years  and for information on asset quality 
one to four family residential mortgage lending 
bankunited offers an extensive array of residential mortgage products and originates loans for both the bank s loan portfolio and for sale or securitization in the secondary market to governmental sponsored entities or other investors 
bankunited originates loans through its locations including full service banking offices located in florida  three loan production offices in florida  and four loan production offices located in other states 
the distribution channels used by bankunited to originate loans include a network of mortgage brokers  internal retail loan originators  and our sales force at each of our banking and loan production offices 
these distribution channels allow bankunited to generate high levels of loan volume as well as to offer additional products and services to loan customers through its retail banking offices 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  interest income generated from one to four family residential loans  including amortization of fees and premiums  represented   and  respectively  of total interest income and fees on loans 
bankunited s first mortgage loans generally have contractual maturities of between and years 
however  residential loans typically remain outstanding for shorter periods than their contractual maturities because borrowers prepay the loans in full upon sale of the mortgaged property or upon refinancing of the original loan 
our specialty consumer mortgage loans offer our customers the convenience of an accelerated application  review and approval process 
these loans have contractual terms of up to years  with the majority having year maturities  and also tend to prepay at a much faster rate than their contractual maturities 
bankunited originates both fixed and adjustable rate arms one to four family loans typically secured by first mortgages on the borrower s primary or secondary residence 
bankunited s arms generally have interest rates that adjust after an initial fixed rate period 
growth in loans during the past months has been centered in bankunited s mortgage loan product indexed to the monthly treasury average mta 
the mta index is the twelve month average of the monthly average yields on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year 
most of the mta loans originated by bankunited provide borrowers with payment options which could change the amount of interest collected on a monthly basis one month mta 
these payment options have the potential to result in negative amortization  which may increase the principal balance of loans up to a maximum limit of of the original loan at which time the loans are amortized over their remaining lives resulting in higher payments 
in addition  the twelve month look back period and averaging nature of mta index results in a slower reaction to changes in short term interest rates on assets indexed to the mta than on liabilities priced at the short term market rates 
this lag  combined with fluctuations in interest earned when borrowers exercise their payment options  can produce volatility in the net interest margin 
in a rising interest rate environment  the lagging effect tends to reduce the net interest margin with improvement in the margin occurring as short term interest rates level off or decline 
the magnitude of the impact of lag on margin is a function of the size of the interest rate movement and frequency of change  while the timing of the lag is driven by the averaging of the index over a twelve month period 
bankunited s mta portfolio average loan to value ratio is and the average fico score is over

as of september   one month mta loans with a balance of million were negatively amortizing with approximately thousand of their principal balances resulting from negative amortization 
these loans are subject to interest rate caps 
excluding deferred costs  discounts  premiums and allowance for loan losses 
consumer lending 
consumer loans are originated through our branch network in the form of home equity loans and lines of credit  and to a lesser extent  automobile  boat  and cash collateral loans 
home equity lines of credit are made with adjustable rates indexed to the prime rate  and generally have maturities of ten years or less 
home equity loans are fixed rate loans with maturities up to years 
automobile  boat  and cash collateral loans are offered on a fixed rate basis 
commercial real estate and multi family lending 
bankunited originates and participates in commercial real estate loans  and to a lesser degree  multi family loans  which may have fixed or variable interest rates 
bankunited s commercial real estate strategy is to increase originations by developing long term relationships with businesses  real estate developers  investors  and other professionals in the real estate market 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans secured by apartment buildings  office buildings  industrial warehouses  retail centers and other properties located primarily in bankunited s market area 
real estate construction lending 
bankunited makes real estate construction loans to builders and real estate developers for the construction of commercial and single and multi family real estate 
these loans are primarily secured by single family homes  condominiums  apartments  retail centers  commercial warehouse properties  office buildings  medical facilities or other property 
the loans generally provide for the payment of interest and loan fees from loan proceeds and are underwritten to the same standards as commercial real estate loans 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the market for the project upon completion  it is often difficult to determine the total loan funds that will be required to complete a project  the related loan to value ratios and the likelihood of a project s ultimate success 
bankunited is sensitive to trends that may increase risk for certain projects and takes precautionary measures when considering loans related to condominium developments in certain segments of the florida market 
land 
bankunited makes land loans to individuals for the purchase of land for their residences  as well as to builders and real estate developers for the purchase of land slated for future development 
the bank generally requires that the properties securing land loans be developed within to months and these loans generally have a lower loan to value ratio than other commercial real estate loans 
commercial lending 
bankunited makes and participates in both secured and unsecured commercial business loans to companies in its market area 
the strategy for commercial lending focuses on forming and maintaining customer relationships with primarily middle market companies doing business in florida  but also places significant attention on small businesses 
the majority of bankunited s commercial business loan portfolio is secured by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  and or general corporate assets of the borrowers  as well as the personal guarantee of the principal 
bankunited also makes and participates in loans originated by third parties 
commercial business loans may have fixed or variable interest rates and are typically originated for maturities ranging from one to five years 
commercial business loans are generally made for shorter maturities and may involve a higher level of risk because of the difficulty in liquidating the underlying collateral in the event of default 

table of contents mortgage loan servicing although bankunited originates loans primarily for its portfolio  it also sells a portion of the mortgage loans that it originates and may retain the right to service those loans 
mortgage servicing rights msr arise from contractual agreements between bankunited and investors in mortgage securities and mortgage loans 
under these contracts  bankunited performs loan servicing functions in exchange for fees and other remuneration 
bankunited recognizes msr as assets upon the sale of loans that continue to be serviced by bankunited 
the value of msr assets is derived from future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees  late charges  and other ancillary revenues that are expected to be more than adequate compensation to cover the costs associated with performing the service  and generally expressed as a percent of the unpaid principal balance 
the servicing functions typically performed include collecting and remitting loan payments  responding to borrower inquiries  accounting for principal and interest  holding custodial funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums  and generally administering the loans 
the servicing fees paid to bankunited are collected from the monthly payments made by the mortgagors 
in addition to fees paid for servicing the loans  bankunited receives other ancillary fees such as late charges  and prepayment penalties 
bankunited is subject to certain costs and risks related to servicing delinquent loans 
servicing agreements may require bankunited to advance funds to make scheduled payments of interest  taxes and insurance  and in some instances principal  even if such payments have not been received from the borrowers 
as a servicing entity  bankunited generally recovers substantially all of the advanced funds upon cure of default by the borrower  or through foreclosure proceedings and claims against agencies or companies that have insured or guaranteed the loans 
other agreements may require bankunited to remit funds to the loan purchaser only upon receipt of payments from the borrower and  accordingly  the investor bears the risk of loss 
at september   and  bankunited was servicing loans of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  for others 
as of september   and  bankunited had mortgage servicing rights with a carrying amount of million  million and million  respectively 
bankunited is subject to the risk that economic conditions may cause a revaluation of its servicing assets as borrowers refinance or otherwise prepay higher interest rate loans

fdic approval or notice may also be required for some activities 
the bank must file reports with the ots and is subject to periodic examination by the ots 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the bank is chartered by the ots  and is insured by the savings association insurance fund saif and the bank insurance fund bif 
deposits are insured up to  for each insured account holder  subject to applicable terms and conditions 
the fdic examines the bank and may terminate deposit insurance or impose sanctions if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices  cannot continue operations because it is in an unsafe and unsound condition  or has violated regulatory requirements 
the bank s management does not know of any present condition pursuant to which the fdic would seek to impose sanctions on the bank or terminate insurance of its deposits 
the fdic uses a risk based premium system that places all insured depository institutions into one of nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their level of capital and supervisory evaluation 
institutions which the fdic considers well capitalized and financially sound pay the lowest premiums  while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized and of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premiums 
the fdic is authorized to increase or decrease assessment rates on a semiannual basis  up to a maximum increase or decrease of basis points after aggregating all increases and decreases  if it determines that the reserve ratio will be less than the designated reserve ratio of of insured deposits 
the fdic may also impose special assessments on members to repay amounts borrowed from the united states treasury or for any other reason deemed necessary by the fdic 
during fiscal  assessment rates for insured institutions ranged from of insured deposits for well capitalized institutions with minor supervisory concerns to of insured deposits for undercapitalized institutions with substantial supervisory concerns 
fdic insured depository institutions must also pay an annual assessment for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico to finance the recapitalization of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the amount of the fico premium  which will continue until the bonds mature in  may be revised quarterly 
the fico assessment rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal was cents annually per of assessable deposits 
if the fdic were to significantly increase its assessment rates  such action could adversely affect the bank s earnings 
if the reserve ratio for the saif or the bif falls below the required level  the fund may re institute deposit insurance assessments for all institutions 
in addition to deposit insurance assessments  the fdic may collect assessments against insured deposits to service debt incurred in the s 
the assessment rate is adjusted quarterly 

table of contents regulatory capital requirements 
ots regulations incorporate a risk based capital requirement that is designed to be at least as stringent as the capital standard applicable to national banks and that is similar to fdic requirements 
associations whose exposure to interest rate risk is deemed to be above normal must deduct a portion of such exposure in calculating their risk based capital 
as of september   the bank exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements 
see note regulatory capital to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there are currently no regulatory capital requirements directly applicable to holding companies 
regulators have also established capital levels for institutions to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia 
insured institutions are categorized under the following levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
an institution s category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure  a leverage ratio capital measure  and certain other factors 
a well capitalized institution must have a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a ratio of capital to risk weighted assets tier risk based capital ratio of or more and a ratio of capital to adjusted total assets tier leverage ratio of or more  and may not be subject to any written agreement order capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive issued by the ots 
an institution will be categorized as adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  and either a tier leverage ratio of or more or a tier leverage ratio of or more  if the institution is assigned a composite rating of the composite rating is the numeric rating assigned by the ots under its rating system  as a result of the most recent ots examination 
any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized will be considered undercapitalized 
the ots would be required to take prompt corrective action to resolve the bank s situation if the bank failed to satisfy these minimum capital requirements 
at september   the bank was a well capitalized institution under the definitions as adopted 
risk based capital guidelines take into account various factors  including concentration of credit risk  risks associated with nontraditional activities  and the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multi family mortgages 
ots regulations include an interest rate risk component to the risk based capital requirements for savings associations such as the bank 
management monitors interest rate risk based on the ots s and bankunited s standards  and believes that the effect of including such an interest rate risk component in the calculation of risk adjusted capital will not cause the bank to cease being well capitalized 
the fdic also requires the ots to review its capital standards every two years to ensure that its standards require sufficient capital to facilitate prompt corrective action and to minimize loss to the saif and the bif 
restrictions on dividends and other capital distributions 
the bank must provide the ots with at least days written notice before declaring any dividend or approving any capital distribution 
the ots may object to any distribution on safety and soundness grounds and prior approval  instead of notice  may be required in some cases

item a 
risk factors these are general risk factors affecting bankunited 
they are further described under item business and in management s discussion and analysis 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business operations 
any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in such cases  you may lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents if the interest payments on our deposits and borrowings increase relative to the interest we earn on our loans and investments  they may decrease our net interest income 
our profitability depends to a large extent on the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between income on interest earning assets such as mortgage loans and investment securities  and expense on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
we are affected by changes in general interest rate levels and by other economic factors beyond our control 
our net interest income may be reduced if i more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are declining or ii more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are rising 
changes in the difference between short and long term interest rates may also harm our business 
for example  short term deposits may be used to fund longer term loans 
when differences between short term and long term interest rates shrink or disappear  the spread between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly  decreasing our net interest income 
if market interest rates rise rapidly  interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans arm  thus reducing our net interest income because we will need to pay the higher rates on our deposits and borrowings while being limited on the repricing of these loans due to the interest rate caps 
certain arm loans reprice based on lagging interest rate indices 
the effect of this lag may also negatively affect our net interest income when general interest rates continue to rise periodically 
an increase in loan prepayments and on prepayment of loans underlying mortgage backed securities may adversely affect our profitability 
prepayment rates are affected by consumer behavior  conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
changes in prepayment rates are therefore difficult for us to predict 
we recognize our deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans by adjusting our interest income over the contractual life of the individual loans 
as prepayments occur  the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed accelerates 
the effect of the acceleration of deferred costs and premium amortization may be mitigated by prepayment penalties paid by the borrower when the loan is paid in full within a certain period of time which varies between loans 
if prepayment occurs after the period of time when the loan is subject to a prepayment penalty  the effect of the acceleration of premium and deferred cost amortization is no longer mitigated 
we recognize premiums we pay on mortgage backed security as an adjustment from interest income over the life of the security based on the rate of repayment of the securities 
acceleration of prepayments on the loans underlying a mortgage backed security shortens the life of the security  increases the rate at which premiums are expensed and further reduces interest income 
we may not be able to reinvest loan and security prepayments at rates comparable to the prepaid instrument particularly in period of declining interest rates 
changes in interest rates could have additional adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in interest rates could have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations  including  without limitation  by decreasing the value of our mortgage servicing rights or our derivative instruments 
the initial and ongoing valuation and amortization of mortgage servicing rights is significantly impacted by interest rates  prepayment experience and the credit performance of the underlying we are unable to predict changes in market interest rates which are affected by many factors beyond our control including inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  domestic and international events and changes in the united states and other financial markets 
our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates  but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates  as well as balance sheet growth  client loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables 
in an increasing rate environment  our interest costs on liabilities may increase more rapidly than our income on interest earning assets 
this could result in a deterioration of our net interest margin 
changes in interest rates could also adversely affect our financial condition by reducing the value of our derivative instruments 
we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management activities to reduce risk associated with our borrowing activities 
our use of derivative instruments  however  exposes us to credit risk and market risk 
our credit risk is heightened when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  which generally means that a counterparty owes us 
we try to minimize credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties  but there can be no assurance that our financial evaluation of a counterparty will be accurate or that their financial status will not change 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of rates 
we manage market risk by establishing 
table of contents and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk undertaken 
change in interest rates may have either a positive or negative effect on the value of the derivative instrument depending on the nature of the derivative instrument 
we may be impacted by our concentration in arm loans indexed to the mta and with optional payment characteristics  generally referred to as option arm 
the majority of loans we currently originate and approximately half of our loan portfolio has optional payment characteristics 
these loans provide the consumer with several payment options each month and may result in monthly payments being lower than the amount of interest due on the loan 
any unpaid monthly interest is added to the loan balance and this result in negative amortization and an increasing loan balance 
these loans provide the consumer with the ability to reduce his initial loan payment and limit the amount of annual increase in the required monthly payment 
if a loan negatively amortizes in the initial years the consumer must make the payments up in the later years of the loan 
this presents a potential repayment risk if the consumer is unable to meet the higher payment or repay the loan through refinancing or sale of the underlying property 
we may periodically sell these loans in the secondary market 
a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
there are no current regulatory limitations on this type of loan products 
any regulatory limitation may affect the mortgage and residential real estate markets and limit our ability to grow our portfolio at the current pace 
we make loans to non resident aliens nras for the acquisition of secondary residences in the united states  primarily in the florida market 
changes in foreign exchange rates and political and economic conditions in the borrower s country of residence may affect his ability to make regular loan payments 
we make loans for the purchase of secondary residences to nras 
these loans are secured by property located in the united states  primarily in florida and generally carry a lower loan to value than loans to domestic residents 
these loans represent of our loan portfolio as of september  the value of the underlying property provides a source of liquidation in the united sates but the consumer s ability to make his monthly payments may be affected by factors such as the foreign exchange rates  capital outflow limitations and other political and economic risks associated with the country of residence 
bankunited limits its risk through its underwriting criteria on these loans 
changes in the united states laws and regulations affecting residents from those countries  could also adversely affect us if they result in a significant loss of deposits  increased loan defaults or a decreased market for our products 
an inadequate allowance for loan losses would reduce our earnings 
we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to assure full repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to meet our obligations under the notes 
volatility and deterioration in domestic and foreign economies may also increase our risk for credit losses 
our portfolio composition  with loans primarily secured by real estate  reduces loss exposure 
we evaluate the collectibility of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate based upon such factors as the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans  previous loan loss experience  specific loans that have loss potential  delinquency trends  estimated fair market value of the collateral  current economic conditions  the views of our regulators  and geographic and industry loan concentrations 
if our evaluation is incorrect and borrower defaults cause losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses  our earnings could be significantly and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that our allowance will be adequate to cover loan losses inherent in our portfolio 
we may experience losses in our loan portfolios or perceive adverse trends that require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses in the future  which would also reduce our earnings 
our exposure to credit risk is increased by our commercial real estate  commercial business and construction lending 
commercial real estate  commercial business and construction lending generally involve higher credit risk than single family residential lending 
such loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers 
commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or 
table of contents the economy because commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties  as well as the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers 
these loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period  but have a balloon payment due at maturity 
a borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction including interest and the availability of permanent take out financing 
during the construction phase  a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns 
if our estimate of value is inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates  the value of the property securing our loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral 
commercial business loans are typically based on the borrowers ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses 
such loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself 
in addition  the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time  be difficult to appraise and liquidate and fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
commercial real estate  commercial business and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle 
the underwriting  review and monitoring performed by our officers and directors cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans 
negative events in certain geographic areas could adversely affect us 
negative conditions in the real estate markets where collateral for our mortgage loans is located could adversely affect our borrower s ability to repay and the value of the collateral 
real estate values are affected by various factors  including changes in general or regional economic conditions  governmental rules or policies and natural disasters such as hurricanes 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
the banking and financial services industry is very competitive 
legal and regulatory developments have made it easier for new and sometimes unregulated competitors to compete with us 
consolidation among financial service providers has resulted in fewer very large national and regional banking and financial institutions holding a large accumulation of assets 
these institutions generally have significantly greater resources  a wider geographic presence or greater accessibility 
our competitors sometimes are also able to offer more services  more favorable pricing or greater customer convenience than we do 
in addition  our competition has grown from new banks and other financial services providers that target our existing or potential customers 
as consolidation continues among large banks  we expect additional smaller institutions to try to exploit our market 
technological developments have allowed competitors including some non depository institutions  to compete more effectively in local markets and have expanded the range of financial products  services and capital available to our target customers 
if we are unable to implement  maintain and use such technologies effectively  we may not be able to offer products or achieve cost efficiencies necessary to compete in our industry 
in addition  some of these competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures 
failure to pay interest on our debt may adversely impact us 
deferral of interest payments where allowed on our trust preferred securities  junior subordinated notes and senior notes may affect our ability to raise additional debt and pay dividends on our common stock 
failure to pay interest on other borrowings would adversely affect our ability to continue operations 
we rely heavily on the proper functioning of our technology 
we rely on our computer systems  and outside servicers providing technology  for much of our business  including recording our assets and liabilities 
if our computer systems or outside technology sources fail  are not reliable or there is a breach of security  our ability to maintain accurate financial records may be impaired  which could materially affect our operations and financial condition 
we are dependent upon the services of our management team 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key management personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the financial services industry and the markets in which we offer our services 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or key managers would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage and retain other qualified middle management personnel as we grow 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel 
terrorist activities could cause reductions in investor confidence and substantial volatility in real estate and securities markets 
it is impossible to predict the extent to which terrorist activities may occur in the united states or other regions  or their effect on a 
table of contents particular security issue 
it is also uncertain what effects any past or future terrorist activities and or any consequent actions on the part of the united states government and others will have on the united states and world financial markets  local  regional and national economics  and real estate markets across the united states 
among other things  reduced investor confidence could result in substantial volatility in securities markets  a decline in general economic conditions and real estate related investments and an increase in loan defaults 
such unexpected losses and events could materially affect our results of operations 
tourism and the travel industry are important factors to the general economy of our target market  which could be adversely affected by terrorism 
we may need additional capital resources in the future and these capital resources may not be available when needed or at all 
we may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments or for future growth 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we are subject to extensive regulation that could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business and limit our ability to receive dividends from the bank 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision ots as its primary federal regulator  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  which insures its deposits 
as a member of the fhlb  the bank must also comply with applicable regulations of the federal housing finance board and the fhlb 
regulation by these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our stockholders 
the bank s activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to our lending  deposit and other activities 
a sufficient claim against us under these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results 
changes in the regulation of financial services companies and housing government sponsored enterprises could adversely affect our business 
proposals for further regulation of the financial services industry are continually being introduced in congress 
the agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their regulations 
proposals that are now receiving a great deal of attention include regulation of government sponsored entities 
it is possible that one or more legislative proposals may be adopted or regulatory changes may be made that would have an adverse effect on our business 
negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings 
reputational risk is the risk to our operations from negative public opinion 
negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities  including our sales practices  including practices in our origination and servicing operations and retail banking operations  our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues  and our protection of confidential customer information 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and can expose us to litigation 
provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws and florida law could impede efforts to remove management and frustrate takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest more difficult  even if such events appear to benefit stockholders 
certain provisions of state and federal law may also discourage or prohibit a future takeover attempt in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices 
the voting power of the directors  executive officers and holders of or more of our equity securities and certain provisions of our articles of incorporation may discourage any proposed takeover not approved by our board of directors 
our insiders hold voting rights that give them significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors and executive officers hold substantial amounts of our class a common stock  class b common stock and series b preferred stock 
each share of class a common sock is entitled to one tenth vote  each share of class b common stock is entitled to one vote  and each share of series b preferred stock is entitled to two and one half votes 
for a more detailed description of our capital stock see  description of capital stock 
these classes generally vote together on matters presented to stockholders for approval 
consequently  other stockholders ability to influence our actions through their vote may be limited and the non insider stockholders may not have sufficient voting power to approve a change in control even if a significant premium is being offered for their shares 
there are several business and family relationships among directors that could create conflicts of interest 
several of our directors have business relationships with us and each other as disclosed in note related party transactions in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have opted out of the florida statute which would require the approval of either disinterested directors or a super majority vote of disinterested stockholders in the event of a certain affiliate transactions 
business and family relationships among us  our directors and officers may create conflicts of interest which are reviewed and addressed by our board of directors 
we cannot assure you that your interests will coincide with those of our officers and directors

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis and the related financial data present a review of the consolidated financial condition and operating results of bankunited for the periods presented 
this discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of bankunited  and is intended to supplement  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview bankunited s results of operations are dependent primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its assets  primarily its loan and securities portfolios  and its cost of funds  which consists of the interest paid on its deposits and borrowings 
bankunited s results of operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses as well as non interest income  non interest expenses and income tax expense 
non interest expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment  insurance  professional fees  telecommunications and data processing  loan servicing expense  and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and asset quality of bankunited s loans and investments 

table of contents in addition to the foregoing  results of bankunited s operations  like those of other financial institution holding companies  are affected by bankunited s asset and liability management policies  as well as factors beyond bankunited s control  such as general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
lending activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and other types of loans  and are thus influenced by interest rates and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing investments and by general market rates of interest 
in evaluating bankunited s financial condition and operating performance  management focuses on increasing loan originations to residential mortgage  commercial and commercial real estate customers  increasing total and core deposit balances  improving bankunited s net interest margin  maintaining higher credit standards  low levels of non performing assets and adequate loan loss reserves  managing interest rate risk  controlling expenses  and ensuring adequate funding for ongoing growth 
based on these factors  highlights for bankunited s fiscal year include loan production for improved by compared to  to reach billion 
total assets reached billion  a increase over the prior year 
total loans  net increased to billion  up over last year 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets of  down from at september th last year 
total deposits increased in by to billion 
core deposits increased in by to billion 
non interest bearing deposits increased by to million as of september  bankunited extinguished million of long term fhlb advances resulting in an after tax charge to earnings of million 
bankunited sold million of loans and accrued interest for securitization and acquired million of securities issued 
commenced operations in two new market areas  st 
lucie  and lee counties of florida 
eleven new branches were opened 
stockholders received dividends on class a common stock 
critical accounting policies bankunited s financial position and results of operations are impacted by management s application of accounting policies involving judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets 
in implementing its policies  management must make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently less than certain 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which could materially affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  income and expenses 
for a detailed discussion of bankunited s significant accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most critical accounting policies applied by bankunited are those that relate to the allowance for loan losses for portfolio loans  the carrying amount of loans held for sale  and the carrying amount of msr assets 
estimates of the amount of the allowance for portfolio loan losses  and the valuation of loans held for sale both affect the carrying amount of bankunited s loans 
the allowance for loan losses is a subjective judgment that management must make regarding the loan portfolio  and is established and maintained at levels that management believes are adequate to cover probable losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are made by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan administration and resolution  the views of regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  and peer group information 
in addition  the economic climate and direction  increases or decreases in overall lending rates  political conditions  legislation directly or indirectly impacting the banking industry  and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas in which bankunited conducts business are all considered 
where there is a question as to the impairment of a specific loan  management obtains valuations of the property or collateral securing the loan  and current financial information of the borrower  including financial statements  when available

liquidity and capital resources bankunited s liquidity management is the process of allocating assets and structuring liabilities to provide sufficient cash or cash equivalents to meet its daily operating needs on an ongoing basis 
it is bankunited s policy to manage its funds so that there is no need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions 
sources of liquidity include deposit growth  fhlb advances  other borrowings  federal reserve borrowings  loan repayments  investment portfolio run off  liquidation of investments and mortgage backed securities  overnight and term repurchase agreements  and cash and cash equivalents 
from time to time  bankunited utilizes its access to capital markets and may raise capital through equity and debt offerings 
bankunited has also utilized trust preferred and subordinated debt issuances to provide a source of capital for the bank 
bankunited believes it can raise additional capital by providing an adequate return to shareholders 
bankunited s objective in managing liquidity is to maintain sufficient resources of available cash to address both short and long term business funding needs such as loan demand  investment purchases  deposit fluctuations  and debt service requirements 
in doing so  bankunited maintains an overall liquidity position that has an aggregate amount of readily accessible and marketable assets  cash flow and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected deposit outflows and or increases in loan demand 
cash levels are minimized to levels required by regulation and necessary to meet the projected anticipated needs for business operations 
bankunited is not aware of any events or uncertainties which may impede liquidity in the short or long term 
bankunited utilizes deposits originated through its network of retail branches as a source of funds 
we currently offer savings  checking  and money market accounts and certificate accounts with varying maturities 
deposits represent one of bankunited s primary source of funds 
for information on deposits  see note deposits to the notes to consolidated financial statement 
borrowings a substantial portion of bankunited s balance sheet growth has been funded by short term and long term borrowings 
short term borrowings are due within one year  long term borrowings are due in one year or more 
in addition to borrowings available as a member of the fhlb of atlanta  bankunited utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  subordinated notes  and trust preferred securities as sources of borrowings 
the fhlb of atlanta offers a wide variety of borrowing plans to member financial institutions with fixed  variable  or convertible rates 
borrowings from the fhlb  known as advances  are secured by a member s share of stock in the fhlb  that are required to be purchased in proportion to outstanding advances  and by certain types of mortgages and other eligible collateral 
the terms and rates charged for fhlb advances vary in response to general economic conditions 
the fhlb of atlanta will consider various factors  including an institution s regulatory capital position  net income  quality and composition of assets  lending policies and practices  and level of current borrowings from all sources  in determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution 
in addition  an institution that fails to meet the qualified thrift lender test may have restrictions imposed on its ability to obtain fhlb advances 
the bank currently meets the qualified thrift lender test 
as of september   bankunited had billion of fhlb advances outstanding  including approximately million maturing within days and billion maturing within one year 
advances outstanding as of september  were secured by loans with a carrying value of approximately billion 
approximately billion  million  and million of the advances outstanding as of september  were fixed  variable  and convertible  respectively 
the fhlb convertible advance programs permit the fhlb to call an advance or to change the rate structure at the call date 
convertible advances generally fall under one of two programs  one with a single specified call date after which the rate changes to a floating rate and the other with a specified initial call date that resets every ninety days thereafter 
specific call features vary on each advance including bankunited s ability to prepay the advance 
the next call date on current advances ranges from three months to four years

table of contents interest income 
total interest income increased by million  for the year ended september   compared to the same period in this improvement was generated mostly by an increase of billion in average portfolio loans outstanding during fiscal compared to increasing interest income by million 
yields earned on loans increased by basis points year over year which also increased interest income by million 
the increase in interest income earned on loans also reflects a million increase in prepayment fees earned upon prepayment of mortgage loans by borrowers during the year compared to  which were previously reported in non interest income and reclassified into interest income 
these increases in interest income due from loans were offset by a reduction in the average balances of mortgage backed securities of million which reduced interest income by million 
in the fourth quarter of bankunited s fiscal year  the fhlb of atlanta reduced its rate of dividend payout 
this reduction affected the yield of bankunited s investment in fhlb stock 
the amount of fhlb stock required to be held by the bank at any point  is a function of bankunited s outstanding fhlb advances 
to the extent that the fhlb reduces its dividend on the stock  it will indirectly increase bankunited s effective cost of borrowing through the fhlb 
interest expense

in addition  the increase in the rates paid on these borrowings went up by basis points resulting in million of additional interest expense 
during the second half of fiscal  bankunited repositioned its balance sheet by prepaying million of fhlb advances  and settled related swaps 
bankunited anticipates a relative reduction in its costs of borrowings as a result of this repositioning 
the second largest increase in interest expense of million stemmed from the cost of certificates of deposit 
additional volumes of these deposits of million for the year ended september  compared to increased interest expense by million 
an increase in the rates paid on certificates of deposits of basis points increased interest expense by million 
in february  million in senior notes were repaid 
bankunited issued million of convertible senior notes during the same quarter of that year 
the interest rate on senior debt declined from for the year ended september  to for the same period in as a result  the combined volume and rate changes reduced senior note expense by million 
the remaining increases resulted mostly from higher rates paid on core deposits  and trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures  which resulted in million of additional interest expense 
the net interest margin decreased for the year ended september  to  down from for the same period in this decrease resulted primarily from the lagging effect on the re pricing of bankunited s adjustable rate mortgage loans and the rapid repricing of fhlb advances as short term interest rates and funding costs increased during the comparable periods 
approximately of bankunited s total loan portfolio as of september  consisted of adjustable rate mortgages indexed to the mta 
this index currently lags increases in short term interest rates

interest income 
interest income increased by million for the year ended september   compared to the same period in this net increase is the result of increases of million due to changes in volume of interest earning assets  offset by decreases of million due to changes in yield on those assets 
the volume related changes in interest income stem primarily from the increase in average loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities and fhlb stock  which increased interest income by million  million  and million  respectively  for the year ended september  compared to the yield related changes in interest income stem mostly from the decrease in yield on loans of basis points from for the year ended september  to for the same period in this drop in yield on loans reduced interest income by million for the year ended september  compared to the prior year

yields also dropped on mortgage backed securities  and fhlb stock reducing interest income by million and million  respectively  for the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million for the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
this net decrease is the result of increases of million due to changes in volume  offset by decreases of million due to an overall reduction in rates 
the majority of the volume related changes stem from the increase in average fhlb advances and repurchase agreements  which increased interest expense by million 
interest expense was increased to lesser extent by million  and million respectively  from increases in volume of savings accounts  and certificates of deposit during fiscal interest income was reduced during fiscal by million and million  respectively  from lower volumes of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures  and medium term notes 
the rate related changes stem from the decrease in rates paid in the aggregate on all liabilities  from for the year ended september  to for the most significant improvement came from a drop in rates paid on fhlb advances and other borrowings  which changed from for the year ended september  to for despite the higher rate convertible advances of million  with a weighted average coupon rate approaching  which  due to their structure are expected to remain outstanding for another four to five years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary bankunited invests in various types of interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities which are funded largely by interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  senior notes  and trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures 
none of these financial instruments are entered into for trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates that creates interest rate risk for the bank 
accordingly  bankunited s net interest income  the most significant component of its net income  is impacted by changes in market interest rates and yield curves  particularly if there are differences  or gaps  in the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and the interest bearing liabilities which fund them 
bankunited monitors such interest rate gaps and seeks to manage its interest rate risk by adjusting the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition to reviewing reports which summarize bankunited s various interest sensitivity gaps  management utilizes a simulation model which measures the financial impact certain interest rate scenarios are likely to have on the bank 
as discussed more fully below  a variety of factors influence the repricing characteristics and the market values of bankunited s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but many of these factors are difficult to quantify 
additionally  bankunited utilizes derivative financial instruments designed to reduce the interest rate risk associated with its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will contractually mature or reprice  or if by management assumption  it is likely to be impacted by prepayments  run off  early withdrawal  or other such forces which can impact the timing and amount of a given financial instrument s cash flows 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within that same period 
a gap is considered to be positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time frame 
conversely  a gap is considered to be negative when  within a given period of time  the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period where the general level of interest rates is rising  a bank with a negative gap over that period is likely to experience a decline in net interest income  while a bank with a positive gap will typically experience an increase in net interest income 
beginning in  bankunited shifted its lending activities towards adjustable rate mortgages  which primarily reprice monthly 
bankunited has funded this growth with liabilities that primarily reprice within six months or less 
significant assumptions utilized in managing interest rate risk assessing and managing bankunited s exposure to interest rate risk involves significant assumptions concerning the exercise of options which are considered to be embedded in many of the financial instruments on bankunited s balance sheet  the expected movement and relationship of various interest rate indices  the impact of lag and cap risk  and the general availability of mortgages 
embedded options 
as of september   a substantial portion of bankunited s loans and mortgage backed securities consist of mortgage loans that contain an embedded option allowing borrowers to repay all  or a portion of  their loan prior to maturity  frequently without penalty 
the existence of this embedded prepayment option can adversely impact bankunited s financial performance 
in general  fixed rate securities tend to exhibit an increase in market value when the level of interest rates falls  and they tend to exhibit a decrease in market value when the level of interest rates rises 
mortgage loans having embedded prepayment options  and the securities which contain them  tend to decrease in market value as interest rates rise 
however increases in market value due to a decrease in interest rates are typically suppressed since in a lower rate environment borrowers are more likely to prepay  or refinance  their mortgage loans 
consequently  the adverse impact an investment in mortgage loans or mortgage securities may have on bankunited s market value of equity  should interest rates rise  may exceed the beneficial impact should interest rates fall by a like amount 
additionally  in an increasing interest rate environment bankunited s funding costs may be expected to increase more quickly than would bankunited s earnings from its mortgage loan assets 
this could result in a deterioration in bankunited s net interest margin 
however  due to the asymmetry discussed previously  improvement in bankunited s net interest margin due to a general decrease in interest rates may be less than the deterioration in bankunited s net interest margin given a similar increase in the general level of interest rates 
we recognize our deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans by adjusting our interest income over the contractual life of the individual loans 
as prepayments occur  the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed accelerates 
a borrower s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which are the loan s current interest rate versus the rate at which the borrower would be able to refinance  the economic benefit expected to be obtained from refinancing  the borrower s financial ability to refinance  the availability of mortgage loans in general  and numerous other economic and non economic factors  some of which may vary by geographic region 
savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon customer request without prior notice 
however  on an overall basis  one customer s withdrawal is likely to be offset by another customer s deposit resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits are generally subject to early withdrawal penalties  which results in the large majority of these deposits being maintained until maturity 
similarly  term fhlb advances have prepayment penalties  which discourage early repayment by the bank 
bankunited s trust preferred securities may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest receivable after five years from the issuance date  except for securities issued by bankunited capital  which have a ten year call provision 
see note borrowings to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the trust preferred securities 

table of contents bankunited borrows from the fhlb in the form of advances to fund operations 
these advances have a variety of terms  rates and repayment provisions 
approximately million of advances outstanding as of september  have been obtained through a convertible advances program 
the fhlb convertible advance programs permit the fhlb to call an advance or to change the rate structure at the call date 
convertible advances generally fall under one of two programs  one with a single specified call date after which the rate changes to a floating rate and the other with a specified initial call date that resets every ninety days thereafter 
specific call features vary on each advance  including bankunited s ability to prepay the advance 
the next call date on current advances ranges from three months to four years 
if the fhlb elects to exercise their options under the convertible advance programs  bankunited s cost of funds may be affected adversely 
the convertible advances outstanding as of september  of million have a weighted average coupon rate of 
interest rate indices 
bankunited s arm loans and mortgage backed securities are primarily indexed to the one year constant maturity treasury cmt or monthly treasury average mta indices 
bankunited s commercial and consumer loans may be indexed to prime or libor 
to the extent such loans and mortgage backed securities are funded by deposits  fhlb advances  and other interest bearing liabilities whose interest costs are influenced by indices not highly correlated with the above indices  an environment of changing interest rates may impact the various indices differently which may lead to significant changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  bankunited s financial instruments 
historical relationships between various indices may not necessarily be indicative of future relationships 
lag risk 
lag risk results from timing differences between repricing of adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
the effect of this timing difference  or lag  would be favorable in a falling interest rate environment and negative during periods of rising interest rates 
this lag risk can produce short term volatility in the net interest margin during periods of interest rate movements even though over time the lag effect will balance out 
as an illustration we have loans indexed to the mta 
the mta index is the twelve month average of the monthly treasury constant maturity rates as published in the federal reserve statistical release 
loans may be delayed in repricing to current interest rate levels during a period of rapidly rising interest rates while liabilities generally reprice to current market interest rates more rapidly 
cap risk 
in times of sharply rising interest rates  caps may serve to limit the increase in interest income generated from certain interest earning assets 
conversely  in an environment of sharply falling interest rates  they may reduce the decline in bankunited s interest income 
over periods of time where the general level of interest rates has had time to fluctuate  the alternating positive and negative effects generated by such interest rate caps will be largely offsetting 
over shorter periods  however  and to the extent any caps are actually limiting the interest rate adjustment of any assets  they can increase the volatility of bankunited s net interest income  and to a lesser extent  its market value of equity 
availability of mortgage loans 
the availability of mortgage loans meeting bankunited s criteria is dependent upon  among other things  the size and level of activity in the residential real estate lending market  which in turn depends on other factors including the level of interest rates  regional and national economic conditions and changes in residential real estate values 
to the extent that bankunited is unable to originate or acquire a sufficient volume of mortgage loans meeting its criteria  bankunited s operating results could be adversely affected 
in originating or acquiring mortgage loans  bankunited competes with reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  competing lenders  fnma  fhlmc  gnma  and other entities which purchase mortgage loans  some of which have greater financial resources than bankunited 
increased competition for the origination or acquisition of eligible mortgage loans or a diminution in the supply could result in bankunited having to incur higher costs and accept lower yields 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount by which bankunited s yield on earning assets would exceeds its cost of funding those assets 
the following table sets forth the re pricing gap between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities expected to mature or re price within the same period of time 
this gap analysis is a static view as of september  the analysis reflects assumptions made as to the prepayment of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
assumptions are also made as to the re pricing period of deposits that have no stated maturity and are not contractually subject to re pricing except as determined by bankunited 
other interest bearing assets and liabilities have been scheduled to re price based on the earlier contractual re pricing or final maturity date of the contract 
assumptions as to the prepayment of mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans are based upon expected prepayment speeds and an analysis of current market conditions 
money market  savings and transaction accounts are assumed to re price based upon deposit decay estimates determined by bankunited 
pricing of these deposits is determined by bankunited based upon market conditions and other factors 
the conditions and assumptions utilized in this analysis may not be appropriate at another point in time 
consequently  the interpretation of this information is highly subjective

table of contents in addition to preparing and reviewing periodic gap reports which help identify repricing mismatches  bankunited uses simulation models which estimate the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics based on bankunited s expectations for the next months 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by senior management 
based on the information and assumptions in effect on september   management estimates the impact  on net interest income  of a gradual and parallel basis point rise or fall in interest rates over the next months to be a decrease of or an increase of  respectively 
bankunited recognizes that there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with the simulations described above which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the simulation model assumes that the composition of bankunited s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains relatively constant over the period being measured and also assumes that the change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are highly subjective in nature  involve uncertainties and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the simulation model may provide an indication of bankunited s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to provide for a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on bankunited s net interest income and may often differ from actual results 
bankunited s operations are affected by many factors beyond its control such as the overall condition of the economy  monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and regulations specific to the banking industry 
revenues generated from lending activities are impacted by loan demand  which in turn impacts the interest rates at which such loans may be made  the supply of housing  the availability of funds to lend  and the cost of obtaining such funds 
derivative and hedging activities 
bankunited uses derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management activities to reduce risks associated with its borrowing activities 
derivatives used for interest rate risk management include various interest rate swaps and caps that relate to the pricing of specific on balance sheet instruments and forecasted transactions 
in connection with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition and report them at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in either earnings or in other comprehensive income  depending on the purpose for which the derivative is held and whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting 
bankunited has interest rate swap agreements that qualify as fair value hedges and those that qualify as cash flow hedges 
fair value hedges are used to hedge fixed rate debt 
bankunited uses cash flow hedges to hedge interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt 
in connection with its interest rate management activities  bankunited may use other derivatives as economic hedges of on balance sheet assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions which do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas accordingly  these derivatives are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with realized gains and losses included in earnings 
by using derivative instruments  bankunited is exposed to credit and market risk 
credit risk  which is the risk that a counterparty to a derivative instrument will fail to perform  is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
credit risk is created when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  since this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us 
when the fair value of a derivative is negative  no credit risk exists since bankunited would owe the counterparty 
bankunited minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties as evaluated by management 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of rates 
we manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the market risk associated with derivatives used for interest rate risk management activity is fully incorporated into our market risk sensitivity analysis
