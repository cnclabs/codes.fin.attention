item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to such consolidated financial statements also included in this form k 
some of the information that follows are not statements of historical fact but merely reflect our intent  belief or expectations regarding the anticipated effect of events  circumstances and trends 
such statements should be considered as forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations 
factors that might cause or contribute to differences between our expectations and actual results include uncertainty of market acceptance of our products by the worldwide medical community  our need to obtain third party reimbursement approval from additional government entities  managed care organizations  and private insurance plans  particularly outside the united states  risk that other companies may develop and market human papillomavirus hpv tests competitive with our own  our ability to scale up our manufacturing to the extent demand for our products increases  our limited sales and marketing experience  uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary rights in connection with our products and products in development  uncertainty to the outcome of patent litigation in which we are currently engaged  the extent of future expenditures for sales and marketing programs  delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our products in development  uncertainty of clinical trial results for our products in development  uncertainty of future profitability and cash generation from operations  our ability  if necessary  to obtain requisite additional financing to fund our operations beyond calendar  risks inherent in international transactions  including those relating to our expansion in europe and elsewhere  and other factors as set forth under the caption risk factors beginning on page overview since our incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing  manufacturing and marketing our proprietary gene based testing systems using our patented hybrid capture technology for the screening  monitoring and diagnosis of human diseases 
in prior years we incurred substantial operating losses  resulting principally from expenses associated with our research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory submissions for our products  the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and our global sales and marketing activities 
our revenues  to a significant extent  have been derived from the sales of our diagnostic tests for the presence of hpv  which accounted for of total revenues in fiscal we expect that the growing acceptance of hpv testing in cervical cancer screening programs  both in the united states and internationally  will continue to drive the growth in revenues from our hpv test products in the future 
in fiscal  our gross margin on product sales increased to as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  we believe that we will be able to sustain a gross margin of approximately 
we calculate gross margin as the difference between product sales and the cost of product sales  which excludes royalty and technology expense  as a percentage of product sales for the period 
we have in licensed patents to a number of cancer causing human papillomavirus types  biological materials and other intellectual property on which we pay royalties  patent maintenance and other technology access costs 
our total royalty and technology expenses are expected to be approximately to of product sales in fiscal our sales and marketing expenditures have been  and will continue to be  focused on accelerating the adoption of hpv testing worldwide 
we intend to capitalize on the expanded indications for use of our hpv test products and the growing acceptance of our hpv test products in the united states and internationally by physicians  laboratories and health insurance providers by materially increasing expenditures for sales and marketing programs over the next several quarters 
we have also significantly expanded our sales organization in the united states and increased our investment in physician detailing and direct to consumer promotion activities 
during fiscal one significant area of investment was in our european infrastructure and distribution operations  in which we expect to continue to invest in fiscal we expect to increase the size of our investment in research and development for the next several quarters and focus our research and development expenditures in the development of our next generation hybrid capture platforms and other research and development programs primarily related to hpv testing 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase to support the overall growth of our business 
on october   we executed a settlement and license agreement to settle the then pending patent litigation with enzo biochem  inc and its subsidiary enzo life sciences  inc formerly known as enzo diagnostics  inc collectively  enzo 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in patent litigation settlement expense in the quarter ended september  additionally  we will pay enzo royalties on future net sales of products covered by the license grant 
please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the enzo settlement 
on july   we entered into a settlement and license agreement with georgetown university georgetown to settle the then pending litigation 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the quarter ended june  we will also pay georgetown royalties on future net sales of products covered by the license grant 
please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the georgetown settlement 
although we anticipate increasing our expenditures as described above  we anticipate that factors such as the impact of our ability to sustain our gross margins will offset the impact such increased expenditures would have on our operating profits 
we expect to generate operating profits in fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that we will meet this goal 
results of operations fiscal change fiscal change fiscal in thousands total revenue product sales hpv test product revenue cost of product sales gross margin royalty and technology expense we calculate gross margin as the difference between product sales and the cost of product sales  which exclude royalty and technology expense  as a percentage of product sales for the period 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to a growth in sales of our hpv test products to approximately  an increase of in equipment sales  to approximately  also contributed to the increase in product sales 
the majority of the growth in our hpv test product revenue was in the united states  which increased to approximately  and in europe  which increased  to approximately  in the united states  most of the growth in our hpv test product sales was from increased acceptance of our digene hpv test also marketed as the dnawithpap test in the united states for adjunctive cervical cancer screening with a pap test for women age and older  an indication approved by the us food and drug administration fda in march we believe the continued growth was also due in part to our direct to consumer marketing campaign which began in fiscal the increase in revenues from equipment sales primarily related to sales of our rapid capture system following the may fda approval of the use of such automated system to perform our diagnostic tests 
the growth in product sales in europe related to the success of our subsidiary operating companies and distributor operations benefiting from our coordinated sales and marketing programs  public awareness campaigns and government education efforts 
the net impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on product sales was immaterial for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
other revenues primarily include research and development contract revenues  equipment rental revenues and licensing revenues 
other revenues increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in other revenues in fiscal is largely due to a increase in research and development contract revenues to approximately  and a increase in miscellaneous revenue to  which consists primarily of extended warranty revenue 
cost of product sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased product sales volume 
gross margins on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal was the result of a shift in product mix from lower margin products to higher margin hpv test products 
this increase in gross margin percentage due to product mix changes was partially offset by increased manufacturing overhead costs 
royalty and technology expense increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased royalty expenses  effective october   on net sales of our products based on a settlement and license agreement with enzo  under which we pay enzo royalties on net sales of products covered by the license grant 
the increase is also due to a charge of  accrued during the quarter ended september  relating to a non exclusive license to institut pasteur s intellectual property concerning the hepatitis b virus genome and the reversal of approximately  of accrual during the prior fiscal year based on the expectation that a specific royalty accrual would not materialize 
please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the enzo settlement 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenditures was due primarily to a increase in personnel costs to approximately  an increase in professional services of to approximately  and an increase in license fees to  the increase in professional services was due largely to costs paid to a vendor for development of a sample preparation workstation  clinical evaluations for processing liquid based cytology  and costs incurred for the preparation of compliance with the european union in vitro diagnostic directive regulations for our rapid capture system and related accessories  for which compliance was obtained in the last quarter of fiscal the majority of the license fees relate to a supply and license agreement we entered into in fiscal to develop certain next generation products 
our research and development activities focus on our platform technology  including substantial modifications of the design or capabilities of our products and equipment offerings 
because our research and development expenditures tend to benefit multiple product offerings  we do not track and maintain research and development expenses on a per product or per disease target basis 
in fiscal our research and development activities focused on our platform technology  including adaptations of such technology  and improvements to our diagnostic test and equipment products 
we focused our research and development activities in four areas core research efforts for next generation technologies  new product development activities  support and improvement of existing product lines and equipment offerings  and support of regulatory submissions to seek approvals to market our existing products for additional uses and indications in the us and abroad 
our core research efforts for next generation technologies include research programs for improved molecular diagnostic assay systems for detection of hpv and other targets of interest in the area of women s cancers and infectious diseases  and research on our next generation of hybrid capture technology 
we completed initial technical feasibility of our proprietary next generation dna test platform for ultra sensitive detection of dna targets in a multiplexed format and we are conducting further evaluations to confirm the applicability of the new method and are entering the product development stage 
we are working on products that will enable hpv genotyping  and have two products in the development pipeline 
we continue our collaborative product development and commercialization agreement with path program for appropriate technology in health to develop a rapid  batch hpv test for resource constrained countries and have entered the second year of that program 
digene and path jointly fund the efforts subject to certain maximum funding obligations and digene performs the product development and commercialization activities 
product development activities are currently focused on improving and simplifying cervical specimen processing procedures and increasing hybrid capture assay throughput  including a new batch preparation method for processing liquid based cytology specimens for hybrid capture testing 
in support of this new method  we are conducting a multi center clinical evaluation specifically for the processing of cervical specimens collected in thinprep preservcyt tm solution cytyc corporation 
the results of this study will support a pre market approval supplement pma supplement for the hybrid capture testing of preservcyt solution specimens processed in this manner and is expected to lead to a fda submission in fiscal this processing method is expected to become part of a more comprehensive clinical sample preparation workstation also in development  which is being designed to automate the front end processing of all clinical specimen types for hpv  chlamydia ct  and gonorrhea gc testing  including specimens collected in our specimen transport media stm 
this sample preparation workstation is intended to provide a streamlined means to prepare samples for transfer to the rapid capture system 
we have also begun validation of the next version of digene microplate luminometer software  which is expected to provide new features and improvements in the data acquisition and result reporting capabilities from our luminometer 
we are continuing efforts to expand hpv testing capabilities for additional liquid based cytology media  including the surepath tm collection and preservative medium tripath imaging 
the regulatory work required to obtain fda approval for use of surepath for hpv testing following tripath imaging s voluntary withdrawal of their pma supplement in february is ongoing as part of the continued collaboration between digene and tripath imaging 
regulatory work was also completed in late fiscal that enabled the rapid capture system and associated products to be sold in the european union 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  marketing program expenses  which increased to approximately  and facility and overhead costs  including travel  which increased to approximately  the increase in personnel costs is due largely to increasing the size of our physician detailing sales force for which we began hiring extensively in the middle of fiscal the increase in marketing program expenses is the result of a direct to consumer awareness campaign implemented during the quarter ended march  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in agency fees to approximately  for our physician detailing arrangement with pdi  inc pdi recruits and administers a digene specific physician education sales organization dedicated to educating physicians about the benefits of the digene hpv test in the united states 
geographically  the majority of the increase in our selling and marketing expenses for fiscal was incurred in the united states  which increased to approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal  as we expanded our direct sales and marketing activities  including our direct to consumer awareness campaign  in the united states to increase sales of our hpv test products 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  and an increase in facility and overhead costs to approximately  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional services  to approximately  the decrease in professional services is due largely to a decrease in legal fees  which decreased to approximately  partially offset by an increase in accounting fees  which increased to approximately  geographically  the majority of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal was incurred in the united states  which increased  to approximately  over the corresponding period in fiscal patent litigation settlements relate to the october settlement with enzo  for which  was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  as well as a charge of  recorded in the last quarter of fiscal based on a settlement and license agreement entered into with georgetown on july  please see liquidity and capital resources below for descriptions of the enzo and georgetown settlements 
interest income increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due to higher interest rates in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal  as well as higher average short term investment balances in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense decreased to approximately  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal primarily due to the reduction in our long term debt due to abbott laboratories as quarterly principal payments were made on an outstanding promissory note 
the promissory note was paid in full in september other expense was approximately  in fiscal and other income was approximately  in fiscal the balances in both periods are primarily based on foreign exchange rate fluctuations causing transaction gains and losses 
minority interest was approximately  in fiscal minority interest represents the digene do brasil ltda minority partner s share of the equity and earnings of the subsidiary 
the net income tax benefit of approximately  in fiscal was primarily related to the partial release of the valuation allowance previously established against our deferred tax assets 
we released approximately  of valuation reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal which was the estimated amount to be utilized in the foreseeable future 
based upon projected future operating performances  we believed  and despite fiscal operating losses still believe  that we will be able to utilize a portion of the value of our net operating loss nol carryforward against future taxable income 
accordingly  we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately  in fiscal however  we recognized approximately  of foreign operating losses before income tax from european operations during fiscal that did not generate an income tax benefit due to a full valuation allowance reported against foreign deferred tax assets  including additional deferred tax assets created by current year foreign tax losses 
as of june  and june   we had total us nol carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
we also had foreign nol carryforwards of approximately  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
for fiscal and  we have not reversed the portion of the valuation allowance related to the potential tax benefits from the exercise of stock options as realization of these benefits are not likely at this time and the amounts are expected to expire unused 
should realization of these benefits become more likely than not  the benefit will be reflected as a reclassification to stockholders equity 
further  we have not reversed any portion of the valuation allowance related to foreign nols  should realization of these benefits become more likely than not  the benefit will be reflected as an increase to consolidated statement of operations 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to a growth in sales of our hpv test products to approximately  and an increase in equipment sales of  to approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal the majority of the growth in our hpv test product revenue was in the united states  which increased to approximately  and in europe  which increased  to approximately  in the united states  most of the growth in our hpv test product sales related to the commercial launch of our digene hpv test for adjunctive cervical cancer screening with a pap test for women age and older  an indication approved by the fda in march the increase in revenues from equipment sales primarily related to sales of our rapid capture system following the may fda approval of the use of such automated system to perform our diagnostic tests 
the growth in product sales in europe related to the success of our subsidiary operating companies and distributor operations benefiting from our coordinated sales and marketing programs  public awareness campaigns and government education efforts 
other revenues included research and development contract revenues  equipment rental revenues and licensing revenues 
other revenues increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately  in research and development contract revenue 
cost of product sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased product sales volume 
gross margins on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal our gross margins in fiscal were impacted by costs of approximately  associated with a voluntary product recall in fiscal  costs of approximately  due to a fiscal increase in reserves in anticipation of planned product discontinuations in europe in december  other changes in our products offerings and charges of approximately  after insurance proceeds  for a freezer failure in september  which resulted in damaged inventory 
the fiscal gross margin also increased due to approximately  of manufacturing efficiencies related to production scale ups  product consolidations and process improvements implemented during fiscal these increases in gross margin were partially offset by increased sales of equipment  which have lower gross margins than our diagnostic test products 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenditures was due primarily to a increase in personnel costs to approximately  and a increase in laboratory supplies to approximately  partially offset by a decrease in professional services of to approximately  the decrease in professional services was due largely to decreased expenditures in fiscal  as compared to the costs incurred in fiscal  to obtain ce marking for our hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea diagnostic test products in accordance with the european union in vitro diagnostic directive  which ce marking was successfully accomplished in december our research and development activities focus on our platform technology  including substantial modifications of the design or capabilities of our products and equipment offerings 
because our research and development expenditures tend to benefit multiple product offerings  we do not track and maintain research and development expenses on a per product or per disease target basis 
in fiscal  we focused our research and development activities in four areas core research efforts for next generation technologies  new product development activities  completion of activities necessary to support regulatory submissions to seek approvals to market our existing products for additional uses and indications in the us and abroad  and modification of the design or capabilities of our product and equipment offerings 
our core research efforts for next generation technologies included research programs with the goal of developing improved molecular diagnostic assay systems for the detection of hpv and other targets of interest in the area of women s cancers and infectious diseases  and research on our next generation of hybrid capture technology 
during fiscal  our new product development activities focused on the discovery of innovative methods to improve specimen processing procedures and throughput to expand the ability of laboratories to use our diagnostic tests 
the activities included procedures for the improved processing of preservcyt cytyc corporation specimens and upgrades of our equipment offerings for high throughput hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea testing 
we also worked to expand hpv testing capabilities to allow testing from additional liquid cytology media  including our proprietary universal collection medium ucm  which is expected to allow simultaneous nucleic acid testing  protein analysis and cytological testing of human papillomavirus dna  chlamydia dna and gonorrhea dna  and of other genetic and cellular material from a single patient sample  and the surepath tripath imaging medium  for which the clinical validation is ongoing 
we also completed development of a software improvement for our rapid capture system to permit the simultaneous testing of multiple dna probes  and to improve the related laboratory processes and procedures 
in addition  in november we entered into a collaborative product development and commercialization agreement with path program for appropriate technology in health to develop a rapid batch hpv test product for use in developing countries 
digene and path will jointly fund the efforts subject to certain maximum funding obligations  and digene will perform the product development and commercialization activities 
during the second half of fiscal we completed the establishment of a research team to pursue this program and began active research into a rapid batch hpv test product candidate 
with respect to regulatory submissions in fiscal we developed and completed the clinical validation of our rapid capture system for semi automated processing of our hc high risk hpv dna tests 
we initially submitted the pma supplement to the fda on november  we provided follow up data and information on april  to facilitate completion of the fda s review 
we received this approval on may  we expect this claim will expand existing indications for our hc high risk hpv dna test to allow high volume  semi automated human papillomavirus dna testing 
developed and completed the clinical validation of the use of chlamydia and gonorrhea testing using our hc ct gc tests from cytyc corporation s thinprep preservcyt solution specimens 
we submitted k pre market notifications for each of our test products for chlamydia and gonorrhea each test separately plus our combined hc ct gc test between november and january the fda s review of these submissions is ongoing and we continue to work with the fda to provide the information needed to facilitate completion of its review 
finally  with respect to modification of the design or capabilities of our diagnostic test products and equipment offerings  in fiscal we achieved technical feasibility of our next generation platform proprietary dna test for ultra sensitive detection of dna targets in a highly multiplexed modality 
selling and marketing expenses  including royalty expense  increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  agency fees  which increased to approximately  professional services  which increased to approximately  and expenses related to the development of physician conferences and education  which increased to approximately  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in royalties expense  which decreased to approximately  due primarily to the reversal of an accrual of approximately  based on the reduced probability that a specific royalty liability would materialize 
the increase in personnel costs related to our increased hiring activities 
the increase in agency fees related to costs under our physician detailing agreement with pdi  inc pdi recruited and administered a digene specific physician detailing sales organization dedicated to educating physicians about the benefits of the digene hpv test in the united states 
the professional services increase was due largely to the use of consultants to assist with the rapid growth of our distribution infrastructure in europe 
geographically  the majority of the increase in our selling and marketing expenses for fiscal  excluding royalties  was incurred in the united states  which increased to approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal  as we expanded our direct sales and marketing activities in the united states to increase sales of our hpv test products 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  insurance  which increased to approximately  principally related to increased costs for directors and officers insurance coverage  and professional fees  which increased to approximately  primarily related to costs associated with legal matters  which increased to approximately  geographically  the majority of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal was incurred in europe  which increased  to approximately  over the corresponding period in fiscal as we invested in infrastructure required to support the direct distribution of our products in europe 
interest income decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was due to lower interest rates in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal interest expense decreased to approximately  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal primarily due to the reduction in our long term debt due to abbott laboratories as quarterly principal payments were made on an outstanding promissory note  which lowered the debt 
other income decreased to approximately  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  due almost entirely to reduced foreign exchange gains as exchange rate fluctuations were not as significant in fiscal as they were in the net income tax benefit of approximately  in fiscal was primarily related to the partial release of the valuation allowance previously established against our deferred tax assets 
we released approximately  of valuation reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the entire deferred tax asset was fully reserved with a valuation allowance  the  tax provision related exclusively to foreign tax from our brazilian operations 
based upon projected future operating performances  we believed that we would be able to utilize a portion of the value of our nol carryforwards through the reduction of future taxable income 
during fiscal  the amount of valuation allowance we released was the estimated amount to be utilized in the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had total us nol carryforwards of approximately  however  we did not reverse the portion of the valuation allowance related to the potential tax benefits from the exercise of stock options as realization of these benefits was not likely at the time and the amounts are expected to expire unused 
should realization of these benefits become more likely than not  the benefit will be reflected as a reclassification to stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our expenses have significantly exceeded our revenues  resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately  at june  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and revenues from product sales and research and development contracts 
at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating approximately  we had positive cash flows from operations of approximately  for the year ended june  compared to positive cash flows from operations of approximately  for the year ended june  net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal of approximately  included  of net sales and maturities of short term investments to pay patent litigation settlement expenses  as more fully described below  partially offset by approximately  of capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we expect to spend a significant amount of working capital as we further expand our warehouse capacity at our gaithersburg facility  for which we may obtain alternative financing 
on october  we entered into a settlement and license agreement to settle our patent litigation with enzo 
under the agreement with enzo  we received an irrevocable  non exclusive  royalty bearing worldwide license under identified enzo patents 
we made an initial payment to enzo of  of which  can be used to offset future royalty payments under the terms of the agreement  resulting in a one time pre tax charge of  in patent settlement expense 
we will also pay enzo royalties on future net sales of products covered by the license grant  which royalties will be at least  for the first annual period october  to september  and at least  for each of the next four annual periods 
we are obligated to make such guaranteed minimum payments in such first five annual periods under the enzo agreement 
our obligation to make royalty payments will end on april   unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the enzo agreement 
on july  we entered into a settlement and license agreement with georgetown georgetown 
under the agreement with georgetown  we were granted irrevocable  world wide  exclusive  royalty bearing licenses with the right to grant sublicenses under two georgetown patents  as well as corresponding foreign patents and patent applications 
under the georgetown agreement  we made an initial payment of million in july  and we will make a second payment to georgetown no later than october  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in settlement expense in our fiscal fourth quarter results 
digene will also pay georgetown royalties on future net sales of products covered by the license grants 
our obligation to make royalty payments on one of the patents will end on october  and for the other patent on july   unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the georgetown agreement 
in august  we established a leasing facility with eplus group  inc with a total commitment of  we intend to use such facility to fund the lease of computer hardware and associated software 
as of june   we have used approximately  of such commitment 
on april   we entered into a letter agreement with roche molecular systems the roche distribution contract  which established roche molecular systems roche as the co exclusive distributor of our hpv products in europe  africa and the middle east from may  through june  in june  we adopted as our sole strategy for the distribution of our hpv products in europe  africa and the middle east  a combination of direct distribution through our european infrastructure and the use of local distributors and agents 
on june   the term of the roche distribution contract expired  subject to a non exclusive wind down period 
under the roche distribution contract  we had the option  exercisable within days after december   to buy back from roche equipment purchased from us by roche and in use for hpv testing in customer s laboratories on june  in june  as part of our strategic decision  we decided that we would exercise the option to repurchase the equipment 
in recognition of the decision to repurchase the equipment  commencing in the fourth quarter of  we deferred recognition of equipment sold to roche 
equipment sold during this time period had a sales price of million and a cost of million  which amounts were recorded as deferred revenue and deferred costs  respectively 
the deferred revenue and deferred costs were being amortized over a four year period to other revenue as equipment rental and selling and marketing expenses  respectively 
for fiscal  we recorded other revenue and selling and marketing expenses of  and  respectively  related to the amortization of these balances 
for fiscal  we recorded other revenue and selling and marketing expenses of  and  respectively  related to the amortization of these balances prior to the commencement of the repurchase 
at december   when amortization ceased  the remaining deferred revenue and deferred cost balances were  and  respectively  for a remaining net credit as of december  of on december   we amended the roche distribution contract to terminate the wind down period on december  and to establish the procedures for our repurchase from roche of hpv related testing equipment purchased from us by roche under the roche distribution contract 
the repurchase price for the equipment in use for hpv testing in customers laboratories is the equipments december  depreciated value  which is the net selling price less any amounts roche recorded as depreciation based on a straight line basis over a four year period 
the repurchase price for the equipment in inventory is a discount from the transfer price paid by roche under the roche distribution contract 
the parties consummated the hpv equipment repurchase on january   subject to reconciliation 
in january digene and its affiliates paid roche an aggregate of approximately million for the hpv equipment in inventory and in use at customers laboratories in europe 
a portion of the purchase price was paid by the issuance of a note payable due to roche  which was paid in one installment in january  and the remainder of the purchase price was paid in cash 
a final settlement for the repurchased assets was completed with roche in june the total consideration paid to roche for the fixed assets and inventory after reaching a final settlement was  or  after consideration of the remaining net credit of  mentioned above 
we are currently in negotiations with our landlord to expand the manufacturing and research and development space at our gaithersburg facility 
it is likely that we will execute an amendment to our existing lease which will extend the term of the lease beyond our existing commitment and require us to contribute financing to the expansion 
our gaithersburg facility is currently accounted for as an operating lease  and it is anticipated that under the terms of the proposed lease amendment  we will be required to prospectively account for the lease as a capital lease 
if our lease does convert to a capital lease  we will record the fair value of the building on our balance sheet and also record the related lease obligation as a liability 
the financial statement impact of this transaction has not yet been determined but is expected to be material 
we anticipate that working capital requirements will increase moderately for the foreseeable future due to the investment necessary to expand our gaithersburg facility  as well as increasing accounts receivable as a result of expected revenue growth 
we have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts  expand our sales and marketing activities and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations through calendar our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds may change  however  based on numerous factors  including our degree of success in commercializing our products  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities  our progress in product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  our success in increasing and maintaining customer relationships  our ability to receive additional regulatory approvals for our product offerings  the cost and timing of expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and competitive market developments 
to the extent that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  which could include public offerings of our securities using our effective shelf registration statement  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
other than our equipment leasing facility with eplus group  inc  we do not have any committed sources of additional financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
under such conditions  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we have summarized below our material contractual obligations as of june  less than one contractual year one to three years four to five years after five years obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after fiscal long term debt physician detailing agreement operating leases minimum royalty payments total contractual cash obligations on october   we paid enzo million under the terms of the agreement with enzo 
of the million payment  million is being used to offset future minimum royalty payments 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our consolidated financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a weighted average approach  which approximates the first in first out method of inventory management 
we also record provisions for inventories which may not be salable due to anticipated trends in sales volume and or pricing and our estimates of net realizable value 
these provisions are determined based on significant estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we establish allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns and discounts based on historical default rates and specifically identified problem accounts 
additionally  we defer approximately two percent of product sales as a reserve for future warranty costs 
accounting for employee stock options 
we account for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 and related interpretations  which allow us to recognize compensation costs for the excess of the fair value of the stock at the grant date over the exercise price  if any 
an alternative method of accounting would apply the principles of sfas no 
 which require the fair value of the stock option to be recognized at the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense over the stock option s vesting period 
had we applied the principles of sfas no 
for our employee options  our net loss would have been approximately  and  during our fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  and our net income would have been approximately  during our fiscal year ended june   instead of our reported net loss which approximated  and  during our fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  and our reported net income of approximately  during our fiscal year ended june  income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we recognized an income tax benefit of  for the year ended june   primarily related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax asset 
realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
due to the uncertainty of realization of these tax benefits  in fiscal and we have provided a valuation allowance against the us net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits related to the exercise of stock options as well as other us net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits expected to expire unused 
we have also provided a valuation allowance against foreign net operating loss carryforwards expected to expire unused 
we review our deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required  primarily based on recent historical financial trends and our estimates of future taxable income 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a valuation allowance and an expense in the period of change 
a significant portion of the remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance  if released  will be reflected as a direct increase to stockholders equity and will not impact the consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining valuation allowance  if released  will be reflected as an increase to book income and will impact the consolidated statement of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our exchange rate risk comes from our operations in europe and south america 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was immaterial for the years ended june   and interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the million of cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments owned by us as of june  such investments are money market debt securities that generate interest income for us on cash balances 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments 
we do not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on our business
