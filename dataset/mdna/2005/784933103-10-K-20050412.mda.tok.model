sms s increased share of field services resulted from its more favorable cost structure 
the increase in cost as a percentage of net revenues is primarily a result of a decrease in per unit fee revenues that do not have a proportionate decrease in cost 
as discussed above under critical accounting policies revenue recognition  the company s revenue consists of service fee revenue  which is earned when the merchandising services are performed and  therefore  has proportionate costs in the period the services are performed  and per unit fee revenue  which is earned when the client s product is sold to the consumer at retail  not when the services are performed and  therefore  does not have proportionate costs in the period the revenue is earned 
since the merchandising service and the related costs associated with per unit fee revenue are normally performed prior to the retail sale  and the retail sales of client products are influenced by numerous factors including consumer tastes and preferences  and not solely by the merchandising service performed  in any given period  the cost of per unit fee revenues may not be directly proportionate to the per unit fee revenue
