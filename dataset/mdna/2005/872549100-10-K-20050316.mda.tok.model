effective june   the company changed its fiscal year end from may to december in accordance with an agreement and plan of merger with laservision centers  inc laservision  the company completed a business combination with laservision on may   which resulted in laservision becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of tlcvision 
accordingly  laservision s results are included in the company s statement of operations beginning on the date of acquisition 
laservision is a leading access service provider of excimer lasers  microkeratomes and other equipment and value and support services to eye surgeons 
the combined companies provide a broader array of services to eye care professionals to ensure these individuals provide superior quality of care and achieve outstanding clinical results 
the company believes this will be the long term determinant of success in the eye surgery services industry 
the company continually assesses patient  optometric and ophthalmic industry trends and developing strategies to improve laser vision correction procedure volumes and increase revenues 
cost reduction initiatives continue to target the effective use of funds  and our growth initiative is focusing on future development opportunities for the company in the eye care industry 
the company recognizes revenues at the time procedures are performed or services are rendered 
revenues include amounts charged patients for procedures performed at laser centers  amounts charged physicians for laser access and service fees  and management fees from managing refractive and secondary care practices 
under the terms of management service agreements  the company provides non clinical services  which include facilities  staffing  equipment lease and maintenance  marketing and administrative services to refractive and secondary care practices in return for management fees 
the management fees are typically addressed as a per procedure fee 
for third party payor programs and corporations with arrangements with tlcvision  the company s management fee and the fee charged by the surgeon are both discounted in proportion to the discount afforded to these organizations 
while the company does not direct the manner in which the surgeons practice medicine  the company does direct the day to day non clinical operations of the centers 
the management service agreements typically are for an extended period of time  ranging from five to years 
management fees are equal to the net revenue of the physician practice  less amounts retained by the physician groups 
procedure volumes represent the number of laser vision correction procedures completed for which the amount that the patient has been invoiced for the procedure exceeds a predefined company wide per procedure revenue threshold 
procedures that may be invoiced for less than the threshold amounts primarily for promotional or marketing purposes are not included in the reported procedure volume numbers 
doctors compensation as presented in the financial statements represents the cost to the company of engaging ophthalmic professionals to perform laser vision correction services at the company s laser centers and fees paid to optometrists for pre and post operative care 
included in costs of revenue are the laser fees payable to laser manufacturers for royalties  use and maintenance of the lasers  variable expenses for consumables and facility fees  as well as center costs associated with personnel  facilities and depreciation of center assets 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses that are not directly related to the provision of laser correction services or cataract services 
the company serves surgeons who performed approximately  refractive and cataract procedures at the company s centers or used the company s laser access services during the year ended december  in the twelve months ended december   the company s refractive procedure volume increased to  compared to  in the twelve months ended december   an increase of  procedures or 
the company believes that the increase in procedure volume was indicative of the growth in the laser vision correction industry as a whole as well as an effective execution of its business strategy 
being an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes will fluctuate due to changes in economic and stock market conditions  unemployment rates  consumer confidence and political uncertainty 
demand for laser vision correction also is affected by perceived safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data

the company accounted for the exchange at historical cost 
immediately after the exchange  occulogix completed an initial public offering ipo whereby occulogix sold  shares of its common stock at per share

research and development during fiscal  the company entered into a joint venture with occulogix for the purpose of pursuing commercial applications of technologies owned or licensed by occulogix applicable to the evaluation  diagnosis  monitoring and treatment of dry age related macular degeneration 
prior to the reorganization and initial public offering ipo of occulogix  the company accounted for its investment as a research and development arrangement since the technology was in the development stage and has not received fda approval

during  the company agreed to advance up to an additional million to occulogix pursuant to a secured convertible grid debenture 
the first million advanced pursuant to such debenture is convertible into common shares of occulogix 
occulogix also granted an option to the company to acquire an amount of common shares equal to the undrawn portion of the debenture at any point in time 
in fiscal  the company expensed million to research and development related to payments made to occulogix during the year 
of this amount  million reduced the value of the million obligation to occulogix  and million represented an additional equity investment in common stock and therefore did not reduce the amount of the remaining obligation

of this amount  the company advanced million to occulogix in the first three quarters of and expensed it as research and development

due to the ipo of occulogix  the company was not required to fund any additional amounts 
for the year ended december   the million research and development expense related to occulogix was offset by a million reimbursement of an unrelated research and development investment that was previously expensed 
critical accounting policies impairment of goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
sfas requires the company to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
because quoted market prices do not exist for the company s reporting units  the company uses the present value of expected future cash flows to estimate fair value 
management must make significant estimates and assumptions about future conditions to estimate future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  including general economic and competitive conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges related to these assets 
during the transitional period ended december  and the fiscal year ended may   the company determined that significant impairments in the value of the goodwill had occurred and recorded charges to earnings in both periods 
impairment of long lived assets the company accounts for its long lived assets in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to assess the recoverability of these assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset group might not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist  the company determines whether the projected undiscounted cash flows will be sufficient to cover the carrying value of such assets 
this requires the company to make significant judgments about the expected future cash flows of the asset group 
the future cash flows are dependent on general and economic conditions and are subject to change 
a change in these assumptions could result in material charges to income 
during the fiscal year ended may  the company determined that a significant impairment in the value of its amortizable intangible assets and certain of its fixed assets had occurred and recorded a charge to earnings 
recoverability of deferred tax assets the company has generated deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the income tax basis of such assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of the valuation allowances  the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had valuation allowances of million to offset net deferred tax assets of million 
the valuation allowance was based on the company s assessment that recovery of the deferred tax assets is not likely due to the company s history of generating taxable losses 
in the event the company determines it is likely to be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  the valuation allowance would be reduced  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
accrual of medical malpractice claims the nature of the company s business is such that it is subject to medical malpractice lawsuits 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains insurance in the us for individual malpractice claims with a deductible of  per claim and a total annual aggregate deductible of million 
the company is self insured for its operations in canada 
management and the company s insurance carrier review malpractice lawsuits for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
the company has recorded reserves to cover the estimated costs of the deductible for both reported and unreported medical malpractice claims incurred 
the estimates are based on the average monthly claims expense and the estimated average time lag between the performance of a procedure and notification of a claim 
if the number of claims or the cost of settle claims is higher than the company s historical experience or if the actual time lag varies from the estimated time lag  the company may need to record significant additional expense
