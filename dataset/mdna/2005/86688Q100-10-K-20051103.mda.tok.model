critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these areas include bad debts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  observance of trends in particular areas  information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for contingent tax liabilities at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes million of accruals intended to cover contingent liabilities for taxes and interest it may be required to pay in various tax jurisdictions 
a substantial portion of the accruals relates to the tax treatment of gains on the sale of a portion of the company s non us operations 
the accruals to cover contingent tax liabilities also relate to management fees  non competition payments and other items that have been deducted in arriving at taxable income  which deductions may be disallowed by taxing authorities 
if those deductions were to be disallowed  the company would be required to pay additional taxes and interest since the dates such taxes would have 
table of contents been paid had the deductions not been taken 
the company may also be subject to penalties 
the ultimate resolution of these tax contingencies will be dependent upon a number of factors  including discussions with taxing authorities and the nature  extent and timing of any restitution or reimbursement received by the company 
the company believes that the accruals that have been recorded are adequate to cover the tax contingencies 
if the ultimate resolution of the tax contingencies is more or less favorable than what has been assumed by management in determining the accruals  the accruals may ultimately be excessive or inadequate in amounts that are not presently determinable  but such amounts may be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
potential impairment of goodwill the company has significant goodwill recorded in its accounts 
the company is required to determine at least annually  whether or not there has been any permanent impairment in the value of these assets 
certain indicators of potential impairment that could impact the company s reporting units include  but are not limited to  the following i a significant long term adverse change in the business climate that is expected to cause a substantial decline in advertising spending  ii a permanent significant decline in a reporting unit s newspaper readership  iii a significant adverse long term negative change in the demographics of a reporting unit s newspaper readership and iv a significant technological change that results in a substantially more cost effective method of advertising than newspapers 
valuation allowance deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount which  the company estimates  is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  the resulting adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase net earnings in the period such a determination was made 
similarly  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would decrease net earnings in the period that such a determination was made 
defined benefit pension plans the company sponsors several defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans for domestic and foreign employees 
these defined benefit plans include pension and post retirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
in determining these obligations and related expenses  key assumptions are made concerning expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  the company evaluates  among other things  input from actuaries  expected long term market returns and current high quality bond rates 
the company will continue to evaluate the expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized by the company over a period of approximately years  which represents the weighted average remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience  changes in assumptions and from differences between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  the company had unrecognized net actuarial losses of million 
these unrecognized amounts could result in an increase to 
table of contents pension expense in future years depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at december   and during  and  excluding discontinued operations  non cash charges of million million  net of tax and minority interest  million million  net of tax and minority interest  and million million  net of tax  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive loss for the increase in minimum pension liability 
similar charges may be required in future years as the impact of changes in global capital markets and interest rates on the value of the company s pension plan assets and obligations is measured 
during  the company made contributions of million to defined benefit pension plans 
global capital market and interest rate fluctuations could impact future funding requirements for such plans 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional company contributions may be required 
if the company is required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit pension plans  reported results could be adversely affected  and the company s cash flow available for other uses would be reduced
