item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation all percentage amounts and ratios were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
operating results for the year ended december   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future fiscal years 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
overview we have been a public company for five years  and have built upon our broad technology platform to establish ourselves as a profitable company with several complementary operating businesses 
since our initial public offering in  our revenue has increased at a compounded average annual rate of  and we have been profitable since the first quarter of since our inception  we have invested heavily in establishing the technology  instrumentation  and informatics necessary to pursue high throughput discovery of materials 
these materials include catalysts to manufacture commodity chemicals and polyolefins  polymers and phosphors for life science and industrial applications  and specialized materials for electronics applications 
we believe we are now well positioned to capitalize on this investment 
we believe that the drivers of our near term growth and profitability are already in place  namely the credibility and commitment afforded by our alliances with exxonmobil and dow  a visible improvement in chemical industry spending levels  the near term growth potential of our royalty income stream  and the expansion of our software business 
current year developments our major achievements in and their impact on our business are highlighted below alliance in december  we entered into a five year strategic alliance agreement with the dow chemical company to enhance research and development activity within dow through high throughput experimentation technologies and informatics solutions provided by us 
this alliance agreement enables a company wide commitment by dow to high throughput research and r d informatics solutions 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to perform research in a number of exclusive areas  develop and provide discovery tools  and license our renaissance suite of software as well as certain intellectual property 
dow is obligated to make payments to us over the five year term of approximately million 
we expect that approximately of this revenue will be service revenue  product revenue  and license revenue 
in addition  we are also entitled to receive royalties on commercialized discoveries resulting from the collaborative research 
this alliance  along with the similar alliance we entered into with exxonmobil in  demonstrates the ability of our technologies to transform our customers r d and has secured over million revenue for us to recognize within the term of the agreements 
acquisition in november  we completed the acquisition of intellichem  an oregon based leading provider of intelligent electronic lab notebooks ieln for customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical industries 
this acquisition not only expanded our software into non high throughput markets but also enhanced our software offering so that our informatics framework can support each step of experimentation 
material commercialization in september  dow announced the commencement of commercial production of versify plastomers and elastomers  a family of products manufactured using symyx discovered catalysts 
versify polymers are designed to improve optics  sealing performance  elasticity  flexibility  and softness for packaging producers  manufacturers of thermoplastic elastomers and olefins  and converters in the consumer products sector 
we expect to receive royalties from the sale of these polymers beginning in the first quarter of in december  tokyo based jsr corporation announced that it had begun commercial sales of new electronic materials containing polymers made under a license from us 
we expect to earn royalties from the sale of these products beginning in the first quarter of as of december   we had a total of three commercialized materials 
core x we adopted a modular approach to selling discovery tools to facilitate more timely customer purchases 
this modular approach allows customers to build up full combinatorial high throughput experimentation capability over time by acquiring stand alone portions of the systems 
this approach showed its potential in through the delivery of multiple units of core x systems to pharmaceutical companies 
in the year ended december   we generated total revenue of million  with operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
our earnings were impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with the intellichem acquisition and variability in our effective income tax rate 
included in the operating income and net income were approximately million of purchase accounting adjustments and other special charges arising from the acquisition of intellichem  including an in process research and development charge of million  the amortization of intangible assets and other merger related expenses 
for  we had an effective income tax rate of  compared to in the effective rate reflected the recognition in the fourth quarter of of over million in benefits from certain of our deferred tax assets  which previously had been reserved 
in  million in tax benefits was recognized 
based on our current forecast for  we anticipate an effective income tax rate of approximately 
during  we generated positive cash flow from operations and ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities after paying a net million to acquire intellichem 
our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to employees at the end of and to employees at the end of primarily as the result of intellichem acquisition as well as meeting the mix and level of staffing promised to exxonmobil in particular 
we anticipate that our headcount will continue to increase to meet the mix and level of staffing required by the exxonmobil and dow alliances and by the expansion of our business 
as of december   our retained earnings were approximately million 
however  we may return to the state of accumulated deficits as we continue to expand staffing  equipment  and facilities  and due to the requirement to expense employee stock options after july  see risk factors 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance our technologies  including for the development of new instruments and software 
in addition  our strategy is to expand our operations and to continue to build our research and development  business development  and marketing efforts 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report on form k  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
preparing financial statements and related disclosures requires management to exercise judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  revenue recognition  establishing the warranty expense accrual  establishing slow moving  obsolete and excess inventory reserves  determining when technical feasibility for our software products has been achieved  and determining the useful life of intangible assets 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are impacted significantly by judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
 revenue recognition  the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  and other authoritative accounting literature 
we generate revenue from services provided under research collaborations  the sale of products  license of software  provision of support and maintenance services  and the license of intellectual property 
it is possible for our customers to work with us in multiple areas of our business and contracts may include multiple elements of service revenue  product revenue  and license revenue 
in determining the basis for revenue recognition  we first determine the fair value of any extended warranty services and defer this revenue to be recognized over the service period 
for those contracts that involve multiple element deliverables  we identify all deliverables and allocate revenue between the units of accounting in accordance with the emerging issues task force consensus on issue  or eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
in an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  we recognizes revenue from the software and software related elements  as well as any non software deliverable s for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality  in accordance with sop service revenue consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as support and maintenance or extended warranty agreements 
product revenue consists of payments from customers for discovery tools systems  comprising hardware  associated software and intellectual property licenses and consumables 
royalties and license fees include fees for licensing of our software  intellectual property  proprietary materials and technology license payments and royalties on laboratory instruments and software sold under license by third parties 
service revenue we recognize revenue from research collaboration agreements  software consulting  and support and maintenance agreements as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk until the milestones are completed  is recognized upon completion of these milestone events 
milestone payments to date have been immaterial 
revenue allocable to support and maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the support and maintenance is provided 
our product related software licenses may provide for technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis for periods defined within the contract 
revenue related to this post contract customer support is deferred and recognized over the term of the contracted support 
product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of discovery tools hardware and the license of associated software  and all related costs of products sold are expensed  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance has been achieved 
a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance 
a determination is made for each system delivered as to whether software is incidental to the system as a whole 
if software is not incidental to the discovery tools system as a whole  revenue from these arrangements is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
if software is incidental to the discovery tools system  revenue from the sale of the discovery tools system is earned and recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual method to allocate revenue to delivered elements once it has established fair value for all undelivered elements 
software license fees for software licensed on an annual right to use basis  revenue is recognized straight line over the term of the license 
for revenue allocable to the software portion of a multiple element arrangement or licensed on a perpetual basis  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software product to the end user and commencement of the license  unless we have ongoing obligations for which fair value cannot be established or the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectibility is not probable  in which case we recognize revenue only when each of these criteria has been met 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than twelve months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
intellectual property license fees and royalties we recognize license fee revenue for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  in which case the revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize license fee revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
in certain licensing arrangements there is provision for a variable fee as well as a non refundable minimum amount 
in such arrangements  the amount of the non refundable minimum guarantee is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established and the amount of the variable fee in excess of the guaranteed minimum is recognized as revenue when it is fixed and determinable 
we recognize royalty revenue based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing our materials  software  and intellectual property 
if there are extended payment terms  royalty revenues are recognized as these payments become due 
non refundable royalties  for which there are no further performance obligations  are recognized when due under the terms of the agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
warranty expense accrual a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance of a discovery tool system and is included as a cost of product sold 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty expense accrual for each discovery tool system delivered and establishes the accrual based  in part  on reference to actual warranty costs incurred on similar systems 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material impact on our financial statements 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our original estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
for the years ended december    and  we have recorded a favorable adjustment of approximately million  million  and  respectively 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  no amounts are capitalized 
we expense all research and development costs when incurred 
inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a specific identification basis 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 
intangible assets we amortize intangible assets over their estimated economic lives 
determining the estimated economic life of intangible assets requires judgment on the part of management 
for example  if we determined that the estimated economic lives of these assets were one year less than those reported in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the amortization expense of intangibles for would have been increased by  we will conduct impairment reviews of intangible assets annually or when circumstances indicate the impairment of intangible assets 
we will also review the estimated economic life of intangible assets when circumstances indicate the change of economic life of intangible assets 
employee stock options we generally grant stock options to our employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares on the date of grant 
as allowed under the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements in connection with stock options granted to employees with exercise prices not less than fair value 
deferred compensation for options granted to employees is determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of the company s common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
had we elected to expense stock options based on their fair value in accordance with sfas  we would have reported a loss of approximately  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december    and business combination on november   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of intellichem  a provider of intelligent electronic lab notebooks ieln for customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical industries 
the results of intellichem s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
intellichem offers ieln software as well as consulting  education  and support services 
in considering the merger  we determined that the merger would provide us with a product for integrating and unifying chemical research and development data  enabling improvements in the efficiency of research in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries 
the integration of intellichem s ieln solutions and our suite of renaissance software provides the basis for a unified set of tools for high throughput and conventional research 
the resulting integrated suite of applications will allow companies to replace paper laboratory notebooks with an electronic  searchable system 
it will also provide scientists with a robust  broad  and easy to use set of time saving and enabling tools for planning and executing experiments  and provide the entire enterprise with real time collaborative decision support and analysis capabilities to help scientists  engineers and project managers make better decisions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocated the purchase price to the tangible assets  deferred compensation  liabilities  and intangible assets acquired  as well as in process research and development  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the acquired goodwill was assigned entirely to our software segment 
purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the total purchase price for this acquisition was million  consisting of approximately million in cash  million in fair value of assumed stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock  and million in transaction costs  consisting of legal and other professional service fees 
the intrinsic value of these options  totaling approximately million  has been recorded as deferred stock compensation 
the purchase price allocation is as follows in thousands amount fair value of net assets purchased  in process research and development  trade name developed technology  customer relationships  unearned stock compensation deferred tax liabilities  release of valuation allowance against acquirer s deferred income tax assets upon recognition of deferred income tax liabilities on acquired identifiable intangible assets in connection with acquisition of intellichem  goodwill  total  the allocation of the consideration for the acquisition of intellichem to its individual assets and liabilities was based on management s analysis and estimates of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities 
in addition to the value assigned to in process research and development ipr d projects  and intellichem s tangible assets  specific intangible assets were identified and valued 
the identifiable intangible assets included customer relationships  a trade name  and developed technology 
the ipr d project that intellichem has been working on was the development of next generation of intellichem software 
that software has not yet been proven to be technologically feasible but has been developed to a point where it had value associated with potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing date of the acquisition  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the value of ipr d was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
a discount rate of was used which is higher than intellichem s computed weighted average cost of capital of due to inherent risk surrounding the successful development of the ipr d and the increase in projected financial results compared with historical results 
in performing this purchase price allocation  we considered  among other factors  our intention for future use of the acquired assets  analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of intellichem s products 
the fair value of intangible assets was primarily based on the income approach 
the relief from royalty approach was also utilized when appropriate 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values ranged from to 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return and the weighted average return on assets 
risks we identified and considered in this analysis included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  successful completion of development efforts  market growth rates  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
at december   identifiable intangible assets purchased in the intellichem acquisition consisted of the following in thousands  except for useful life with a weighted average useful life of years no significant residual value is estimated for these assets amount useful life trade name years developed technology  years customer relationships  years balance at december   at cost  results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue our total revenue in was million  an increase of from million in this increase was attributable to expansion in all aspects of our business  especially the sale of our discovery tools systems 
our service revenue increased from million in to million in including million and million from a related party in and  respectively 
our product sales increased from million in to million in our revenue from license fees and royalties increased from million in to million in including  from a related party in due to the expansion of our customer base in licensing of materials  software and technology  in particular exxonmobil 
in the year ended december   we sold discovery tools systems compared with in the number of systems sold included both complex workflows as well as our core x modules 
exxonmobil  merck  and an undisclosed partner accounted for   and  respectively  of revenue for the year ended december  exxonmobil  merck  and an undisclosed partner accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenue for the same period in we segregate revenue by the following segments in thousands years ended december  industry collaborations   industry collaborations related party   discovery tools   intellectual property licensing   sensors   software   software related party total   the reconciliation of segment revenue above to the revenue disclosed in the consolidated income statements is provided in note segment disclosure of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
industry collaborations revenue the industry collaborations group generates revenue primarily from the research services it provides to our collaboration partners 
industry collaborations revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in industry collaboration revenue in was primarily attributable to the funding received under the alliance agreement we entered into with exxonmobil effective april the increase in industry collaboration revenue from exxonmobil was partially offset by a decrease in the level of funding received from an undisclosed partner 
we expect to receive over million in revenue from exxonmobil and over million in revenue from dow during the year term of each of the alliances  through our research collaborations  discovery tools  and license of software and intellectual property 
as of december   we have recognized approximately million from exxonmobil alliance  including approximately million in industry collaborations revenue 
we believe these two alliances will greatly contribute to our expected growth in industry collaborations revenue in through industry collaborations revenue related party under an month collaborative research and license agreement entered in may  ilypsa  inc  a related party see note related party transactions of notes to the consolidated financial statements  paid us research funding in consideration for direct costs incurred by us specifically attributable to  or specifically used in furtherance of  the research program 
research funding payments were due to us at the start of each month  with an adjustment at the end of each month for the difference between forecast and actual costs incurred 
revenue resulting from work performed under this agreement during the years ended december  and amounted to million and million  respectively  and has been classified as related party revenue 
discovery tools revenue the discovery tools group generates revenue primarily from the sale of discovery tools and associated software and intellectual property 
discovery tools revenue increased from million in to million in for the year ended december   discovery tools revenue included million of product sales  million of service revenue  and  of license revenue 
for the year ended december   discovery tools revenue included million of product sales and million of service revenue 
the increase in discovery tools revenue in was primarily due to increased shipments of discovery tools systems in during year  we shipped discovery tools systems  including our core x modules  to chemical  pharmaceutical  academic institution  and several other customers 
we adopted our modular strategy to facilitate more timely customer purchases whereas purchase decision on a complete discovery tools system usually takes a long time to make 
this modular approach allows our customers to build up full combinatorial high throughput experimentation capability over time by acquiring stand alone portions of the discovery tools systems 
in we successfully sold several less expensive modules of our discovery tools systems to pharmaceutical companies 
under the exxonmobil and dow alliances  we are contracted to deliver multiple discovery tools systems in the next few years 
we also negotiate with other chemical and pharmaceutical companies for the sale of discovery tools systems 
we believe our expanding customer base will contribute to our expected growth of discovery tools revenue 
intellectual property licensing revenue the intellectual property licensing group generates revenue primarily from the licensing fees received from licensing of our intellectual property and from royalties paid by third party licensees for sale of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
intellectual property licensing revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in licensing revenue in was primarily due to payments received from exxonmobil and uop 
we believe that the demonstrated acceptance of our high throughput experimentation technology by our customers will lead to the expected growth in our license fee revenue in future years 
in september  dow announced the commencement of commercial production of the versify plastomers and elastomers  a family of products manufactured using symyx discovered catalysts 
versify polymers are designed to improve optics  sealing performance  elasticity  flexibility  and softness for packaging producers  manufacturers of thermoplastic elastomers and olefins  and converters in the consumer products sector 
we expect to receive royalties from the sale of these polymers beginning in the first quarter of in december  jsr corporation announced the commencement of commercial sales of new electronic materials containing polymers made under a license from us 
we expect to earn royalties from the sale of these products beginning in the first quarter of we believe that these two commercialized materials  along with the one commercialized by agfa in  will contribute to our growth in intellectual property licensing revenue in the future 
software revenue the software group generates revenue primarily from the licensing of renaissance and electronic laboratory notebook ieln software and provision of associated support  maintenance and consulting services 
software revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in software revenue in was primarily due to the increased revenue from exxonmobil and pfizer for software licenses  and associated maintenance and support 
during  we also initiated a couple of pilot programs for stand alone software licensing with chemical and pharmaceutical companies 
sensors revenue the sensors group offers development services and licenses for specific applications to our sensor technology 
our sensors revenue in both and consisted primarily of payments received from hella kg 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the increase in the cost of products sold was due to the increase of product sold 
the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenue in was due to a change in the product mix shipped in the respective years  the development costs related to prototypes delivered being expensed as discussed below  and a favorable adjustment of warranty reserve of approximately million 
the cost of products sold will be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volume in each period 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales is expected to fluctuate from period to period because the majority of our discovery tools systems are built to order or to particular specifications 
for systems that include a significant development component prior to their commercial build  or systems delivered to customers as a prototype  the development costs incurred prior to the commercial build are expensed as development costs  which results in a lower cost of products sold and higher margin in the quarter in which such a system is delivered to the customer 
the cost of products sold will also be affected by the adjustment of warranty reserve for the pre existing sales 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom we conducted research and development  together with the date upon which the current contract ends and the primary focus of the collaborations 
contracts may only be extended by mutual agreement between us and the collaborative partner 
partner current research contract ends primary focus of current collaborative efforts bp catalysts for certain commodity chemicals exxonmobil catalysts for certain commodity chemicals including olefins we do not track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  we estimate based on full time equivalent fte effort 
approximately of research and development effort in was undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort was on internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business 
this compares with approximately of research and development effort undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort on internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business during because of the technical headcount committed to the exxonmobil alliance  we significantly reduced the fte effort for internally funded research projects 
due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will achieve future milestones or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
research and development expenses in were million  including million of direct costs of research services provided to a related party  compared with million in  including million to a related party  an increase of million or 
the increase in was due primarily to increases in salary related expenses due to the hiring of additional scientific and technical staff to work on research and development projects for exxonmobil and increased headcount to develop our software platform  partially offset by the decrease in direct costs of research services provided to a related party 
research and development expenses represented of total revenue in and of total revenue in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased because the increase in research and development expenses lagged the significant increase in total revenue 
our core businesses are research to discover new materials  the sale of instruments and licensing of related software and licensing of intellectual property and materials discovered in our collaborative and internal research programs 
accordingly  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for business development  legal  general management  finance  and human resources  as well as payments of commissions to our sales agents and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
sales  general and administrative expenses in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase of personnel costs of approximately million  mainly as a result of adding a number of business development staff to manage and support our growth  and an increase in auditing and tax related service fees of approximately million  largely as a result of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  offset partially by the decrease in legal fees for intellectual property litigation 
sales  general and administrative expenses represented of total revenue in and of total revenue in we expect that our sales  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we have expanded our business development and sales staff with the acquisition of intellichem and may continue to expand our personnel as a result of future acquisitions  continue to add to and improve our existing laboratory and engineering facilities  and incur escalating costs related to being a public company  such as increasing professional fees 
acquired in process research and development in november  we acquired intellichem in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach 
at the date of the intellichem acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in see more discussion on acquired in process research and development under business combination 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  for the year ended december  consisted of interest income of approximately million and a  gain from the sale of fixed assets to a related party 
interest and other income expense  net  for the year ended december  consisted primarily of interest income of approximately million 
interest income represents interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
interest income increased in due to the impact of higher average interest rates and a higher average investment balance in we anticipate that our interest income in will be slightly greater than in due to the impact of recent interest rate increases and as our positive cash flows from operating and financing activities continue to increase our average investment balance 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rate was for fiscal year and for fiscal year the effective income tax rate was lower than our statutory rate in both and due to the recognition of approximately million and million  respectively  of income tax benefits from certain of our deferred tax assets in and  which had previously been reserved 
by weighing all available evidence  we believe that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of all remaining significant deferred tax assets at december  as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
our net deferred tax assets primarily relate to federal and state research and development credits and the temporary difference between book and tax depreciation expenses  partially offset by deferred tax liabilities recognized for intangible assets in the intellichem acquisition 
as of december   we had federal and oregon net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating losses arose from the acquisition of intellichem and may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
the net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in  if not utilized 
as of december   we had federal and state research and development tax credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit will begin to expire in  while the state research and development credits have no expiration date 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue our total revenue in was million  a decrease of from million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in our product revenue caused by lower sales of discovery tools systems 
our service revenue increased from million in to million in including million from a related party in 
our revenue from license fees and royalties increased from million in to million in due to the expansion of our customer base in licensing of materials  software  and technology  in particular exxonmobil

industry collaborations revenue industry collaborations revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in industry collaborations revenue in was primarily attributable to the funding received under the new alliance agreement we entered into with exxonmobil effective april the increase in industry collaborations revenue from exxonmobil was partially offset by a decrease in the level of funding received from celanese 
industry collaborations revenue related party revenue resulting from work performed under the ilypsa research agreement during the year ended december  amounted to million  and has been classified as related party revenue 
discovery tools revenue discovery tools revenue decreased from million in to million in the decrease in discovery tools revenue in was primarily due to a lower sales volume of our larger discovery tools systems 
we delivered polymorph discovery tools systems which generated approximately million of revenue in  and none of these same systems were delivered in during year  we shipped discovery tools systems to merck  north dakota state university  battelle memorial institute and several other customers 
discovery tools revenue included million of product sales and million of service revenue for the year ended december  and million of product sales and million of service revenue for the year ended december  service revenue in was higher than as we received approximately million of funding towards the development of two new discovery tool platforms in intellectual property licensing revenue intellectual property licensing revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in licensing revenue in was primarily due to payments received from exxonmobil 
in the final quarter of  we received our first royalty payments from agfa for the sale of our commercialized material 
sensors revenue we started receiving license fees from the licensing of our sensor technology to hella kg in software revenue software revenue increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the increase in license fees received from exxonmobil 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of products sold was due to the change in the product mix shipped in the respective years 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
approximately of research and development effort in was undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort was on internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business 
this compares with approximately of research and development effort undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our partners  and approximately of research effort on internally funded research including development costs related to our discovery tools business during research and development expenses in were million  including million of direct costs of research services provided to a related party  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in was due primarily to increases in salary related expenses due to the hiring of additional scientific and technical staff to work on research and development projects for exxonmobil and our related party  ilypsa 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for business development  legal  general management  finance  and human resources  as well as payments of commissions to our sales agents and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
sales  general and administrative expenses in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of a number of business development staff and their associated costs to manage and support our growth 
sales  general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in net interest income net interest income represents interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalent and available for sale securities 
interest income was million in  compared with million in this decrease was due to lower interest rates in interest expense was nil in  compared with  in provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rate was for fiscal year and for fiscal year the decrease in our effective income tax rate in was due to the fact that we recognized approximately million of income tax benefits from certain of our deferred tax assets in  which had previously been reserved 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
our net deferred tax assets primarily related to revenue that had been recognized for income tax purposes but deferred for financial reporting purposes together with reserves and accruals that had been recognized for financial reporting purposes but not for income tax purposes  partially offset by accelerated income tax deductions for insurance and property tax 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  the majority of which were attributable to stock option deductions and whose benefit  if realized  would be recognized directly to equity 
recent accounting pronouncements share based payment on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  and amends fasb sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we must adopt sfas r no later than july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we expect to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings per share in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements stock based compensation 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements upon the adoption of sfas r

liquidity and capital resources this section discusses the effects of the changes in our balance sheets  cash flows  and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows we had positive cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  and finished the year with cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million  after paying a net million in the acquisition of intellichem 
this compared to cash  cash equivalent and available for sale securities of approximately million at december  as of december   we had no long term liabilities 
our operating activities provided million  million  and million of cash in   and  respectively 
the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of research and development funding from collaborative partners and revenue from product sales and licensing  partially offset by operating expenses 
we expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from our operating activities in the near future 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million  respectively  in   and included in the cash used in investing activities was the million net cash paid associated with the acquisition of intellichem 
the other fluctuations from period to period were due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales  and maturity of our available for sale securities 
cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment was million  million  and million  respectively  in   and included in the cash used in purchase of property  plant and equipment was million paid for an office building 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding operations 
financing activities provided cash of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
these amounts are primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under the employee share purchase plan in each of the three years 
the increase from to and to is due primarily to the fact that employees more actively exercised stock options as our stock price increased in and current liabilities decreased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  a decrease of million in deferred revenue from to was largely offset by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and an increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits 
the decrease of deferred revenue was attributable largely to the delivery of discovery tools systems in  for which advanced deposits were made in backlog as of december   our customers have contractually committed to funding of approximately million and million  respectively  for year and beyond  for the purchase of discovery tools systems  licenses to our intellectual property and software  royalty for the sale of products containing symyx discovered materials and for research collaborations 
commitments as of december  and  our principal commitments were million and million  respectively 
principal commitments consisted of our obligations under operating leases and our commitments to purchase inventory and fixed assets 
we will satisfy these obligations as they become due over the next seven years 
future commitments under the operating leases for our facilities and purchase commitments for inventory as of december  are as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years facility commitments      purchase commitments total      we believe that our current cash  available for sale securities balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the coming year 
nonetheless  we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
we have entered into an agreement to acquire synthematix  inc for approximately million of cash at close plus an additional potential payment of up to million over a one year period based on achievement of incremental revenue targets 
we expect to close this transaction in early april contingencies we are currently not a party to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material 
we may become subject to legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable  management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we carry insurance with coverage and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate 
although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  management believes that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations 
off balance sheet financing and related party transactions we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities as of december  we have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
the only transactions between us and related parties during were research and development services  software licenses  software support  and maintenance services provided and the sale of certain research related equipment to ilypsa  inc  loans originally provided to certain employees and executive officers for the exercise of stock options prior to our initial public offering in  which were fully repaid as of december   and mario m 
rosati  one of our directors  is also a member of wilson sonsini goodrich rosati  professional corporation  which provides legal services with respect to real estate issues  for which they receive compensation at normal commercial rates 
dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock 
we currently expect to retain future earnings  if any  to support the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and investments which have maturities of less than two years 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
at december  our investment portfolio comprised approximately million in money market funds and million in us corporate debt 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are therefore subject to interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity in thousands average interest rate total fair value december  available for sale securities     average interest rate
