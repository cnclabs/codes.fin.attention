the outstanding shares of the merging corporations were cancelled and no shares of ablest inc were issued in exchange 
the outstanding shares of ablest inc remain outstanding and were not affected by the merger 
for financial reporting purposes  the company s former industrial maintenance business is reported as a discontinued operation 
the following discussions and analysis of operations and financial condition pertain to the company s staffing services business  which constitutes the continuing operations 
a separate section labeled discontinued operations is included at the end of this discussion and pertains to the disposal of the industrial maintenance business 
overview we derive our revenues from providing clerical  industrial and technical staffing services in the united states 
we currently provide our staffing services principally through service locations in the eastern united states and selected southwestern markets 
we fill positions in data entry  office administration  telemarketing  light industrial assembly  order picking and shipping  network administration  database administration  program analyst both mainframe and client server  web development  project management and technical writing  among others 
we do not service any specific industry or field  instead  our services are provided to a broad based customer list 
substantially all of our revenues are driven by hours billed and billing rates 
our billing rates are generally negotiated and invoiced on a per hour basis 
accordingly  as we place temporary employees  we record revenue based on their hours worked 
our gross margins are determined by deducting temporary employee pay  related taxes  benefits and other direct placement costs such as drug screens  background and reference checks 
piecework contracts are billed to the customer on a cost per unit basis versus an hourly basis 
revenue from piecework contracts is recognized at the time service is performed 
permanent placement services are fee based services to recruit and fill regular staff positions for customers 
revenue from permanent placement services is recognized when a candidate begins full time employment 
customer demand for our employment services depends significantly on the overall strength of the labor market 
improving economic growth typically results in increased demand for labor  resulting in greater demand for our services 
correspondingly  during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction  the demand for our services typically declines 
due to the dependence of the staffing industry growth on economic factors  the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short term nature of staffing assignments  it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with any certainty 
as a result  we monitor a number of economic indicators  as well as recent business trends  in an effort to predict demand for temporary staffing services 
based upon these anticipated trends  we determine whether changes in personnel or other adjustments to our business are appropriate 
historically  our business has expanded through both internal growth of existing branch offices and opening new branch offices 
during  we opened four new branch office locations and focused on increasing revenues of existing branch offices 
during  we intend to open strategically located branches that we believe will enhance our current customer relationships as well as facilitate establishing new ones 
we also intend to explore offering additional lines of service within the staffing industry at existing and new branches 
internal development of new branch locations will require start up capital 
however  we believe that the amount of capital required to open new branches is less than the amount of capital required to consummate acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully open new branches or that  if opened  such branches will result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
we continue to try to improve our gross margins by working closely with our customers to minimize costs associated with workers compensation claims 
we have implemented safety training and education programs at 
table of contents all branch locations and key customer locations 
we also review the risk profiles of certain clients to assess the potential workers compensation claims liabilities as compared to their potential profitability level 
in addition  we expanded our return to work closely monitoring each employee s injury status to enable them to return to work as soon as medically advisable we attempt to manage unemployment insurance costs through aggressive claim adjudication and actively offering displaced employee s alternative job assignments 
additionally  in we implemented a new incentive compensation program for our staff associates  which we believe will result in improved pricing and costing decisions 
the new plan compensates associates for achieving return on revenue target levels as well as higher profit levels 
we cannot assure you that our continued efforts to manage workers compensation claims and unemployment insurance costs or our new compensation plan will result in increased operating margins 
the company is currently evaluating replacement of its existing management information systems with an enterprise wide  fully integrated solution designed to support future growth of the company 
implementation of a new management information system would require a significant investment in software  hardware  outside consultant assistance and internal personnel resources 
although we believe this technology initiative would increase productivity  improve operating efficiencies and lower long term operating costs  there is no assurance that such an initiative would yield its intended results 
the failure to implement new management information systems or  if implemented  delays in completing or an inability to successfully complete implementation of a new management information system could adversely affect our growth plans  operations  liquidity and financial condition

information technology services continue to be especially hard hit by reduced corporate spending for these services in particular 
gross profit was million for fiscal and million for fiscal gross profit decreased  primarily due to an increase in workers compensation self insurance of  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal as compare to fiscal the decrease reflects containment of costs and management of staff levels as the company continues to align services with business volume 
during  the company closed two offices that were not performing to expectation and consolidated three other offices into one location 
these and other office closings and realignments accounted for a  reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal other income expense  net  decreased by  to  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease is due to the receipt in fiscal of  from the canadian workers compensation board for settlement of claims previously funded by the company

for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a allowance for doubtful accounts 
table of contents the company must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
b self insurance reserves the company is self insured for the deductible amount of its general liability and workers compensation coverages 
to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability  established loss development factors are applied to current claims information 
an independent actuary is engaged annually to provide an estimate of ultimate liability and to determine loss development factors going forward 
the calculated ultimate liability is then reduced by cumulative claims payments to determine the required reserve 
management evaluates the accrual on a quarterly basis and adjusts as needed to reflect the required reserve calculation 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may differ from projected loss rates  which could materially affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
c goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
at december   the company did not have indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill and did not have any intangible assets with definite lives 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective december   the first day of fiscal sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase  required to be completed by june   screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary  required to be completed by december   measures the impairment 
factors included in the impairment analysis include expected revenue and ebitda growth rates  working capital needs  discount rates and earnings multiples 
these assumptions are based on management s best estimate of the current and expected economic environment 
as prescribed  the company screened for impairment of goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarters of and and found no instances of impairment of its recorded goodwill 
d deferred tax assets income taxes are accounted for by the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers  within each taxing jurisdiction  whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the years in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  the company has determined that the tax asset will be realizable 
liquidity and capital resources the quick ratio was to and to at december  and december   respectively  and the current ratio was to and to  for the same respective periods 
the primary source of funding is generated from results of operations 
net working capital increased by million during fiscal as a result of operations 
contributing to this was an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the higher level of revenue being generated during this period 
this was offset by a decrease in cash of  and an increase in accrued expenses of million

the most restrictive covenant is the limitation of total indebtedness which caps total funded indebtedness to times the four most recent quarter s ebitda  as defined in the agreement
