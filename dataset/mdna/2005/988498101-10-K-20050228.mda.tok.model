item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview yum brands  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as yum or the company comprises the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut  taco bell  long john silver s ljs and a w all american food restaurants a w collectively the concepts and is the world s largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units 
ljs and a w were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants  inc ygr on may  with  international units  yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us yum became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
through its concepts  yum develops  operates  franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and non traditional qsr restaurants 
traditional units feature dine in  carryout and  in some instances  drive thru or delivery services 
non traditional units  which are typically licensed outlets  include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non traditional locations like malls  airports  gasoline service stations  convenience stores  stadiums  amusement parks and colleges  where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 
the retail food industry  in which the company competes  is made up of supermarkets  supercenters  warehouse stores  convenience stores  coffee shops  snack bars  delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment  and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price  service  convenience  location and concept 
the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local economic conditions  currency fluctuations  demographic trends  traffic patterns  the type  number and location of competing food retailers and products  and disposable purchasing power 
each of the concepts compete with international  national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally owned restaurants  not only for customers  but also for management and hourly personnel  suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 
the company s key strategies are building dominant restaurant brands in china driving profitable international expansion improving restaurant operations multibranding category leading brands the company is focused on five long term measures identified as essential to our growth and progress 
these five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows international expansion international system sales growth local currency number of new international restaurant openings net international unit growth multibrand innovation and expansion number of multibrand restaurant locations number of multibrand units added number of franchise multibrand units added portfolio of category leading us brands us blended same store sales growth us system sales growth global franchise fees new restaurant openings by franchisees franchise fee growth strong cash generation and returns cash generated from all sources cash generated from all sources after capital spending restaurant margins our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis md a 
throughout the md a  the company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
we believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages through and the cautionary statements on pages and all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages through tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as otherwise specifically identified 
factors affecting comparability of results to results and results to results lease accounting adjustments in late and early  a number of companies within the qsr industry announced adjustments to their accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements 
in consultation with our external auditors  we also determined that an adjustment was necessary to modify our accounting in these areas 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment such that all of our leasehold improvements are now being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease  including options in some instances  over which we are recording rent expense  including escalations  on a straight line basis 
the cumulative adjustment  primarily through increased us depreciation expense  totaled million million after tax 
the portions of this adjustment that related to full year and fourth quarter were approximately million and million  respectively 
as the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to any of those prior period financial statements  the entire adjustment was recorded in the consolidated financial statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements 
we anticipate that the impact of this accounting change will result in additional expense of million in ygr acquisition on may   the company completed its acquisition of ygr  the parent company of ljs and a w 
see note for a discussion of the acquisition 
as of the date of the acquisition  ygr consisted of and company and franchise ljs units  respectively  and and company and franchise a w units  respectively 
in addition  multibranded ljs a w restaurants were included in the ljs unit totals 
except as discussed in certain sections of the md a  the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in was not significant relative to amendment of sale leaseback agreements as discussed in note  on august  we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our acquisition of ygr such that the agreements now qualify for sale leaseback accounting 
restaurant profit decreased by million and by million in and  respectively  as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment 
the decrease in restaurant profit was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense 
canada unconsolidated affiliate dissolution on november   we dissolved our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated restaurants in canada 
we owned of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method 
of the restaurants previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate  we now operate the vast majority of pizza huts and taco bells  while almost all kfcs are operated by franchisees 
as a result of operating certain restaurants that were previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate  our company sales  restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses increased and our franchise fees decreased 
additionally  on a full year basis other income increased as we recorded a loss from our investment in the canadian unconsolidated affiliate in as a result of the dissolution of our canadian unconsolidated affiliate  company sales increased million  franchise fees decreased million  restaurant profit increased million  general and administrative expenses increased million and other income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the impact on net income was not significant 
the impact of the dissolution on our results was also not significant 
sale of puerto rico business our puerto rico business was held for sale since the fourth quarter of and was sold on october  for an amount approximating its then carrying value 
company sales and restaurant profit decreased million and million  respectively  franchise fees increased million and general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  commodity inflation the increased cost of certain commodities negatively impacted our us margins for the year ended december  higher commodity costs  particularly in cheese and meat prices  negatively impacted us restaurant margins as a percentage of sales by approximately basis points for the year ended december  wrench litigation we recorded income of million in and expense of million in see note for a discussion of the wrench litigation 
ameriserve and other charges credits we recorded income of million in  million in and million in see note for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets 
such refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
the following table summarizes our refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising net gains  pre tax a a refranchising net gains for the year ended december  include charges to write down our puerto rico business to our then estimate of its fair value and charges to write down certain us restaurants we currently own but we have offered to sell at amounts lower than their carrying values 
refranchising net gains for the year ended december  also include charges to write down our puerto rico business to our then estimate of its fair value 
as previously noted  we sold our puerto rico business effective october  for an amount approximating its then carrying value 
in addition to our refranchising program  from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing  we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively store closures 
the following table summarizes company store closure activities number of units closed store closure costs income a impairment charges for stores to be closed a store closure income in is primarily the result of gains from the sale of properties on which we formerly operated restaurants 
the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and company store closures is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit  which reflects the decrease in company sales  and general and administrative expenses and b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised 
the amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year 
the amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit

higher food and paper costs were primarily driven by increased commodity costs principally cheese and meats and higher occupancy and other costs were primarily driven by increased expense resulting from the adjustment related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements 
in  the decrease in us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by the increased occupancy expenses due to higher rent  primarily due to additional rent expense associated with the amended ygr sale leaseback agreements  and utilities 
the higher food and paper costs were primarily due to the impact of unfavorable discounting and product mix 
also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs  primarily driven by low single digit increases in wage rates 
in  the increase in international restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales increases on restaurant margin and lower food and paper costs principally due to supply chain savings 
the increase was partially offset by a basis point unfavorable impact of operating certain restaurants in canada  which is a market with below average margins  that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate  increased labor costs in certain markets and a basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation 
in  the decrease in international restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact on margin of same store sales declines and a basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation 
the decrease was partially offset by the impact of supply chain savings on the cost of food and paper principally in china  and the cessation of depreciation expense of approximately million for the puerto rico business while it was held for sale 
the impact from foreign currency translation on margins as a percentage of sales is a result of the portfolio of markets effect 
international margin percentages in total are impacted unfavorably when currencies strengthen in markets with below average margins 
those markets contributing to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation on margin have below average margins largely due to their higher labor costs 
worldwide general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million or in  including a unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation 
the increase was driven by higher compensation related costs  including incentive compensation  amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in china and other international growth markets and pension costs 
also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees and increased reserves related to potential development sites and surplus facilities 
the increase was also partially attributable to expenses of million associated with operating the restaurants we now own in canada that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses due to the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants 
general and administrative expenses increased million or in  including a unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation 
excluding the unfavorable impact from both foreign currency translation and the ygr acquisition  general and administrative expenses were flat for lower management incentive compensation costs were offset by increases in expenses associated with international restaurant expansion and pension expense 
worldwide franchise and license expenses franchise and license expenses decreased million or in the decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lapping the biennial international franchise convention held in franchise and license expenses decreased million or in the decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables  principally at taco bell 
worldwide other income expense equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates foreign exchange net gain loss other income expense other income increased million or in  including a favorable impact from foreign currency translation 
the increase was driven by an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates  principally in china  and the dissolution of our unconsolidated affiliate in canada which recorded a loss for the year ended december  other income increased million or in  including a favorable impact from foreign currency translation 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates  particularly in china

the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors  including the reversal of reserves in the current year associated with audits that were settled as well as the effects of certain international tax planning strategies implemented in the decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping the benefit in of amending certain prior us income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years as well as the recognition in of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not 
the effective tax rate decreased percentage points to 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a percentage point benefit of amending certain prior us income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years 
the returns were amended upon our determination that it was more beneficial to claim credit for such taxes than to deduct such taxes  as had been done when the returns were originally filed 
in future years  we anticipate continuing to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in the then current year  as we have done in  and however  the amended return benefit recognized in was non recurring 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not 
see note for a discussion of valuation allowances 
adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns  including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets 
adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that we believe may impact our exposure

net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and lower capital spending compared to  partially offset by the impact of the timing of purchases and sales of short term investments 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the million acquisition of ygr in and lower capital spending in net cash used in financing activities was million versus million in the increase in was primarily driven by higher share repurchases  higher net debt repayments and the payment of two quarterly dividends  partially offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million versus million in the increase was primarily driven by higher net debt repayments and higher shares repurchased in consolidated financial condition assets increased million or to billion primarily due to an increase in property  plant and equipment driven by capital expenditures in excess of depreciation 
the increase was also partially driven by the existence of a federal income tax receivable at december  recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the timing of the collection of certain accounts receivable 
the increase was partially offset by the impact of higher spending for financing activities compared to  as described above  and a decrease in other assets as a result of the utilization of deferred income tax assets in liabilities decreased million or to billion primarily due to lower long term debt as a result of the early redemption of our senior unsecured notes of million in and lower income taxes payable due to the excess of current year tax payments made over the current year provision 
liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations  which require a limited yum investment 
in each of the last three fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion 
these cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending  while at the same time reducing our long term debt balances 
we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations  we believe our operating cash flows  our ability to reduce discretionary spending  and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in and beyond 
we initiated the payment of quarterly dividends in with two quarterly dividends paid totaling million 
additionally  on november  our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  on an annual basis  the company is targeting a payout ratio of to of net income 
on september   the company executed an amended and restated five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility totaling billion which replaced a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the old facility with a maturity date of june  under the terms of the credit facility  the company may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were borrowings of million outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or to over an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  will depend upon our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  level of cash dividends  aggregate non us investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement 
these covenants are substantially similar to those contained in the old facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december   and do not anticipate that the covenants will impact our ability to borrow under our credit facility for its remaining term 
the remainder of our long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  on november   we voluntarily redeemed all of our senior unsecured notes due in may the notes in accordance with their original terms 
the notes  which had a face value of million  were redeemed for an amount of approximately million using primarily cash on hand as well as some borrowings under our credit facility 
the redemption amount approximated the carrying value of the notes resulting in no significant impact on net income 
we estimate that in capital spending  including acquisitions of our restaurants from franchisees  will be approximately million 
we also estimate that in refranchising proceeds  prior to taxes  will be approximately million  employee stock options proceeds  prior to taxes  will be approximately million and sales of property  plant and equipment will be approximately million 
a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in may is expected to be completed during the first half of at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase  through november  up to approximately million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under this program 
in january  the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of the company s outstanding common stock to be purchased through january in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt a   capital leases b operating leases b   purchase obligations c other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations   a excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to approximately  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology and commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as marketing  maintenance  consulting and other agreements 
we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table 
our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan s funded status 
the pension plan s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets 
we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in  but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plan s expected september  funded status 
during  we made a million discretionary contribution to our funded plan  none of which represented minimum funding requirements 
our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made postretirement benefit payments of million in also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses as well as employee healthcare claims for which we are self insured 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we had provided approximately million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the company s historical refranchising programs and  to a lesser extent  franchisee development of new restaurants  at december  in support of these guarantees  we posted million of letters of credit at december  we also provided a standby letter of credit of million at december   under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools 
the total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately million at december  any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral 
we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities 
these provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss gain 
new loans are not currently being added to either loan pool 
we have guaranteed certain lines of credit and loans of unconsolidated affiliates totaling million at december  our unconsolidated affiliates had total revenues of over billion for the year ended december  and assets and debt of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  other significant known events  trends or uncertainties expected to impact operating profit comparisons with new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r in  we will be required to recognize compensation cost in the financial statements for all share based payments to our employees  including grants of stock options  based on the fair value of the share based awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of the share based awards will be determined using option pricing models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the quarter ending december  for the company and early adoption is encouraged 
we are in the process of evaluating the use of certain option pricing models as well as the assumptions to be used in such models 
when such evaluation is complete  we will determine the transition method to use and the timing of adoption 
we currently do not anticipate that the impact on net income on a full year basis of the adoption of sfas r will be significantly different from the historical pro forma impacts as previously disclosed 
see note sale of puerto rico business as a result of the sale of our puerto rico business on october   company sales  restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses will decrease by million  million and million  respectively  and we estimate franchise fees will increase by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  extra week in our fiscal calendar results in a fifty third week every five or six years 
fiscal year will include a fifty third week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our us businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period  as opposed to a monthly  basis 
in the us  we anticipate permanently accelerating the timing of the kfc business closing by one week in december  and thus  there will be no fifty third week benefit for this business in we estimate the fifty third week will increase revenues and operating profit in by approximately million and million  respectively 
while the impact of the fifty third week adds a potential incremental benefit of to diluted earnings per share  we believe this benefit will be offset by expense associated with strategic asset actions and refranchising kfc restaurants in the us international reporting changes in the first quarter of we will begin reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure 
the china division will include the people s republic of china china  thailand and kfc taiwan  and the international division will include the remainder of our international operations 
this reporting change will not impact our consolidated results 
in the first quarter of we will also change the china business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our us business 
previously our china business  like the rest of our international businesses  closed one month or one period for certain of our international businesses earlier than yum s period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting 
as a result  the operations of the china business for the one month period ending december  will be recognized as an adjustment to consolidated retained earnings in the first quarter of  as opposed to being recorded in our consolidated statement of income  to maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations 
our consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of will thus include the results of operations of the china business for the months of january and february and the months included in each quarterly reporting period thereafter will begin one month later in than in previous years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value 
our semi annual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
these impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant  which can be for a period of over years  and any terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows  including terminal value  of the restaurant at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate used is our cost of capital  adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist 
when it is probable that we will sell a restaurant within one year  we write down the restaurant to its fair value 
we often refranchise restaurants in groups and  therefore  perform such impairment evaluations at the group level 
fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs 
estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers  and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary 
in addition  we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants 
the fair values of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are generally significantly in excess of their carrying value 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit 
for  there was no impairment of goodwill identified during our annual impairment testing 
our impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of values assigned to certain trademarks brands of which we have acquired ownership 
we believe the value of these trademarks brands is derived from the royalty we avoid  in the case of company stores  or receive  in the case of franchise stores  due to our ownership of the trademarks brands 
thus  anticipated sales are the most important assumption in valuing trademarks brands 
we limit assumptions about sales growth  as well as other factors impacting the fair value calculation  to those that are supportable based on our plans for the applicable concept 
the most significant indefinite lived trademark brand asset we have recorded is the ljs trademark brand in the amount of million 
the fair value of this trademark brand is currently in excess of its carrying value as are the fair values of all other recorded trademarks brands with an indefinite life 
while we believe the sales assumptions used in our determinations of fair value for our trademarks brands are consistent with our operating plans and forecasts  fluctuations in the assumptions would have impacted our impairment calculation 
if the long term rate of sales growth used in each of our fair value determinations for our trademarks brands had been one percentage point lower  such fair values would have continued to exceed carrying value in all instances 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
allowances for franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities we reserve a franchisee s or licensee s entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
as a result of reserving using this methodology  we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december  see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts  we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees 
we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable 
the potential total exposure under such leases is significant  with million representing the present value  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and  historically  we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 
see note for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty claims 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans was amended in such that employees hired after september  are not eligible to participate 
as of our september  measurement date  these plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of million  an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million and a fair value of plan assets of million 
as a result of the million underfunded status of the plans relative to the abo at september   we have recorded a cumulative million charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax of million as of december  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at september  this discount rate was determined using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities that mirror our expected benefit obligations under the plans 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately million at september  conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately million at september  the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at september  in total  we expect pension expense to increase approximately million to million in the increase is primarily driven by an increase in interest cost because of the higher pbo 
service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate  though  as previously mentioned  the plans are closed to new participants 
a basis point change in our discount rate assumption of at september  would impact our pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rate of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets at both september  and september  was 
we believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
given no change to the market related value of our plan assets as of september   a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our pension plan expense by approximately million 
the losses our plan assets have experienced  along with the decrease in discount rates  have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of million in our plans as of september  for purposes of determining expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of unrecognized actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial loss in given no change to the assumptions at our september  measurement date  actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 
income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves at december   we have a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million and our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk international operating profit constitutes approximately of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  the americas and europe 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical and holding cash in local currencies when possible 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as  on a limited basis  commodity future and option contracts 
commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december   and december   did not significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cautionary statements from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements  we present forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the statements include those identified by such words as may  will  expect  project  anticipate  believe  plan and other similar terminology 
these forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements 
actual results involve risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  and could differ materially from expectations 
company risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  potentially substantial tax contingencies related to the spin off  which  if they occur  require us to indemnify pepsico  inc  changes in effective tax rates  our debt leverage and the attendant potential restriction on our ability to borrow in the future  potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities  our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores  effects and outcomes of legal claims involving the company  the effectiveness of operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts  the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees  the success of our refranchising strategy  volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates  and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies 
industry risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate  including effects of war and terrorist activities  changes in legislation and governmental regulation  new product and concept development by us and or our food industry competitors  changes in commodity  labor  and other operating costs  changes in competition in the food industry  publicity which may impact our business and or industry  severe weather conditions  volatility of commodity costs  increases in minimum wage and other operating costs  availability and cost of land and construction  consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the products of the company and or our competitors  spending patterns and demographic trends  political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates  and the impact that any widespread illness or general health concern may have on our business and or the economy of the countries in which we operate
