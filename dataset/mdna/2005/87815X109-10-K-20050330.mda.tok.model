item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and risk factors management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements contained within this report  including the notes thereto 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors that are beyond our control 
these include the factors set forth in risk factors and forward looking statements 
accordingly  past results and trends may not be reliable indicators of future results or trends 
with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution readers that a number of important factors discussed in this report could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a financial holding company offering full service community banking and financial services through locations in kansas  missouri  nebraska and colorado through our wholly owned banking subsidiaries  teambank n 
a and colorado national bank 
our presence in kansas consists of seven locations in the kansas city metropolitan area and three locations in southeast kansas 
we operate two locations in western missouri  three in the metropolitan area of omaha  nebraska  and three in the colorado springs  colorado metropolitan area 
our total assets over the past nine years have more than doubled  growing from million at january  to million at december  the growth in assets and the corresponding increase in earnings were achieved primarily through purchases of branches of large banks  purchases of community banks  and branch expansions 
our branch expansion includes growth at existing branches as well as the opening of new branches 
accompanying the acquisition growth were increased operating expenses resulting from growth as well as increases in provisions for loan losses and amortization expense of intangible assets related to acquisitions  and in some instances  issuance of our common stock in conjunction with the acquisitions 
our experience is that it takes between to months to realize meaningful net income improvements from acquisitions and expansion due to our emphasis on retaining key employees rather than the immediate implementation of cost reduction measures 
on february   we sold our interest in the insurance agency subsidiary 
financial information as of and for the years ended december   and presents the assets  liabilities and operating results of this subsidiary as discontinued operations 
at december  total assets were million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million as a result of an increase in checking deposits

critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statement of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses we establish allowances for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is based on industry standards  historical experience and an evaluation of economic conditions 
we regularly review delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
management believes that the allowance is adequate for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to provide appropriate allowances for inherent losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on borrowers conditions and changes in economic conditions 
impairment of goodwill analysis as required by the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred 
the evaluation of possible impairment of intangible assets involves judgment based upon short term and long term projections of future performance 
net loss from discontinued operations included an impairment of goodwill of  during the year ended december  as a result of the annual impairment testing and the pending sale of the insurance agency 
there was no impairment of goodwill in or analysis of the results of operations net interest income from continuing operations our income is derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  investment securities  federal funds sold  and interest bearing deposits  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and interest rates earned and expensed 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following tables set forth the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities associated with continuing operations  as well as the amount of interest income or interest expense from continuing operations and the average rate for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate for the periods indicated

total interest income on a tax equivalent basis from continuing operations for was million  representing a decrease of million  or  from million for the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income on loans receivable and a million decrease on taxable investment securities 
interest income on loans receivable decreased due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on the loans receivable to in from in offset with an increase of million in the average loan receivable balance to million in from million in the decrease in the yield of loans receivable reflects the decrease in the rates applied to loans that re priced in as required by the notes terms or were refinanced by customers at lower rates 
interest income from taxable investment securities was million during  a decrease of million  or  from of million 
the decrease was due to a decrease in the average rate of basis points to in from in the decrease in the average rate of investment securities was related to the relatively low interest rates in the market 
the decrease caused many of our portfolio s issuers of securities to retire or prepay their securities prior to maturity since they were able to refinance at lower rates 
because of these early prepayments  we re invested the proceeds in lower yielding securities  which reflect the decline in market interest rates 
in addition  the early prepayments accelerated the amortization on premiums paid for investment securities further decreasing the yield on the securities 
total interest expense from continuing operations was million for  a million  or  decrease from million in the decrease was primarily related to the decrease in average rate paid on savings deposits and interest bearing checking balances to 
in from in  representing a basis point decrease  and to the decrease in average rate paid on time deposits to in from in  representing a basis point decrease 
additionally there was a decrease in the average balance of interest bearing savings and checking deposits of approximately to million in from million in and a decrease of in average time deposit balances to million in from million in the decrease in the average deposits balances was due to the sale of two bank branches in june the average balance of notes payable and federal home loan bank advances increased million as we continued to borrow from the federal home loan bank and invest the proceeds to achieve the planned balance sheet management strategy to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet 
the average rate on notes payable and federal home loan bank advances decreased basis points to during from during as a result of the changes described above  the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis from continuing operations decreased to million during  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to of million 
the following table presents the components of changes in our net interest income from continuing operations  on a tax equivalent basis  attributed to volume and rate 
changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior fiscal year s average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to change in interest rates are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior fiscal year s average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and change in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume

provision for loan losses a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical loss experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to our market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of our loan portfolio 
after considering the above factors  management recorded a provision for loan losses on loans totaling million for the year ended  million for the year ended and million for the year ended the provision recorded for the year ended decreased from primarily as a result of improved quality in the loan portfolio

the decrease in gain on sales of mortgage loans was the result of the decrease in volume of loans refinanced and loans originated and sold due to a stabilizing interest rate environment experienced during the year compared to previous years interest rate environments that were experiencing declining interest rates 
the gain on sale of mortgage loans experienced in may not be indicative of gains in future years as interest rates change 
the magnitude of any future decreased gain on sales of mortgage loans cannot be estimated 
service charges increased approximately  for the year ended compared to the year ended due to an increased volume of overdraft fees and other service charges 
gain on sales of investment securities decreased approximately  for the year ended compared to the year ended due to planned decisions to sell and re invest certain investments maintained in our portfolio 
non interest income from continuing operations was million for the years ended and gain on sale of mortgage loans increased  or  for the year ended compared to the year ended the increase in gain on sale of mortgage loans was the result of the increase in volume of loans refinanced and originated and sold  due to a low interest rate environment during the year

at december  installment loans were million  representing a million decrease  or  from installment loans at december  of million 
total loans receivable were million at december  compared to million at december   representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in total loans receivable was primarily due to our continued allocation of resources to the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate markets 
our commitment to focus our resources on internal loan growth in these areas produced an increase of million  or in these loans compared to offsetting the increase in our commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate loans was the continued decrease in our one to four family portfolio resulting primarily from a decrease in loans held for sale of million 
agriculture loans and farmland real estate loans decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was due to our continued reduction in exposure to the kansas and missouri agricultural markets

loan maturities the following tables present  at december  and  loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio based on contractual schedules 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments

non performing loans consist of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and restructured loans 
when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of a loan  the accrual of interest income is discontinued and any interest accrued to date is reversed through a charge to interest income 
while a loan is on non accrual status  it is our policy that interest income is recognized only after payment in full of the past due principal 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is days or more past due  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents information concerning the non performing assets at the dates indicated 
december dollars in thousands non accrual loans loans days past due and still accruing restructured loans non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing assets were million at december  compared to million at december   representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in non performing assets was primarily due to a decrease in non accrual loans of million as a result of resolving two large credits during that were classified as non accrual at december  non performing loans decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in non performing loans was a result of a decrease in non accrual loans of million 
this decrease was primarily a result of a payoff received on a large loan to a residential property developer of approximately million in the second quarter of classified as non accrual at december  and foreclosure and sale of the collateralized property of approximately million on a loan with an individual for a single family dwelling in the fourth quarter of  classified as non accrual at december  included in the million of non accrual loans at december  were several small loans  the largest was approximately  for a single family dwelling 
non accrual loans had approximately  specific reserves included in the allowance for loan losses at december  we do not anticipate losses on these credits in excess of the specific reserves 
restructured loans at december  consisted of eight relationships 
the largest relationship included an agricultural loan restructured through farmer home administration of approximately  other real estate owned was  at december  compared to million at december  other real estate owned consisted of five properties held by our subsidiary banks  consisting of four commercial buildings  at december  the properties are all located within our market areas 
management is working to sell the real estate as soon as practicable 
during the year ended december   properties held in other real estate owned were sold at a total loss of approximately  non performing assets as a percent of total assets decreased to at december   compared to at december   and at december  non performing assets will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of non performing assets may increase if economic weaknesses are experienced in  although the magnitude of any increase in non performing loans is not determinable 
impaired loans we consider a loan to be impaired when it is deemed probable by management that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
however  when determining whether a loan is impaired  management also considers the loan documentation  the current ratio of the loan s balance to collateral value  and the borrower s present financial position 
included as impaired loans are all loans contractually delinquent days or more and all loans upon which accrual of interest has been suspended 
at december   we had impaired loans totaling million  which have related specific reserves of  this compares to million of impaired loans  which had related specific reserves of million at december  the decrease in impaired loans was the result of the decrease in non accrual loans described above 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended december  was million 
interest income recognized on impaired loans during the period the loans were considered to be impaired for approximated  impaired loans will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of impaired loans could increase if economic weaknesses are experienced in our market area during allowance for loan losses management maintains its allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  historical experience and an evaluation of economic conditions 
we regularly review delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
year ended december dollars in thousands average total loans total loans at end of period allowance at beginning of year loans charged off real estate one to four family construction other commercial lease financing receivables installment and other total charge offs recoveries real estate one to four family construction other commercial lease financing receivables installment and other total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance related to acquisitions allowance at end of period ratio of net charge offs to average total loans allowance to total loans at end of period allowance to non performing loans the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans at december  compared to million  or  of total loans at december  allowance to non performing loans was at december  compared to at the increase in the allowance as percent of non performing loans was due to the decrease in non performing loans during compared to primarily as a result of resolving two large credits classified as non accrual at december  as discussed above 
net charge offs were million for the year ended compared to million for the year ended net charge offs for consisted of several small credits 
the largest charge off during was approximately  for a one to four family real estate loan that went into foreclosure and was sold from other real estate owned 
net charge offs were million for the year ended  compared to million for the year ended net charge offs for primarily consisted of million in commercial loan net charge offs   in installment and other loan net charge offs and  in one to four family loan net charge offs 
the commercial charge offs were comprised of six large loans totaling million 
lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio 
additionally we have a separate loan review process  which reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine compliance with loan policy  including the appropriateness of risk ratings assigned to individual loans  as well as the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based primarily on management s estimates of probable loan losses from the foregoing processes and historical experience 
the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
management believes that the table may be a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowances as a whole 
the table has been derived in part by applying historical loan loss ratios to both internally classified loans and the portfolio as a whole to determine the allocation of the loan losses attributable to each category of loans 
december loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in category category category category category amount as a amount as a amount as a amount as a amount as a of percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage gross of total gross of total gross of total gross of total gross of total allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans dollars in thousands loans secured by real estate one to four family construction and land development other commercial and agricultural lease financing receivables installment and other unallocated the provision for loan losses takes into account many factors such as our prior experience with loan losses and an evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio at any given time  including changes in economic  operating  and other conditions of borrowers  the economies in our areas of operations and to a lesser extent  the national economy and several other factors beyond our control 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans secured by construction and land development decreased approximately  at december  compared to december  due to a decrease in specific reserves identified with certain loans included in this category offset by increases in the allocation of the allowance associated with historical trends and economic conditions due to an increased balance in this category in compared to the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and agricultural loans increased approximately  primarily due to the increase in the allocation associated with applying historic trends and economic conditions to the increased loan balance at compared to the allowance for loan losses allocated to installment and other loans decreased approximately  due to a decrease in the balance of this category of loans in compared to in addition to the decrease of approximately  in specific reserves identified with certain loans included in this category 
investments we invest a portion of our available funds in short term and long term instruments  including federal funds sold and investment securities 
our investment portfolio is designed to provide liquidity for cash flow requirements  to assist in managing interest rate risk  and to provide collateral for certain public deposits and other borrowing arrangements 
at december  and  the investment portfolio was comprised principally of obligations of us government agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  and mortgage backed securities 
total investment securities at december  of million represented a decrease of million from total investments at december  of million 
the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in us government agency securities of million 
as proceeds were received during from called agency securities  the proceeds were used to fund the loan portfolio growth 
we initiated a long term balance sheet management strategy starting in the fourth quarter to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet with the expectation of benefiting from an anticipated increase in interest rates and to borrow long term borrowings during the period of historically low interest rates 
under this strategy we borrowed million in federal home loan advances and purchased short term investment securities and funded loans

a decreasing interest rate environment may cause an unfavorable impact on net interest income and net interest margin and an increasing interest rate environment may increase net interest income over the remaining borrowing period  but the actual magnitude of this impact cannot be estimated

recent accounting pronouncements in december of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments  sfas r 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payments with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes accounting principal board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employee  apb and is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we have historically applied apb to account for stock compensation plans 
the adoption of sfas r will result in higher salaries and employee benefits expense in future periods 
on september  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position  fsp eitf issue  that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf 
originally  this statement was effective for reporting periods beginning after june  and provided guidance on when to record a loss in the statement of operations and when additional information needed to be disclosed on unrealized losses 
other components of eitf regarding quantitative and qualitative information was required to be presented in the financial statements effective for fiscal years ending after december  and was not deferred by the fasb s staff position 
this portion of eitf was adopted in december and the required disclosures are included in footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of the measurement and recognition guidance  once finalized  are not anticipated to have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations but the extent of any impact is not determinable at this time 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  sop 
sop addresses the accounting for certain acquired loans or debt securities  including those acquired in a purchase business combination  that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality between the loan origination date that the date the loan is acquired by an investor  and for which it is probable that at acquisition the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments on the loan 
loans within the scope of this sop that are acquired should be recognized initially at the present value of amounts expected to be received and no allowance for loan losses should be carried over related to these loans at acquisition 
sop prohibits displaying accretable yield and nonaccretable differences in the balance sheet 
sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sop on january  the adoption of sop is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity we continuously forecast and manage our liquidity in order to satisfy cash flow requirements of depositors  borrowers  and our own cash flow needs 
we have developed internal and external sources of liquidity to meet our continued growth needs 
these include  but are not limited to  the ability to raise deposits through branch promotional campaigns  purchased brokered certificates of deposits  maturity of overnight funds  short term investment securities classified as available for sale and draws on credit facilities established through the federal home loan bank of topeka 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december  and december   these liquid assets totaled million and million  respectively 
included in these liquid assets are investment securities of million at december  and million at december  that were pledged as collateral for borrowings  repurchase agreements and for public funds on deposit 
at december  there was approximately million borrowing capacity remaining under agreements with the federal home loan bank of topeka 
during the year  the loan portfolio increased approximately 
decreased liquidity may result in the inability to continue this growth rate in the future or may result in increased cost of funding 
deposit growth through branch promotional campaigns are expected to provide additional sources of funding 
another source of additional funding is the use of brokered certificates of deposits 
management believes our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
asset and liability management asset and liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the re pricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
controlling the maturity of re pricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of re pricing assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
we monitor our assets and liability mix monthly in an effort to maintain consistent earnings performance through control of interest rate risk 
below is a static gap schedule as of december  this is just one of several tools which may be used to measure and manage interest rate sensitivity 
interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented below within selected time intervals based on their re pricing and maturity characteristics 
in this view  the sensitivity position is perfectly matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities re price during any given time period 
excess assets or liabilities re pricing in a given time period results in the interest rate gap shown in the table 
a positive gap indicates more assets than liabilities will re price in that time period  while a negative gap indicates more liabilities than assets will re price 
static gap analysis at december  months through through through through more than or loss months months months months months total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable  net of unearned income investment securities available for sale federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits other assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking time deposits under  time deposits over  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal home loan bank advances notes payable and subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities periodic repricing gap cumulative repricing gap periodic repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets cumulative repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets the table indicates that we are liability sensitive in the less than three month period and the through month period  and are asset sensitive for all other periods 
this means that during the first period classification  interest bearing liabilities re price faster than interest earning assets  thereby improving net interest income when rates are falling and reducing net interest income when rates are rising 
while the static gap method is a widely used measure of interest sensitivity  it is not  in management s opinion  the only indicator of our rate sensitivity 
the following table indicates that at december   if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  our net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in net interest income 
net interest decrease percent change in interest rates income increase change dollar in thousands basis point rise basis point rise base rate scenario basis point decline basis point decline we believe we are appropriately positioned for future interest rate movements  although we may experience fluctuations in net interest income due to short term timing differences between the re pricing of assets and liabilities
