item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
executive overview the year was characterized by revenue growth across all segments of the business 
the most encouraging of these increases came in the growth in net sales of the company s telecom products 
after three years of declining demand  there are signs that the major telecommunications companies are beginning to reinvest to support fiber to the premise projects 
this activity was strong all year even through the typically slower fourth quarter of the company s foremost challenge in came from rising resin costs  both pvc and hdpe  which were supported by high oil and gas prices  restrained supplies and a robust global and domestic end market 
both the carlon and pvc pipe business segments were able to partially offset these higher costs with price increases throughout  however  lamson home products was unable  in  to obtain any price increases from its retail customers 
transportation costs and availability  especially flatbeds  have become a significant concern in with the increased economic activity  higher fuel costs  regulatory changes  driver shortages and the lack of investment in new equipment by carriers 
the company has worked throughout to develop tactical logistic alternatives to ensure customer service  but has also experienced higher freight rates that are not expected to ease anytime soon 
in september the company settled its patent infringement litigation as a result of a mediation process 
in connection with the settlement  the company recorded a net charge of million see also note e 
during the company was able to rationalize some of its manufacturing capacity by selling its pasadena  texas facility 
most of the production equipment was moved to the clinton  iowa facility 
the net expense for the sale of this facility and relocation of production equipment and termination of employees  are included in other expenses see also note m 
late in the first quarter of  the company was notified that ysd industries  inc ysdi  a business the company sold in  was selling the assets of the business and would be unable to fund certain post retirement medical and life insurance benefits  for which the company was contingently liable 
this obligation extends through february  and the estimated liability of million net of tax was recorded in  based on the deteriorating financial condition of ysdi  as a charge from discontinued operations 
as part of the asset sale by ysdi in the first quarter of  the company was able to recover  of notes receivable that had been previously written off 
the company assumed this post retirement obligation and the funding of benefits at the end of the first quarter of the net impact of  net of tax has been recorded as income from discontinued operations in the current year 
the company s secured credit agreement is classified as a current debt as of january  as its maturity date is august at the end of the company was in violation of its leverage ratio covenant 
a waiver of this covenant has been obtained along with an amendment that adjusts the covenant for the first quarter of it is anticipated that the company will refinance this obligation in the first half of  subject to the conclusion of the evaluation of various strategic alternatives pursued by management and the company s investment bankers 
as announced in october  the company is reviewing various strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  including the possible sale of part or all of the company 
this process is continuing 
also see note c 
finally  at the end of  the company had been operating under a compliance plan with the new york stock exchange since november  which called for the company to be in compliance with continued listing standards by the end of the first quarter of the company was notified by the new york stock exchange in april that it is considered in good standing and in compliance with the exchange s continued listing standards 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for years ended dollars in thousands net sales    cost of products sold    gross profit    total operating expenses    litigation settlement  other expense operating income    interest expense  net    income from continuing operations before income taxes    income tax provision    income from continuing operations    net sales for were million compared with million in  an increase of or million 
carlon  which experienced the highest segment net sales growth rate  was favorably impacted by the increased rollouts of telecom customers fiber to the premise projects 
additional market share growth resulted in the increased net sales in the lamson home products business segment 
price increases instituted to offset rising resin costs were the primary reason for net sales increases in the pvc pipe segment 
operationally  the company continues to focus on a key strategic objective of on time  in full  error free delivery of products and services to our customers 
this objective is tracked daily to limit the amount of backorders and time to ship 
there has been a sustained high level of performance in the company s delivery metrics allowing it to obtain opportunities for market share expansion  especially with its electrical distributors and retail customers 
net sales for were million  or higher than the million net sales reported in much of the company s underlying markets  especially commercial  industrial and telecom construction  trended lower in compared with each of the business segments increased their net sales primarily through price increases  introduction of product line expansions or the expansion of market share 
lamson home products had the largest increase in net sales of million  which primarily reflects additional market share in non metallic electrical boxes at its major customer 
carlon introduced a key account management program  which helped to grow market share at strategic accounts 
while the pvc pipe business segment grew primarily from price increases that represented partial pass through of resin cost increases and growth in demand for its large diameter sewer pipe 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in raw material costs including pvc resin and compounds  hdpe resin and steel components climbed by more than double digit percentages in many of these increases were passed on during the year as sales price increases  except in the lamson home products business segment 
freight costs also escalated throughout due to fuel cost increases and driver and equipment shortages  lowering gross margin by 
the company was able as a whole to maintain  and slightly improve gross margins in compared with due to higher capacity utilization in versus in of the manufacturing facilities 
this occurred primarily in the hdpe extrusion plants as lines were run to keep up with the improving telecom demand 
lastly  the company continued to see favorable leveraging of its predominately fixed cost distribution operations where costs rose by approximately while shipping activity increased by almost 
gross profit in was million compared with million gross profit in gross margins were unfavorably impacted by higher raw material costs  of approximately million  that were not able to be completely recovered with price increases and higher employee benefit costs of million 
the manufacturing facilities experienced higher capacity utilization this year going from in to in the increase was primarily in the pvc and hdpe pipe extrusion facilities as the molding facilities have continuously run at consistently higher rates the last several years 
the overall cost of the company s supply chain  including distribution and freight costs  were higher in the current year by only  while the increased shipping activity rose in excess of 
this was caused by the distribution operations successfully focusing on improving bin accuracy  therefore  raising their productivity throughout the year 
meanwhile  freight costs are trending upward slightly  million  due to the rising fuel costs and carrier consolidations 
the company monitors key transportation metrics to attempt to control freight costs while still serving our customers 
operating income for was million  or of net sales  an increase of million  or over the million  or of net sales  earned in this improvement was primarily driven by the growing gross profit 
selling and marketing expenses reflect higher variable selling expenses generated in by the higher net sales levels 
in addition  incentive compensation is approximately million higher due to the significantly improved results this year  legal and professional fees exceeded levels by about thousand from incremental sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and expenditures made to support our announced strategic alternatives review 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in pension and retiree medical expense totaling million and the collection of a previously written off account receivable of million 
overall  operating expenses have declined to of net sales million in from of net sales million in included in operating results in were the net effects of a litigation settlement of million see note e and the sale and closure of the company s pasadena  texas facility see note m 
operating income in was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in this lower level of operating income was the result of the reduced gross profit in as operating expenses were down by million to million from million in selling and marketing costs declined primarily by favorable bad debt experience million in general and administrative costs were impacted by higher pension and retiree medical expense of million in these higher costs were offset by a significant decline in incentive compensation awards million as operating financial goals were  for the most part  not met in interest expense continued its downward trend in  declining to million from million in and million in both the average borrowings and interest rates that the company is paying have declined 
average borrowings were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the average interest rates were  and in  and  respectively 
while variable libor rates have increased  the company s average rate has improved as higher interest bearing term debt is being paid down and the company s interest rate spread under its secured credit agreement has declined in recent quarters as a result of improved leverage ratios 
the income tax provision for reflects an effective tax rate of compared with in and in the provision is primarily a non cash charge due to the company s net operating loss carry forward position 
during the company settled certain state tax matters which resulted in a reduction of the current state and local income tax expense by approximately thousand 
during the second quarter of  the company completed the transitional review for goodwill impairments required under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the review indicated that goodwill recorded in the telecom reporting unit of the carlon business segment was impaired as of the beginning of fiscal accordingly  the company measured and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million million after tax 
this has been recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations see note b 
no impairment was noted in subsequent tests in  or due to improved operating conditions and projected telecom market activity in the telecom reporting unit of the carlon business segment 
business segments carlon net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  over the million net sales level in approximately million of the increase came from the strong rebound in telecom product sales 
this market demand expansion of almost over is primarily due to the increased rollout of fiber to the premise projects  which utilize hdpe conduit 
carlon was able to raise pricing in in response to the higher raw material resin costs being incurred  which resulted in approximately million higher net sales than finally  the carlon business segment net sales were supported by a steady residential construction market and a slow upturn in non residential construction activity late in net sales in the carlon business segment increased by million a increase to million in from million in the entire increase came from higher sales of electrical products as the telecom product sales remained relatively flat in carlon introduced a key account management program in with the objectives of focusing on selling and marketing  along with other support services  on strategic accounts that have higher long term growth potential 
this effort increased net sales by approximately million while selective product line expansions added million in net sales in other than residential construction  which continued its double digit growth  the markets serviced by carlon including commercial  industrial and telecom construction continued their contraction in as businesses put off new investments 
gross margin has expanded throughout with the higher telecom sales volume and the price increases on electrical products that were realized this year 
plant utilization of the hdpe conduit facilities was about five points higher than the sales volume increase also helped carlon realize benefits from leveraging fixed costs  especially in the company s distribution centers 
gross margins in were adversely affected in this business segment as raw material cost increases  primarily pvc and hdpe resins  were not able to be fully passed on as higher selling prices 
this business segment is impacted by capacity utilization primarily in the molding and hdpe extrusion facilities 
the molding facilities continued to experience good utilization  exceeding an average of for the hdpe extrusion facilities  while recording better utilization in  still are using less than of their available capacity 
operating income for carlon was million  of net sales  in compared with million  of net sales in  an increase of million or 
included in operating income in is a charge of approximately  for this business segment s share of a litigation settlement see notes e and l 
the growth in operating income comes primarily from the higher net sales and resultant higher gross margins  which were offset slightly by increased variable selling expenses of million 
the operating income for this business segment fell in to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in actual operating expenses were lower by million in as the business segment implemented cost containment programs and had million less in bad debt expenses during the year 
the entire decline in operating margins came from higher cost of sales as described above 
lamson home products net sales in the lamson home products business segment continued its steady rise reaching million in  a million or increase over the million in net sales level in the underlying economics of the do it yourself home improvement market remains very solid  supported by strong existing and new home sales and low interest rates 
in addition  the company has maintained its high level of operational performance this year 
the net sales in include the full year impact of the additional market share obtained in mid of approximately million 
lamson home products has added its door chimes product line to a couple of major retail customers in the second half of impacting net sales by million 
none of the net sales growth in is attributable to price increases despite the significant cost increases absorbed in net sales in for lamson home products was favorably impacted by strong existing home sales  low interest rates and rising consumer confidence  increasing its net sales to million  a million  or increase  over the million in net sales in various supply chain initiatives were undertaken over the last several years  including leveraging the company s enterprise resource planning system  have resulted in fill rates the number of order line items filled with the first shipment that average above for the entire year 
the operational performance  along with innovation on new products and product line expansions  resulted in this business segment gaining additional market share totaling million with various customers 
in particular  lamson home products was named sole source for all of home depot s non metallic electric box business in mid the rollout of this additional business was substantially complete at the year end 
lamson home products segment gross margins were affected unfavorably by the over increase in pvc compound cost during as indicated above  no selling price increases were obtained from the retail customer base to offset these cost increases causing an erosion of over basis points of gross margin 
in addition  higher distribution expenses were incurred in  million  from the substantial increased volume of shipments 
lamson home products was unable to pass through the higher raw material costs realized in however  through the evolution of sales mix to higher margin products  the continued favorable utilization of the molding facilities that support this business segment and the spreading of relatively fixed distribution costs over higher volume  lamson home products was able to maintain gross margins at approximately the same rate as operating income was million  of net sales in  compared with million  of net sales  in the million decline in operating income comes primarily from reduced gross margins 
in addition  like carlon  this business segment was charged with  for its share of a litigation settlement in see notes e and l 
lamson home products also incurred higher variable selling expenses  million  and product development costs  million  to support  the expansion of the chimes and lighting control product lines 
the business segment realized million  or of net sales  in operating income in  an increase of million  or over the operating income of million  or of net sales 
operating expenses for this segment remained fairly steady with as higher variable selling and marketing expenses were offset by lower incentive compensation expense 
pvc pipe the pvc pipe business segment experienced net sales growth of million  or  to million in from million in rigid pipe sales volume was very strong in the fourth quarter of exceeding the fourth quarter by and bringing total year volume of pounds sold in approximately even with non residential and telecom infrastructure construction spending began rebounding late in the year while residential construction activity was healthy throughout this business segment was able to raise pricing by around in  which helped to offset pvc resin cost increases 
finally  this segment experienced higher sales  million  of the vylon large diameter sewer pipe products to support several sewer infrastructure projects 
the year was a difficult one for the pvc pipe business segment  as the commercial  industrial and telecom construction markets continued their downward trend 
the majority of the company s pipe pounds are sold into these markets while the strong residential construction market consumes smaller pipe sizes and thus  a lower percentage of volume 
total pvc resin pounds sold in was down approximately from while pricing was up an average of over the prior year 
overall  the pvc pipe business segment increased net sales in to million from million  a rise of million  or 
as part of the pvc pipe business  lamson vylon pipe  was able to produce additional net sales of million in by introducing small diameter sizes of sewer pipe 
gross margins in the pvc pipe business segment improved in as net sales prices increased to offset much of the approximate increase in resin costs 
in addition  the segment experienced favorable product mix  with vylon pipe and telecommunication duct becoming a higher percentage of sales 
finally  the segment has begun to realize some of the cost savings from capital investments made to increase productivity and reduce costs  such as the blend plant additions and automation projects completed in gross margins in eroded in this business segment as resin costs averaged higher than in  while only about a third of this cost increase was able to be recovered as a price increase from customers 
on a positive note  the pvc pipe extrusion facilities increased their capacity utilization by almost five basis points due to the reduction of pvc inventory in operating results for the pvc pipe business were greatly improved in the operating loss was narrowed from a million loss  of net sales  in to million loss  of net sales  in this improvement comes primarily from better gross margins as operating expenses have increased this year as a result of higher variable selling expenses 
operating expenses in for the pvc pipe segment remained fairly constant with the prior year while the operating loss for totaled million versus a million loss in due to lower gross profit levels 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources is cash generated from operating activities and availability under its secured credit agreement 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared with million in and million in despite improved operating results in  cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable primarily from exceptionally high fourth quarter net sales in accounts receivable at the end of totaled million compared with million at the end of days sales outstanding improved at year end representing days down from days and days at and year end  respectively 
inventories at the end of were higher by million  at million  up from the million year end balance 
in both and inventory balances declined by million and million  respectively 
due to the higher sales levels in  inventory turns continued to improve to times from times in and times in the pounds of pvc resin inventory at january  are approximately the same as the prior year  however  the cost per pound is higher than such costs at january  which itself had risen by over compared with the cost per pound at year end 
hdpe per pound resin costs in inventory at january  have also increased by over since the beginning of the year 
the company is investing more in inventory this year to support the dramatic increase in telecom product sales and for the rollout of additional chimes and lighting control sales to several retail customers 
the inventory increase in was offset by higher accounts payable balances 
due to the timing of the year end december   a number of payments of certain vendor liabilities were made in  primarily resin and lease payments  compared with or the company made cash contributions of million to support pension and other post retirement benefit plans in million in  primarily either into pension plan trust funds or for retiree medical payments 
in  contributions totaled million as the company made a discretionary million voluntary contribution to its defined benefit pension plans in order to more fully fund the plans after the significant decline in pension asset market values 
the company s cash used in investing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures declined slightly this year to million after investing million in addition in  of which million was spent improving the supply chain by adding blend plants at two extrusion facilities 
the current year s capital expenditures were spent on replacement and upgrading of molds and extrusion equipment  continued factory automation and tooling and molds for product line expansions 
in  the company also received million proceeds from the sale of fixed assets  primarily the pasadena  texas plant 
the company s cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the company was able to pay down million on the secured credit agreement as the company refinanced its corporate headquarters and reduced the investment in accounts receivable and inventories with the decline in business volume 
in the last two years  a total of million was paid to reduce the outstanding debt on the secured credit agreement  a slower pay down rate from  as the company has increased the amount invested in working capital to support the growth in business 
the company continues to have adequate credit capacity with availability of million at january   which is adequate to fund the seasonal needs of the business 
at the end of  the company s leverage ratio of did not meet the required covenant level of 
the company has received a waiver for this deficiency and an amendment to increase the leverage ratio to  which reflects current and future working capital requirements 
the company was in compliance with all other debt covenants at january  and is expected to maintain compliance throughout the remainder of the term of the agreement 
despite not meeting the covenant requirement  the company did lower its leverage ratio  which will  in turn  be reflected as a basis point decline in the secured credit agreement interest rate during the first quarter as noted earlier  the company s secured credit agreement matures in august the company does not expect any difficulty in refinancing this obligation in the first half of  subject to the outcome of the strategic review 
cash from operating activities  along with the current and planned refinancing of credit facilities  will be adequate to fund future cash flow requirements 
lastly  in  due to rising stock prices  the company received million as  shares were issued from the exercise of stock options 
outlook for in  particularly during the second half of the year  the telecom spending on fiber to the premise projects grew rapidly 
verizon announced that they were connecting a million homes with fiber optic cable in and at least million homes in meanwhile  sbc has also announced major anticipated investments in their fiber to the premise project initiatives for the next several years 
carlon  as the largest supplier of hdpe conduit in north america for the major telecom customers telephone and cable companies  is poised to benefit  as we did in  from this build out of the last mile of the telecom network 
despite increasing telecom sales by in  the company still has about of the capacity in its hdpe plants available to meet this forecasted growth in demand 
residential construction remained unexpectedly strong in with housing starts reaching almost million units added for the year  a increase in construction value over projections for are for a slight downturn in the number of units started to million  which is still a solid level 
existing home sales  a key driver in sales activity in the lamson home products business segment  climbed to nearly million units sold in  up from the levels 
it is anticipated that home sales will remain at healthy levels in as unemployment rates decline and interest rates increase modestly 
commercial and industrial construction  as expected  improved only slightly in some increase in net sales was realized by the company through carlon s key account program 
we anticipate that commercial and industrial construction will begin to experience a recovery in as corporate profits and  therefore  investments rise and the unemployment rates drop 
in addition  the broad growth in residential construction over the last few years should spur the need for additional commercial construction 
any increase in commercial or industrial construction will benefit the carlon and pvc pipe segments 
due to increased global and domestic demand  along with tight supply of feedstocks and high oil and gas prices  pvc and hdpe resins ended on average to higher than the end of with a strong outlook for the general economy in and resin producer operating rates over with no significant capacity net additions planned  the cost of resin is forecasted to be another to higher in all three business segments  including lamson home products for the first time  have announced price increases going into in order to mitigate these continuing rising costs 
with the closure of the pasadena  texas plant in  the company anticipates realizing about million to million in cost improvements in management continues to look for productivity improvements in order to reduce the company s cost structure 
capital spending in is expected to be to million  focused primarily on equipment additions and upgrades  incremental tooling to support telecom growth and new products 
cash flow from operating activities will continue to improve in from expected higher operating results and the leveling off of working capital requirements 
the company s secured credit agreement is scheduled to expire in august it is management s intent to replace the facility in the first half of  subject to the conclusion of the review of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  which may include the sale of part or all of the company 
this evaluation is expected to conclude by the end of the first quarter of the company does not anticipate any further covenant violations through the term of the debt 
in summary  we estimate that net sales in will increase to to a range of million to million  reflecting the strengthening conditions in the telecom  commercial and industrial construction markets 
based on this projected net sales growth and higher operating capacity utilization  the company anticipates that net income will rise to a range of to million  or to per diluted share in  a to improvement over results 
for the first quarter of  the company estimates that net sales should grow to a range of million to million  an increase of to over the first quarter of this improved level of net sales may result in net income of million to million  or cents to cents per diluted share in the first quarter of critical accounting policies the company is required to make estimates and judgments in the preparation of its financial statements 
these estimates and judgments affect the asset and liability amounts reported  as well as revenues and expenses and other disclosures 
the company routinely reviews these estimates and the underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances 
changes in estimates or judgments by management could have a significant impact on the company s financial results 
the company believes the following are the most significant accounting polices  which utilize estimates that are inherently uncertain and  therefore  based on management s judgment 
accounts receivable allowances the company maintains allowances against accounts receivable for amounts that may come uncollectible in the future 
the company records reserves for bad debt based on a variety of factors including customer s operating results and financial condition  the length of time receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  the company may be required to record additional bad debt allowances 
the company also has a significant volume of customer deductions  as is customary in the retail and electrical product markets 
these deductions primarily relate to pricing  freight and shipment quantity discrepancies 
the company strives to resolve these discrepancies on a timely basis to limit the accounts receivable collectibility issues 
estimates are made by management  based primarily on historical experience  as to the collectibility of deductions 
historically  except for the recovery of accounts receivables written off due to bankruptcies  there have not been material changes in estimates to the accounts receivable allowance 
inventory valuation the company routinely evaluates its inventories to ensure they are carried at lower cost or market value and to identify obsolete or excess inventory 
a sudden decline in pvc or hdpe resin costs  coupled with a slow down in sales volume  could result in the write down of inventory valuations 
in recent years  resin prices and end markets have improved resulting in no inventory valuation write downs 
in addition  with some of the supply chain improvements made in the last couple of years  the company carries less than two months worth of resin in inventory  which helps to mitigate the risk of write downs 
reserves are provided for obsolete and excess inventory by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual quantities on hand 
the total reserve at january  is million and has remained fairly consistent from year to year 
much of the company s products  when scrapped  can be re ground and the material put back into the manufacturing process 
there has not been a significant change in estimates relating to this inventory reserve in the last several years 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans the measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other post retirement benefits is impacted by management s assumptions related to discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases and healthcare trend rates 
variations in the pension plan assumptions including changes in discount rates  actual pension plan asset performance and actual compensation rate increases will either increase or decrease the unamortized actuarial gains or losses  which affects future pension expense 
the company currently has a million unrecognized actuarial loss for its defined benefit pension plans 
this is primarily the result of lower discount rates  going from in to in  which impacted the funded status by approximately million in this time period 
the current discount rate was selected by management based on an analysis of expected future interest rates that would be incurred to settle this liability 
the remainder of the unrecognized loss is caused by net asset actuarial loss actual return was less than the assumed rate of return of about million since the plans incurred actuarial loss of million in and reflecting the reduction in stock market equity values 
in and  the company has experienced million of actuarial asset gains as the stock market has rebounded and exceeded management s expected rate of return 
as of january   the expected rate of return on plan assets is  down from in this is the rate of return anticipated by management in the long term  based on plan asset mix 
the salary rate of increase is estimated to be and has over the past few years  been representative of actual results 
likewise  variations between actual and estimated healthcare trend rates will affect retiree medical expense in the future see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental and legal obligations management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for environmental cleanup and litigation 
liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of matters such as changes in laws  regulations and their interpretation  the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination  and improvements in technology 
at january  the company has million accrued for environmental matters at a property sold by the company in the liability is re estimated periodically and includes the costs of certain remediation activities which are anticipated to take place over an extended period of time 
based on the current year updated study  the company recognized a million change in estimate  reducing this reserve 
historically  there have not been any material changes in estimates see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
actual litigation costs can vary from estimates  based on the facts and circumstances and application of laws in individual cases 
at january  the company did not have any unsettled litigation that required accrual 
during  the company settled a patent infringement case with the net effect of the settlement of million reflected in the operating results see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets as of january   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  including loss carryforwards that expire through and other temporary differences 
significant factors considered by management in the determination of the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets include historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the extended period of time over which tax deductible goodwill is amortized and other post retirement medical benefits will be paid 
the company would need to generate approximately million in taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforward to in order to realize the benefits on its tax return 
the company has never had a net operating loss carryforward expire without being used 
current expectations of operating results are sufficient to sustain realization of these net assets 
however  should taxable income estimates for the carryforward period be significantly reduced  the full realization of net deferred tax assets may not occur 
at january  and january  the company had a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets to reflect management s assessment that a portion of the company s million general business tax credits  which expire in and  have a low probability of being realized 
goodwill valuation as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has goodwill of million  the majority of which relates to the telecom reporting unit in the carlon business segment 
an annual impairment test of goodwill is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter  or more frequently as conditions warrant 
the latest test as of october  resulted in no impairment 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the telecom reporting unit 
inherent in such fair value determinations  which use both discontinued cash flow and market multiple methodologies  are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material write down of goodwill 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities known as special purpose entities spes 
in the ordinary course of business  the company leases certain real properties and equipment with unrelated third parties as disclosed in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of january  payment due by period total to to after dollars in thousands contractual obligations long term debt obligations      capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations other long term liabilities  total      forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those expected as a result of a variety of factors  such as i the impact  outcome and effects of the company s exploration of strategic alternatives  ii the volatility of resin pricing  iii the ability of the company to pass through raw material cost increases to its customers  iv maintaining a stable level of housing starts  telecommunications infrastructure spending  consumer confidence and general construction trends  v the continued availability and reasonable terms of bank financing and vi any adverse change in the recovery trend of the country s general economic condition affecting the markets for the company s products 
because forward looking statements are based on a number of beliefs  estimates and assumptions by management that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate  there is no assurance that any forward looking statement will prove to be accurate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to commodity prices for pvc and hdpe resins and changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products include pvc and hdpe resins and compounds 
the company s financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials 
the company closely monitors its inventory levels and requirements for these materials and utilizes multiple suppliers where possible 
the company does not actively hedge or use derivative instruments in the management of its inventories 
the company s secured credit agreement obligation bears interest at a variable rate 
in order to mitigate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations  in the first quarter of  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flow to be exchanged and does not represent exposure to credit loss
