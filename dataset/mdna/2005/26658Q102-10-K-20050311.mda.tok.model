overview we operate in a complex environment due to the nature of our customers and our projects 
these factors are described throughout this annual report on form k  including under risk factors 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of overall risk  revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
depending on the contract  this poses challenges to our executive management team in overseeing contract performance and in evaluating the timing of the recognition of revenues and project costs  both initially and when there is a change in project status 
thus  our executive management team spends considerable time in evaluating and structuring key contracts  in monitoring project performance  and in assessing the financial impact of many of our contracts 
due to the complexity in the revenue recognition for our projects  executive financial management is particularly attentive to developments in individual contracts that may affect the timing of revenues and related costs 
the following is a summary of significant events in that had an impact on our financial results and thus received considerable financial management attention and scrutiny revenues earned from a site decontamination and decommissioning d d contract that was terminated for convenience and resulted in a favorable settlement of million 
the successful negotiation and recovery of sales tax paid for the years  net of expenses  of million 
the approvals of requests for equitable adjustments relating to the environmental management waste management facility emwmf project totaling million 
reduction in the effective tax rate to in from in as a result of lower state income tax  which resulted in a lower tax provision of million 
business development costs relating to the focus on international expansion prospects of million 
reduction in the incentive fee realized on the project hanford management contract in of million relating to uncontrollable prime contractor safety and performance shortfalls 
higher interest expense of million in due to the higher debt balance as a result of the establishment of a new credit facility in connection with the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock repurchase transaction in december  net of the prepayments totaling million 
we continue to actively manage our projects to minimize these risks and the financial impact on us 
more information on risks and our efforts to manage risks are available in item of this annual report 
we provide services to commercial and government customers in the united states that ensures safe and secure radioactive materials disposition and nuclear facility operations 
we possess a breadth of capabilities  technologies  assets  facilities  and qualified technical personnel that enable us to provide a full array of safe and secure radioactive materials disposition services 
our services include decommissioning services  nuclear facility operations  radioactive material characterization  processing  transportation  accident containment and restoration services  and final disposal 
our operations are organized into three primary segments i federal services  ii commercial services  and iii commercial processing and disposal 
our revenues are derived almost equally from government and commercial customers 
our federal services segment provides the following services as a contractor or subcontractor for the united states department of energy doe and other governmental entities radioactive and hazardous waste characterization  storage  processing  packaging  transportation  and disposal services  nuclear facility commissioning  operations  and decommissioning  technology and engineering expertise  and on site environmental remediation services on large government projects 
the timing and scope of doe waste treatment projects will affect future operating results 
these projects are typically approved and awarded when funding has been appropriated as part of the federal government s annual budget process 
most of these projects are long term and are required as part of environmental legislation 
however  these projects are continually at risk of funding adjustments depending on the federal government s current financial resources 
our commercial services segment provides a broad range of proven technologies and services to nuclear power plants  government and industrial facilities  universities  and research pharmaceutical laboratories 
our services include the following on site liquid and solid waste processing  transportation logistics including casks  brokerage services  and large component disposition  radiological emergency response  area  building  and site characterization and decommissioning  instrumentation calibration and rental  and training transportation  regulatory compliance environmental  safety  and health 
we also provide technical support services to our commercial clients including project management  engineering  radiation protection support  and environmental consulting 
these projects are typically approved and awarded by the respective commercial customer when funding has been appropriated as part of their annual budget process 
most of these projects are short term  however  these projects are continually at risk of funding adjustments depending on the commercial customer s current financial resources 
our commercial processing and disposal segment operates two facilities in tennessee and two facilities in south carolina 
at the tennessee facilities  we use multiple technologies to volume reduce and package customer waste for final disposition such as incineration  compaction  metal melting and decontamination  and survey and release 
future operating results will be affected by  among other things  the duration of commercial waste processing contracts and the amount of waste to be processed by our commercial waste processing operations pursuant to these contracts 
at our south carolina facilities  we perform the following operations operate a low level radioactive waste disposal facility in barnwell  south carolina for the state of south carolina  materials processing and packaging for disposal  and specialty waste processing for nuclear power plants 
we measure financial performance for each operating segment based on income from operations  which consists of revenues less direct expenses and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses for each segment includes specific expenses for the management  support  and business development functions of the segment as well as an allocation of our corporate sg a expense 
our corporate sg a expenses include company wide management  support  and business development functions and are allocated to each segment based on their pro rata share of direct expenses incurred 
we have included in this item a comparative period to period analysis of sg a expenses incurred by each segment and the impact of corporate sg a expense that has been allocated to each segment  and an analysis of corporate sg a expense 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to cost to complete long term contracts  the cost to d d facilities and equipment  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex  or subjective judgments 
our most critical accounting policies  which relate to revenue recognition  d d liabilities  and recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill  are discussed below 
revenue recognition contract revenue and cost recognition we have contracts to provide engineering and technical support services to the federal government and its agencies and to commercial companies 
our federal government contracts are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or periodically throughout the term of the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on customer direction pending a request for equitable adjustment rea or finalization and signing of formal funding documents 
we have an internal process for approving such work 
our services are provided under time and materials  cost plus award or incentive fee  firm fixed price  and fixed unit rate contracts 
as of december   based on revenues  we had of time and materials contracts  of cost plus award or incentive fee contracts  of firm fixed price contracts  and of fixed unit rate contracts 
the following describes our policies for these contract types time and materials contracts we are paid for labor and costs incurred at negotiated contractual rates 
profitability on these contracts is driven by the extent of utilization of our billable personnel and cost control 
cost plus award or incentive fee contracts we are reimbursed for allowable costs and fees  which may be fixed or performance based 
if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or any applicable regulations  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs 
we are awarded incentive fees if we meet certain contract commitments  including schedule  budget  and safety 
if any of these commitments are not satisfied  we could have a reduction in expected revenues 
quarterly assessments are made to measure our compliance with established contract commitments 
we receive award and incentive fees on certain federal government contracts  which are accrued when estimable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we recognized million in incentive fee revenues in  million in  and million in included in the incentive fee recognized is an incentive fee on a federal government subcontract on the fernald closure project that is not billable until the project is complete  which is currently estimated to be may as of december  the amount of unbilled incentive fee is million and as of december  it is million 
firm fixed price and fixed unit rate contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and  consequently  we are exposed to a number of risks 
these risks include underestimation of costs  problems with new technologies  unforeseen costs or difficulties  delays beyond our control  and economic and other changes that may occur during the contract period 
for firm fixed price contracts  our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  and is based on the proportion of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs or units of production 
for fixed unit rate contracts  our revenues are recognized as units are completed based on the contractual unit rates 
we record contract claims and pending change orders  including requests for equitable adjustment  when revenue is probable  which generally is when accepted in writing by the customer 
the cost to perform the work related to these claims and pending change orders  including requests for equitable adjustments  is included in our estimates of contract profitability 
as of december   there are approximately million outstanding requests for equitable adjustments in federal services and approximately million outstanding in commercial services related to scope changes or contract negotiations 
as of december   no amount of these claims has been included in the contract value 
subcontractors have requested contract change orders totaling approximately million related to scope changes requested by our customers where we have made identical claims to the customers 
based on agreement with our customers and our understanding of the contracts  recovery by these subcontractors is contingent upon our recovery from our customers 
these amounts have not been included in the results of our operations 
provision for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the losses are identified and include all estimated direct costs to complete the contract excludes future general and administrative costs expected to be allocated to the contract 
contract acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
contracts typically provide for periodic billings on a monthly basis or based on contract milestones 
cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents amounts recognized as revenue that have not been billed 
unearned revenue represents amounts billed and collected for which revenue has not been recognized 
as of december   we have unbilled receivables for commercial services and federal services segments of million of which million related to work performed that is currently billable and deferred revenues for the commercial services and federal services segments of million for cash collections in advance of performance of services 
as of december   we have unbilled receivables for commercial services and federal services segments of million of which million related to work performed that is currently billable and deferred revenues for the commercial services and federal services segments of million for cash collections in advance of performance of services 
revisions in revenues  cost  and profit estimates  or measurements in the extent of progress toward completion are changes in accounting estimates accounted for in the period of change cumulative catch up method 
such revisions could occur at any time and the effects could be material 
although we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion of contract revenue and of contract completion costs on our long term engineering and construction contracts  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates  and it is possible that such variances could be material to our operating results 
commercial waste processing the commercial waste processing operations have contracts with commercial companies and governmental agencies to provide waste processing services 
our services are provided primarily under fixed unit price contracts and usually require us to ship the processed waste for burial on behalf of the customer 
our value added service is volume reduction of contaminated materials to reduce the economic costs of burial 
revenue is recognized as units of waste are processed based on the unit prices quoted in the contracts 
our fixed unit price contracts provide for additional customer billings if the characterization of waste received is different from contract specifications or for certain increases in burial costs  both of which are estimated at the time waste is received and sorted 
as of december   we have unbilled receivables of million related to work performed that is billable upon completion of work and deferred revenues of million for cash collections in advance of our performance of service 
as of december   we had unbilled receivables of million related to work performed that was billable upon completion of work and deferred revenues of million for cash collections in advance of our performance of service 
sometimes variances in weight and waste classification occur 
these variances are identified when the waste is sorted and during the processing cycle and can have either a positive or negative impact on revenue  depending on the contract 
when these variances are identified  rate is adjusted to the correct weight or classification assuming the contract allows for such an adjustment 
disposal revenues from the operation of a low level radioactive waste disposal facility in barnwell  south carolina are recognized in accordance with the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act the atlantic waste compact act 
under the atlantic waste compact act  we are reimbursed for allowable costs incurred in operating the site that are identified by the south carolina public service commission and incurred by us plus an operating margin of on certain of those allowable costs 
in addition  costs incurred for decommissioning activities at the site are reimbursed by the state of south carolina from a trust fund established to cover the barnwell closure obligation 
we receive a operating margin on these costs 
our results from july  forward are based on the economic regulation imposed by the atlantic waste compact act 
d d liabilities we have responsibility related to the cost to d d the facilities and equipment in tennessee and south carolina and equipment used at customer sites in the commercial services segment 
such costs will generally be paid upon closure of such facilities or disposal of such equipment 
similarly  under our license granted by the state of south carolina and the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act  we will be obligated for costs associated with the ultimate closure of the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility in south carolina and its buildings and equipment located at the barnwell site 
we have recorded accruals related to these d d liabilities 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation aro as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the asset 
we are also required to record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  the aro will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 on january   we recognized the following changes to our consolidated financial statements increase property  plant and equipment by million and increase facility and equipment d d liabilities by million 
we recognized a million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of tax million pre tax 
as of december   our d d liabilities consist of facility and equipment aro of million and barnwell closure of million 
under the terms of the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act the atlantic waste compact act  and our license with the state of south carolina  we were required to establish a trust fund to cover the barnwell closure obligation  which limits our obligation to the amount of trust fund 
we update our closure and remediation cost estimates for d d on an annual basis 
these estimates are based on current technology  regulations  and burial rates 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact that changes in technology  regulations  and burial rates will have on the ultimate costs 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on these estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill and million of intangible assets with estimable useful lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not have any other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
we tested our goodwill at the end of the first quarter of   and in accordance with the standard and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of excess carrying value over fair value 
during   and  we concluded that no impairment charge was required

a contract loss was recognized on the emwmf contract in the third quarter of  and resulted in an adjustment to reduce revenues relating to the secondary phase on this contract by approximately million 
the adjustment resulted from a reassessment of the project s status  which was required primarily due to an increase in cost estimates to operate the facility due to excessive weather related conditions at the emwmf site

this project is a cost plus incentive fee contract that includes schedule and cost driven performance incentives over approximately a seven year period 
a large portion of the incentive fee is not billable until the project is complete  which is currently estimated to be may as of december   we have unbilled amounts that will not be collected within the next months of million related to the difference between costs incurred and fee earned on the project as compared to the agreed upon billing schedule 
the risks associated with this contract relate to the timely receipt by our customer of their funding and the estimated completion target date  which is the basis for the recognition of the incentive fee 
we are recognizing this incentive fee at the estimated target completion date utilized by the prime contractor and believe that collection of these amounts are reasonably assured 
requests of equitable adjustments of million approved in june on a commercial services segment contract that cannot be billed until the contract modification has been received  amounts that are billable relating to emergency response work performed by the commercial services segment  amounts billable on federal government contracts  and an increase in amounts billable on fixed unit rate contracts due to an increase in units processed

under south carolina law  we are required to bill customers based on the disposal rates agreed upon by the state 
on an annual basis  following the state s fiscal year end on june  we remit amounts billed to and paid by customers of the waste disposal site less our fee for operating the site during such fiscal year 
in july  we remitted million to the state of south carolina 
at december   we owed net amounts of approximately million to the state of south carolina relating to the operations of the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility 
cash used for estimated income tax payments and accrued project costs  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued operating expenses 
a decrease in unearned revenues primarily due to the timing of receipts of advance payments from customers of our fixed based processing facility in tennessee and the processing of the waste from these customers  a decrease in the indirect cost rates due to the release of contract based reserves relating to billable rates  and a decrease in the amount of advance payments received in the cs operation

the repurchase transaction improved our near term cash flow by reducing the dividends on the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock and replacing them with lower cost debt capital

during  we also used million in cash for transaction costs and related expenses incurred in connection with an amendment to the existing bank credit facility 
historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been for debt service under our bank credit facilities  for working capital requirements  and for acquisitions 
we have funded these requirements primarily through internally generated operating cash flows and funds borrowed under our bank credit facilities  and we expect this to continue in on december   in connection with the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock repurchase transaction  we entered into a new bank credit facility 
as of december   the bank facility consisted of a million revolving line of credit  including a million sub limit for the issuance of standby letters of credit  to fund working capital requirements and a six year million term loan 
proceeds of the term loan were used to repay million of existing term debt under our prior credit facility and to repurchase  shares of the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock for million in cash plus accrued and unpaid dividends of million  net of transaction costs and related expenses 
in addition  we also paid million in dividends during the year for a total of million in dividends for in connection with the bank credit facility  we paid million in transaction financing costs and related expenses 
the costs were deferred and are being amortized to expense over the term of the bank credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  london interbank offered rates libor plus an applicable margin 
during  the applicable margin on borrowings under the term loan were for prime rate loans and for libor loans 
effective february   the bank credit facility was amended to lower the applicable margin on borrowings under the bank credit facility 
for term loans  the applicable margin is for prime rate loans and for libor loans 
for revolving loans  the applicable margin is determined based on our leverage ratio and can range from to for prime rate loans and from to for libor loans 
the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including net leverage  interest coverage  and fixed charge coverage ratios  and minimum levels of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends  other than on the remaining shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock  and limitations on our ability to make acquisitions 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit  million in outstanding letters of credit  and an million six year term loans bearing interest at libor plus 
as of december   the million in total available borrowings under the revolving line of credit were reduced by the million in outstanding letters of credit  for a net borrowing availability of million under the revolving line of credit 
we are required to post  from time to time  standby letters of credit and surety bonds to meet certain customer contract requirements 
we do not directly post financial assurance instruments or other guarantees for our subcontractors 
as of december   we had outstanding assurance instruments of million  consisting of million in letters of credit and million in surety bonds  which expire at various contract completion dates 
we have entered into certain indemnification agreements with the providers of the surety bonds  which would require funding only if we failed to perform under the contracts being insured and the surety bond issuer was obligated to make payment to the insured parties 
the letters of credit are issued under our bank credit agreement up to million as a sublimit to the million revolving line of credit

b see note to consolidated financial statements 
c the liability to the state of south carolina is based on amounts billed and paid by customers of the waste disposal site less our fee for operating this site 
the amount collected and the fee are based on volume of waste disposed  therefore it cannot be accurately estimated 
d we generally do not make unconditional  noncancellable purchase commitments 
we enter into purchase orders that have a duration of less than one year in the normal course of business 
certain members of our senior management are subject to employment agreements with one year automatic extensions unless terminated with proper notice before the end date 
as of december   there were no contractual obligations associated with these employment agreements 
following the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock repurchase transaction in december  we had  shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock that remained outstanding with parties other than the carlyle group 
during  all these shares were converted into common stock at the option of the holders 
pursuant to a stockholders agreement with the carlyle group  we purchased the outstanding  shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock held by the carlyle group at a purchase price of per share during the fourth quarter of for approximately million 
we believe that cash flows from operations  cash resources at december  and  if necessary  borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating cash  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
over the longer term  our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive  and business factors 
depending upon market conditions  we may seek to supplement our capital resources with debt or equity financing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  letters of credit  and surety bonds as of december  see note new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for  and  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our major market risk relates to changing interest rates 
at december   we have floating rate long term debt of million  of which the current portion is million 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective on july  partially to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relating to our outstanding variable rate debt 
this interest rate swap agreement is not designated as a hedge 
the contract s aggregate notional amount was million at inception and declines each quarter over the life of the contract in proportion to our estimated outstanding balance of the related long term debt under the prior credit facility 
additionally  the credit facility requires us to have in place an interest rate protection arrangement for the aggregate notional amount of at least of the aggregate outstanding principle amount of the term loans until june  the contract s notional amount is million at december  under the terms of the contract  we pay a fixed rate of and receive libor  which resets every days 
the contract matures on june  the fair value of the contract at december  is approximately million 
this derivative financial instrument helps us manage our exposure to movements in interest rates by converting our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this contract locks in a fixed rate of interest with a pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap  thereby hedging exposure to the variability in market interest rate fluctuations 
we have implemented policies which restrict the usage of derivatives to non trading purposes 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility during the twelve months ended december  in addition  we do not have any material foreign currency or commodity risk 
a hypothetical interest rate change of on our bank credit facility would have changed interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million and the interest rate swap agreement would have changed interest expense by million in the opposite direction 
in addition  a hypothetical interest rate change of on our interest rate swap agreement would have changed the fair value of the interest swap at december  by approximately thousand 
additionally  changes in market interest rates would impact the fair value of our long term obligations 
the carrying amount of our indebtedness under our bank credit facility approximates its fair value as of december   as the facility bears interest rates that approximate the market
