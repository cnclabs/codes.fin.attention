table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
except for the historical financial information  many of the matters discussed in this item may be considered forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
many of the risks and uncertainties are described below under the caption risk factors 
overview we focus on providing enterprise wide pre emptive protection 
we provide such protection with our comprehensive line of products and services 
these include iss siteprotector centralized management system  a product family consisting of network and host intrusion prevention  integrated security appliances  desktop protection and vulnerability protection  and iss managed security services and professional security services 
the integrated security appliance includes  in addition to intrusion prevention  firewall  virtual private network  anti virus protection  content filtering and e mail security  including anti spam 
this combination of products and services forms our proventia enterprise security platform esp  which contributes to business process optimization by maintaining a delicate balance between it performance  availability and risk ultimately stopping cyber threats before they impact operations 
unlike traditional approaches to security  which focus on improving reaction times  proventia esp is designed to avoid security incidents by combining continuous vulnerability assessment and threat prevention with enterprise wide information management and reporting capabilities 
our objective is to enable companies to shield security vulnerabilities across their entire it infrastructure before attacks are released 
we currently plan to continue to evolve the proventia enterprise security platform by further automating enterprise security policy and delivering it within the context of existing it processes 
our managed services offerings currently provide remote management of our best of breed security technology  focusing on security assessment and intrusion detection  intrusion prevention and desktop protection systems  and include firewalls  vpns  anti virus and url filtering software 
we focus on serving as the trusted security provider to our customers by maintaining within our existing products the latest counter measures to security risks  creating new innovative products based on our customers needs and providing professional and managed services 
many factors will affect our future financial performance  especially our ability to differentiate our offerings from competitors that include much larger companies with greater marketing capabilities  financial resources and brand recognition 
in order to continue to create such differentiation  we expect to continue to expand our domestic and international sales and marketing operations  seek acquisition candidates and alliances with partners whose products  technologies or services capabilities are complementary to our solutions  and improve our internal operating and financial infrastructure in support of our strategic goals and objectives 
at the same time  we expect to adjust our organization size in light of changing economic conditions and maintain emphasis on controlling discretionary spending and capital expenditures 
while we believe in the long term success of our business solutions  our prospects must be considered in light of the recent experience  risks and difficulties that are frequently encountered by companies serving rapidly evolving markets 
see risk factors 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which 
table of contents management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue in the following categories product licenses and sales  which include revenue from sales of perpetual software licenses and products  subscription revenues  which include product support and content updates  term licenses  subscription licenses and managed service arrangements  and professional services revenues  which includes fee based service engagements and training 
we recognize software license revenue under statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product licenses and sales we recognize perpetual software license revenues  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  upon delivery of the software and issuance of the related license  assuming that no significant vendor obligations or customer acceptance rights exist 
where payment terms are extended over periods greater than twelve months  revenue is recognized as such amounts become due and payable 
revenue is also deferred when payment terms are extended for periods less than twelve months and such sales are deemed either not to be fixed or determinable or collection is not probable based on evaluation of all terms of the transaction 
product sales consist primarily of appliances sold in conjunction with iss licensed software 
these sales are recognized upon shipment to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria for software license revenue recognition are met 
sales of products are generated both through direct sales to end users as well as through various partners  including system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
revenue from product licenses and sales is recognized when the sale has occurred for an identified end user  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we offer evaluation software available via download from our website and evaluation units for appliance based products that allow potential customers to see the functionality of the products on their own networks prior to purchase 
at the point of delivery  the customer has no right of return 
subscription revenues renewable product support and content updates are separate components of product licenses and sales 
security monitoring and management services for information assets and systems are part of managed services and associated revenues are recognized and billed as such services are provided 
term licenses allow customers to use our products and receive product support coverage and content updates for a specified period  generally twelve months 
we generally invoice for product support  content updates and term licenses at the beginning of the term and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term 
historically  our appliance and software sales have been accounted for primarily as revenue at the time of sale  with product support and content updates generally representing between and of the license or product amount 
the majority of the initial price paid by the customer for certain proventia integrated security 
table of contents appliance models currently is for selected content blades  which customers acquire for a specified term that is recognized over such term as subscription revenue 
the company is considering changing the pricing model for our proventia integrated security appliances to our historical model 
under this model customers would acquire the appliance and all content blades  which would be recorded as product revenue in the period of sale  and pay annual support and content fee in the historical range of to of the product amount 
professional services revenues service engagements are typically billed on either a fixed fee or time and materials basis and primarily consist of security assessments of customer networks and the development of customers security policies 
these offerings are intended to support our goal of providing products and managed services 
we prefer to have our partners provide these services where practical 
we recognize such professional services revenues as the related services are rendered 
multiple elements arrangements our sales of product and or software licenses are multiple element arrangements that include product support and content updates and may include other subscription or professional services delivered after the product or software license 
revenue is generally recognizable before delivery of every element of the arrangement when all of the following requirements exist vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  the functionality of the delivered elements is not dependent on the undelivered elements  and delivery of the delivered elements represents the culmination of the earnings process 
we recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as product and license revenues 
we allocate revenue to the delivered products and licenses using the residual method 
under the residual method  we allocate discounts inherent in the arrangement to products and product support and content updates associated with products that are initially delivered and recognize the other elements as they are delivered based on the vsoe  which is determined based on transactions where the company sells those elements separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
allowance for doubtful accounts our sales are global  with customers located in the americas  emea  and asia pacific regions 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition and do not require collateral 
we provide for estimated credit losses as such losses become probable 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its liquidity or financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the best facts available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million  or of the million of total trade receivables 
this allowance of receivables reflects our practice to leave accounts on our general ledger and provide reserves pending final resolution of collectibility rather than to write off such accounts 
our bad debt expense for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million in and million in the provision for was a lower percentage of total revenues compared to due to the continued absence of any significant new identified exposures for the second straight year 
we continued to monitor the asia situation that contributed to the higher bad debt expense level in in january  a new distributor for china assumed the rights and the obligations of the distribution agreement for iss products from the old distributor 
in connection with this agreement  we modified the new distributor s obligations  which resulted in an additional  of bad debt expense recorded in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of and the write off of million against the allowance account 
we established a firm repayment schedule and have received timely payments under this schedule 
the remaining balance  which has been reduced to  at january   is scheduled to be paid in the first half of while actual credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our intangible assets may change in the future  which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently have goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles of approximately million  with million of goodwill related to our june acquisition of network ice corporation network ice and million of goodwill related to the january acquisition of cobion  a privately held company based in kassel  germany cobion 
the determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
we have concluded that this amount is realizable based on forecasted discounted cash flows through and on our stock market valuation 
neither method indicated that our goodwill had been impaired and  as a result  we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill during the year ended december  other intangibles of approximately million are principally acquired technology from the network ice and cobion acquisitions that are components in our current product offerings 
recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas statement no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values ie  pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
statement r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the company expects to adopt sfas r on july  sfas r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating these transition methods and the impact sfas r will have on the financial statements 
acquisitions we believe that our total solutions approach will positively impact all of our revenue categories 
this includes our products and managed services offerings  as well as product support  professional services and training 
while we expect the expansion of these product and service offerings to originate primarily from internal development  our strategy includes acquiring products  technologies and service capabilities that fit within our strategy and could potentially accelerate the timing of the commercial introduction of such products and technologies 

table of contents in january  we acquired cobion 
cobion provides content filtering and anti spam technology that protects individuals and enterprises against unwanted web content  spam  misuse of information and lost productivity 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash plus the direct costs of acquisition 
the cobion product continues to be sold on a stand alone basis and through oem relationships and is a component of our integrated security appliance 
in october  we completed the acquisition of privately held vcis  inc vcis of santa clara  california  a developer of patent pending  next generation  pre emptive behavioral inspection technology 
the technology prevents malicious code from executing and causing damage before it has an opportunity to interact with the enterprise network 
the aggregate purchase price was million and was primarily allocated to in process research and development 
in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and was required to be expensed at the time of acquisition under gaap 
as a result  we incurred an expense of million in the fourth quarter of of the remaining purchase price  million was allocated to the assembled workforce  which is being amortized over three years   was allocated to net tangible assets  principally fixed assets  and  of liabilities were assumed 
in the fourth quarter of we committed to a plan to close the research and development facility in sydney  australia  transferred knowledge of the product to our atlanta based personnel  and wrote off the remaining approximately  of the intangible asset related to the vcis workforce 
the closing of the sydney facility was completed in the first half of in august  internet security systems kk iss kk  our asia pacific subsidiary  acquired a distributor in singapore  trisecurity holdings pte ltd 
trisecurity 
trisecurity was the sole distributor for iss kk in southeast asia  including india  and its business was almost exclusively focused on iss solutions 
this acquisition provides our asia pacific subsidiary direct support capabilities for their customers in southeast asia and allows iss kk to expand its capabilities in this growing market 
the consideration consisted of  shares of iss kk stock and approximately million of cash 
goodwill of approximately million related to the purchase was recorded 
during the first quarter of  iss kk amended the agreement and agreed to make payment of shares of iss kk in each of the first quarters of and  relating to annual contingent consideration payments defined in the purchase agreement 
due to regulatory issues  the agreement was amended prior to the payment to make the and payments in cash in lieu of shares 
additional consideration of  was paid in february based on the fair market value of the shares  and is reflected in goodwill at december  
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated historical operating information  as a percentage of total revenues  for the periods indicated year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data product licenses and sales subscriptions professional services total revenues cost of revenues product licenses and sales amortization of acquired technology subscriptions and professional services total cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative charge for in process research and development amortization and write off of intangibles and stock based compensation total costs and expenses operating income revenues product licenses and sales since the second quarter of  we have offered the proventia family of network protection appliances that collectively provides unified  multi function protection capabilities designed to identify and prevent many forms of attack with minimal user intervention 
these products are designed to operate in demanding network environments while being easy to deploy  easy to use and centrally managed  all in an effort to make our solution more cost effective 
the market response has been dramatic as proventia grew from of product license and sales revenues in its year of introduction to in product licenses and sales increased by in from due to this positive market response to our proventia line  reversing a decreasing trend for the previous three years 
this revenue category decreased slightly to of total revenues in compared to in and in as subscription revenues continued to grow significantly 
our future growth is dependent on a continuation of the positive market response to our proventia family of products 
we expect to extend proventia to our server and pc desktop and laptop solutions delivered as software offerings 
our present product roadmap also focuses on product offerings and enhancements that will continue to improve central control and manageability  easier deployment and more refined information as well as broader proventia appliance offerings 
we expect that this focus will continue to make our products more cost effective to implement and maintain the goal of increasing the future level of product licenses and sales 
this expected growth is critical as it represents not only product and license revenues  but also subscription revenues from product support and content 

table of contents subscriptions subscription revenues consist of product support and content updates  security monitoring fees for managed services offerings  and term licenses of products 
subscriptions revenue represented of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in the largest component of subscription revenues  product content and support  remained comparable at of total revenues in and  up from of total revenues in product content and support includes hardware support of our proventia appliances  software updates and software blades  technical support and security content that includes advisory updates from x force  our internal team of security experts 
product content and support are provided to our customers through contracts executed with customers for a specified term and billed at the time of contract 
such billings are recorded as deferred revenues on our balance sheet and amortized as subscriptions revenue over the term of the contract 
we expect product content and support revenues to increase in the future as our client base that generates product content and support revenues expands 
managed services revenues increased to of total revenues in  as compared with in and in we believe these increases were due to a strong demand in the market for proven  financially sound  managed security service providers 
we are marketing managed services both directly to end users and through partners  including a number of new arrangements with integrators and service providers that include managed services as a part of their service offerings to their customers 
we also expect sales of managed services to continue to grow steadily as we focus our efforts on marketing offerings to new and existing customers that meet changing needs in today s environment 
professional services professional services revenue decreased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue to in from in and in we continue to focus on high value offerings that utilize our x force expertise  and look to our system integration and channel partners to serve as the primary resource to fulfill the services and education needs of our customers 
geographic regions geographically  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within the americas region 
revenues by region represented the following percentages of total revenues americas emea asia pacific while there have been changes in the proportion of revenues generated by each region  all of the regions experienced growth in revenues in revenues in emea benefited from volume growth combined with a strengthening currency throughout and  since products sold to emea customers are primarily sold in the euro currency 
the financial data for each segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
costs and expenses personnel personnel and related costs represent our largest expense category 
we ended with  employees  up from  at the beginning of the year 
there have been numerous minor adjustments within the organization during our research and development headcount experienced no net increase during despite the acquisition of cobion 
the majority of headcount growth occurred in quote carrying sales personnel  sales support and marketing 
our headcount has fluctuated between approximately  and 
table of contents over the last years as we acquired and integrated acquisitions and continually refined our business targets in light of economic conditions during these years 
we began to use restricted stock  in addition to stock options  as an equity component of compensation beginning in the first quarter of we recorded million of compensation expense associated with restricted stock in the expense categories in which the recipients are placed 
cost of product licenses and sales cost of product licenses and sales consists of several components 
the substantial portion of our cost of product licenses and sales in and represents the hardware cost of our proventia appliances 
we also licensed development source code in  which is being amortized as cost of products sold over its estimated useful life of four years 
in prior years  costs included payments to partners for their products that we sold or integrated with our managed service offerings 
costs associated with licensing our software products are minor 
as a percentage of product licenses and sales revenues  these costs increased from in to in and in the increase is attributable to the dramatic increase in proventia appliance revenues in these periods 
we also incurred million in  million in and million in of amortization expense related to core and developed technology that was recorded as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
cost of subscriptions and professional services cost of subscriptions and professional services includes the cost of our technical support personnel who provide assistance to customers under product support agreements  the security operations center soc costs of providing managed security monitoring services and the costs related to our professional services and training 
these costs were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of subscription and professional services revenues  the costs decreased to in from in and in cost efficiencies in the manner in which these services were delivered combined with the fact that our appliances require less technical support effort than our software products allowed the dollar amount of these expenses to remain relatively flat during a period of increasing subscription revenues 
costs associated with our technical support personnel and our security operations centers did increase each year in  and as we added personnel to handle additional customers 
we gained efficiencies in our soc s and restructured our support groups to be more productive so personnel increased at a much lower rate than revenue growth  contributing to the decrease in those costs as a percentage of total revenues 
additionally  our appliances typically require less technical support effort than our software products 
while we continue to seek increased productivity  we do expect some increase in costs with a continued increase in revenues in the future 
offsetting this increase in costs associated with our technical support personnel and our soc s was a decrease in costs associated with our professional services and education services commensurate with the decrease in the associated revenues 
research and development research and development expenses consist of salary and related costs of research and development personnel  including costs for employee benefits  and depreciation on computer equipment 
these costs include those associated with maintaining and expanding the x force  our internal team of security experts 
we believe our primary research and product development and managed service offerings are important to retaining our leadership position in the market 
we continue to add functionality to our product family  providing gateway  network  server and desktop based solutions  as well as to our security management applications 
these improvements as well as new offerings are intended to provide our customers with more powerful and easier to use solutions for security management across the enterprise 

table of contents research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in these costs fluctuated as a percentage of total revenues from in to in and in the increase in expense dollars is the result of additions to our headcount due to the addition of vcis in the fourth quarter of  cobion in the first quarter of and continued investment in our proventia line 
throughout and  we reorganized and consolidated our efforts for security content  protection agent frameworks  management infrastructure and multifunction appliance delivery to enhance operational and development efficiency 
this resulted in closing our engineering operations in reading  uk and sydney  australia in the fourth quarter of these exit costs  which totaled million  increased research and development expenses by of total revenues in in we continued to streamline our operations as we relocated some engineering functions from our california development facility to atlanta and offshore 
while we are committed to continue our investment in x force research and development capabilities  which we believe distinguishes iss from its competitors  we intend to seek leverage in future periods in the research and development area while enhancing current technologies and developing new technologies 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  travel expenses  commissions  advertising  maintenance of our website  trade show expenses  costs of recruiting sales and marketing personnel and costs of marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in in sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in we added quota carrying headcount in and had higher variable commission expense associated with higher product license and sales revenues  but gained leverage from our sales force as we continue to increase the percentage of sales fulfilled through the channel 
in  sales and marketing expenses decreased in both absolute dollars to million and as a percentage of total revenue to from in these decreases occurred as a result of a full year impact of sales headcount reductions as well as selective decreases during additionally  we incurred lower commissions due to the decrease in product license and sales revenues 
finally  marketing costs were at a lower level  as we did not continue our television and print advertising campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the iss brand 
we expect to continue to achieve leverage in our sales efforts by focusing our direct sales force on large customers that are served either directly by us or through large systems integrators 
our channel  which includes systems integrators  value added resellers and distributors  will continue to be of increasing importance to us  measured quantitatively by an increasing level of product revenue originating through the channel 
in the channel represented approximately of our sales as compared to in and in we intend to use its capabilities to reach larger customers through joint selling efforts and to reach departmental and small companies  especially for our proventia multi function appliance  which we believe has much more appeal to these companies 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses of million in  million in and million in  represented approximately of our total revenues in  in and in general and administrative expenses consist of personnel related costs for executive  administrative  finance and human resources  internal information systems and other support services costs  and legal  accounting and other professional service fees 
the largest increase in was approximately million for outside resources to assist in the design and execution of control testing related to financial control compliance work required by sarbanes oxley act section as well as the related audit costs 
amortization of restricted stock  as previously discussed  was also a new expense items in  which had the largest impact on this expense category 

table of contents included in expenses were non recurring expenses associated with a relocation of our asia pacific headquarters in tokyo 
costs included lease termination costs  including remaining rent payments  write off of leasehold improvements and moving costs 
these costs increased general and administrative expenses by of total revenues in charge for in process research and development we have reflected a charge of million in for the write off of in process research and development costs associated with the vcis acquisition in october in process research and development had not reached technological feasibility based on identifiable technological risk factors which indicated that even though successful completion was expected  it was not assured at the acquisition date and was immediately charged to operations 
amortization we incurred amortization expense related to intangible assets and stock based compensation of  in  million in and million in these intangible assets and stock based compensation resulted from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are amortized over their expected lives 
due to the closing of our reading  uk and sydney  australia research and development facilities in late  the expense in includes a  charge related to our workforce reductions at these facilities 
interest income interest income decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in interest income from to resulted from a drop in market rates of interest on our investment grade commercial paper and similar investments from approximately during to approximately during while the market rate of interest did increase slightly in to  interest income decreased in due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as we utilized available cash for our stock repurchase program and the january acquisition of cobion 
other income expense  net in other expense of  consisted primarily of minority interest expense of  and a write down of an investment made by our asia pacific subsidiary of approximately  partially offset by foreign exchange gains 
in and other income expense was primarily related to minority ownership investments by our japan subsidiary in a number of private companies  which ultimately produced a million realized gain in and a million impairment loss in provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in  million in and million in taxes paid generally relate to foreign operations 
income tax expense was recorded on domestic income for each year but taxes payable were reduced by deductions related to the value of employee exercise of stock options 
the tax benefit for the use of these stock option deductions was recorded as additional paid in capital 
the company has approximately million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available as offset against future us operations that expire between in various years ending with the company has net operating loss carryforwards  primarily from the emea region  totaling approximately million that can be used to offset future taxable income in the respective country 
these carryforwards can generally be carried forward indefinitely 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our financial position remained strong throughout our cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments at december  were million 
our investments in marketable securities consisted solely of high rated debt obligations either with maturities of twelve months or less or longer term investments with interest rates that are adjusted to current market rates no less frequently than quarterly 
during  we met our working capital needs and capital equipment needs with cash provided by operations 
cash provided by operations in totaled million compared to million in and million in the major components of cash flows provided by operating activities in were net income of million  non cash depreciation and amortization changes of million  income tax benefits of million from exercises of employee stock options and an increase in deferred revenues of million 
an important element of our liquidity is the collection of our accounts receivable 
these receivables totaled million at december  and had increased by million during we measure our accounts receivable management by our daily sales outstanding 
this is a measurement of accounts receivable divided by billings in the quarterly period  represented by the sum of revenues plus the change in the deferred revenues liability account balance 
this measurement was  and days at december   and  respectively  each within our publicly stated target range of to days 
our net cash used in investing activities of million in resulted primarily from our acquisition of cobion in january the license of development source code was approximately half of our capital purchases of million 
investing activities also included changes in our marketable securities that have quality characteristics similar to cash equivalents  except their maturities when we acquire them are longer than three months 
the cash flow statement included the purchase of million of intermediate term marketable securities  primarily interest bearing government obligations and commercial paper  offset by net proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of million 
our financing activities used million of cash in  principally due to the repurchase of million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million 
the original stock repurchase plan expired in july and a new repurchase program to repurchase up to million of our common stock through july was authorized by the board of directors in july since the inception of the stock repurchase programs  we have purchased approximately million shares of our common stock on the open market at an average cost of approximately per share for a total cash outlay of approximately million 
we can purchase up to an additional million under the current program 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  primarily money market accounts and investment grade debt securities 
an additional million of cash equivalents and marketable securities are pledged as collateral for stand by letters of credit related to the operating leases of our facilities and are shown on the balance sheet as restricted marketable securities 
we believe that such cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  we are not aware of any trends  events  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in any significant change to our liquidity 
from time to time  we evaluate possible acquisition and investment opportunities in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to ours 
in the event we determine to pursue such opportunities  we may use our available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities for this purpose 
off balance sheet arrangements payments for certain of our operating leases are secured by two collateralized stand by letters of credit totaling approximately million at december  the stand by letters of credit are annually renewable over the duration of the applicable leases 
these stand by letters of credit guarantee our payment obligations on the leases 
if we default on the lease payments  the landlords can claim against the letters of credit 
we  in turn  would be liable to the letter of credit issuers 
our stand by letters of credit are collateralized by securities worth million at december  other than these non cancelable 
table of contents operating leases  we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements  any relationships with structured finance or special purpose entities  or any contractual obligations with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to impact our liquidity 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations other total contractual cash obligations other obligations consist of payments due under an existing software licensing agreement 
the expected timing and payment of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
risk factors there are many factors that affect iss business and the results of its operations  some of which are beyond iss control 
the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause the actual results of iss operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 
we encourage you to read this section carefully 
we operate in a rapidly evolving market we operate in a rapidly evolving market and must  among other things respond to competitive developments  continue to upgrade and expand our product and services offerings  and continue to attract  retain and motivate our employees 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully address these issues 
as a result  we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to continue to operate profitably in the future 
we introduced our proventia appliance line in april that includes intrusion prevention and integrated security protection 
while initial market response to the introduction of these products has had a positive impact on our operating results  failure to continue to gain further market acceptance could result in revenues below our expectations and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our future operating results will likely fluctuate significantly we cannot predict our future revenues and operating results with certainty 
however  we do expect our future revenues and operating results to fluctuate due to a combination of factors  including the extent to which the public perceives that unauthorized access to and use of online information are threats to network security  customer budgets  
table of contents the mix of product sales among the various products offered by iss and whether revenue is recognized upon sale or deferred to subsequent periods  the volume and timing of orders  including seasonal trends in customer purchasing  our ability to develop new and enhanced product and managed service offerings  the introduction and acceptance rate of iss branded appliances  including increased cost of goods sold  our ability to accurately forecast and produce demanded quantities of our appliance products and models  availability of component parts of appliance products and reliance on contract manufacturers to produce such products  our ability to provide scalable managed services offerings in a cost effective manner  foreign currency exchange rates that affect our international operations  product and price competition in our markets  and general economic conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets 
we focus our efforts on sales of enterprise wide security solutions  which consist of our entire product suite and related professional services  and managed security services  rather than on the sale of component products 
as a result  each sale requires substantial time and effort from our sales and support staff 
in addition  the revenues associated with particular sales vary significantly depending on the number of products acquired by a customer  the number of devices used by the customer and the customer s relative need for our professional services 
large individual sales  or even small delays in customer orders  can cause significant variation in our license revenues and results of operations for a particular period 
the timing of large orders is usually difficult to predict and  like many software based technology companies  many of our customers typically complete transactions in the last month of a quarter 
we cannot predict our operating expenses based on our past results 
instead  we establish our spending levels based in large part on our expected future revenues 
as a result  if our actual revenues in any future period fall below our expectations  our operating results likely will be adversely affected because very few of our expenses vary with our revenues 
because of the factors listed above  we believe that our quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results likely will vary significantly in the future 
our ability to provide timely guidance and meet the expectations of investors with respect to our operating and financial results is affected by the tendency of a majority of our product and license sales to be completed in the last month of a quarter 
we may not be able to determine whether we will experience material deviations from guidance or expectations until the end of a quarter 
dependence on third party suppliers and manufacturers we carry little inventory of our appliance products and we rely on suppliers to deliver necessary components to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner based on the forecasts we provide 
we currently purchase some proventia appliance components and contract manufacturing services from single or limited sources 
if shortages occur  supplies are interrupted  or we underestimate demand for models  we may not be able to deliver products to our customers and our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected 
because our supply of hardware is based on short term forecasts and purchase orders  our contract manufacturers are not obligated to purchase components for greater quantities over longer periods 
we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers 
if we overestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory  which could increase our costs 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have an inadequate component inventory and  based on lead times  this could interrupt manufacturing and result in delays in shipments and revenues 

table of contents we face intense competition in our market the market for network security monitoring  detection  prevention and response solutions is intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
we cannot guarantee that we will compete successfully against our current or potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition 
our chief competitors generally fall within the following categories large companies  including symantec corp  cisco systems  inc  juniper networks  inc  and mcafee  inc  that sell competitive products and offerings  as well as other large software companies that have the technical capability and resources to develop competitive products  software or hardware network infrastructure companies like cisco systems  inc and juniper networks  inc 
that could integrate features that are similar to our products into their own products  smaller software companies offering relatively limited applications for network and internet security  and small and large companies with competitive offerings to components of our managed services offerings 
mergers or consolidations among these competitors  or acquisitions of small competitors by larger companies  represent risks 
for example  symantec corp  cisco systems  inc  mcafee  inc  and juniper networks  inc have acquired during the past several years smaller companies  which have intrusion detection or prevention technologies 
these acquisitions will make these entities potentially more formidable competitors to us if such products and offerings are effectively integrated 
large companies may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they can also devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  these companies have reduced and could continue to reduce  the price of their security monitoring  detection  prevention and response products and managed security services  which increases pricing pressures within our market 
several companies currently sell software products such as encryption  firewall  operating system security and virus detection software that our customers and potential customers have broadly adopted 
some of these companies sell products that perform the same functions as some of our products 
in addition  the vendors of operating system software or networking hardware may enhance their products to include the same kinds of functions that our products currently provide 
the widespread inclusion of comparable features to our software in operating system software or networking hardware could render our products less competitive or obsolete  particularly if such features are of a high quality 
even if security functions integrated into operating system software or networking hardware are more limited than those of our products  a significant number of customers may accept more limited functionality to avoid purchasing additional products 
in addition  with the introduction of our proventia integrated security appliance  we have offerings that compete with vendors of firewalls  vpns  anti virus systems  and content and spam filtering products 
these offerings are competitive with a broader spectrum of network security companies  as well as those that also offer integrated security appliances or broad product suites  like symantec corp 
for the above reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we face rapid technological change in our industry and frequent introductions of new products rapid changes in technology pose significant risks to us 
we do not control nor can we influence the forces behind these changes  which include the extent to which businesses and others seek to establish more secure networks  the extent to which hackers and others seek to compromise secure systems  
table of contents evolving computer hardware and software standards  changing customer requirements  and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
to remain successful  we must continue to change  adapt and improve our products in response to these and other changes in technology 
our future success hinges on our ability to both continue to enhance our current line of products and professional services and to introduce new products and services that address and respond to innovations in computer hacking  computer technology and customer requirements 
we cannot be sure that we will successfully develop and market new products that do this 
any failure by us to timely develop and introduce new products  to enhance our current products or to expand our professional services capabilities in response to these changes could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products involve very complex technology and  as a consequence  major new products and product enhancements require a long time to develop and test before going to market 
because this amount of time is difficult to estimate  we have had to delay the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products in the past and may have to delay the introduction of new and enhanced products in the future 
the techniques computer hackers use to gain unauthorized access to  or to sabotage  networks and intranets are constantly evolving and increasingly sophisticated 
furthermore  because new hacking techniques are usually not recognized until used against one or more targets  we are unable to anticipate most new hacking techniques 
to the extent that new hacking techniques harm our customers computer systems or businesses  affected or prospective customers may believe that our products are ineffective  which may cause them or prospective customers to reduce or avoid purchases of our products 
undetected product errors or defects could result in loss of revenues  delayed market acceptance and claims against us we offer warranties on our products  allowing the end customer to have any defective product repaired  or to receive a replacement product for it during the warranty period  or in certain circumstances return the product for a refund 
our products may contain undetected errors or defects 
if there is a broad product failure across our customer base  we may decide to replace all affected products or we may decide to refund the purchase price for defective units 
such defects and actions may adversely affect our ability to record revenue 
some errors are discovered only after a product has been installed and used by end customers 
any errors discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues and claims against us 
we offer warranties on our service levels for managed security services 
if we do not meet warranties  the customer generally may obtain credits for service 
if we are unable to fix errors or other product problems that later are identified after full deployment  or if we fail to meet our service levels for managed security services  in addition to the consequences described above  we could experience failure to achieve market acceptance  loss of customers  loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  and increased insurance costs 

table of contents our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures or bugs may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in our products 
we discover errors  failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays and could experience lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
despite testing  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
errors  failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in one of our end customer s security systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect results of operations 
we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services because our products and services provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information  we could face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate the confidential information or other property of end customers using our products  or interrupt their operations 
if that happens  affected end customers or others may sue us 
in addition  we may face liability for breaches caused by faulty installation of our products by our service and support organizations 
provisions in our contracts relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations may be unenforceable 
some courts  for example  have found contractual limitations of liability in standard computer and software contracts to be unenforceable in some circumstances 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  could be costly and could divert management attention 
our business liability insurance coverage may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all 
risks associated with our global operations the expansion of our international operations includes our presence in dispersed locations throughout the world  including throughout emea and the asia pacific and latin america regions 
our international presence and expansion exposes us to risks not present in our us operations  such as the difficulty in managing an organization spread over various countries located across the world  compliance with  and unexpected changes in  a wide range of complex regulatory requirements in countries where we do business  duties and tariffs imposed on importation of our products in other jurisdictions where other manufacturers may not bear those same costs  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens  potentially adverse tax consequences  
table of contents fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting in losses or gains from transactions and expenses denominated in foreign currencies  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  reduced protection for enforcement of creditor and contractual rights in some countries  and import and export license requirements and restrictions on the import and export of certain technology  especially encryption technology and trade restrictions 
despite these risks  we believe that we must continue to expand our operations in international markets to support our growth 
to this end  we intend to establish additional foreign sales operations  expand our existing offices  hire additional personnel  expand our international sales channels and customize our products for local markets 
if we fail to execute this strategy  our international sales growth will be limited 
our networks  products and services may be targeted by hackers like other companies  our websites  networks  information systems  products and services may be targets for sabotage  disruption or misappropriation by hackers 
as a leading network security solutions company  we are a high profile target 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation  and to respond to such situations  we expect these efforts by hackers to continue 
if these efforts are successful  our operations  reputation and sales could be adversely affected 
we must successfully integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we have and may continue to acquire or make investments in companies with products  technologies or professional services capabilities complementary to our solutions 
when engaging in acquisitions  we could encounter difficulties in assimilating or completing the development of the technologies  new personnel and operations into our company 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
these difficulties could also include accounting requirements  such as impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or expensing in process research and development costs 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully overcome these risks with respect to any future acquisitions or that we will not encounter other problems in connection with our recent or any future acquisitions 
in addition  any future acquisitions may require us to incur debt or issue equity securities 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute the investment of our existing stockholders 
our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce we rely primarily on copyright  trademark  patent and trade secrets laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have obtained one united states patent  one taiwanese patent  and have a number of patent applications pending  as well as numerous trademarks and trademark applications pending 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
there can be no assurance that any issued patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted under these patents will actually provide competitive advantages to us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
while we cannot determine the extent to which piracy of our software products occurs  we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as us government agencies and private parties 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features in our software and products including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights  we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense  time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

table of contents we may be found to infringe the proprietary rights of others third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to our business 
because of the large number of patents in the internet  networking  security and software fields  the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe or will infringe the patent rights of others 
third party asserted claims and or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers  suppliers  or customers  alleging infringement of proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products 
regardless of the merit of these claims  they can be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  or require us to develop a non infringing technology or enter into license agreements 
there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all  in these circumstances  or that any indemnification that might be available to us would be adequate to cover our costs of defense 
furthermore  because of the potential for large judgments  which are not necessarily predictable  it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant funds 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by a third party is successful  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  our business  operating results  financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
we must continue to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
to accomplish this  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options  restricted stock or similar incentive stock awards 
our current incentive stock plan expires in september and we believe that sufficient shares are available for issuance under that plan to meet our needs until it expires 
we expect to propose a new incentive stock plan to stockholders at our annual stockholders meeting in  but there is no assurance that shareholders will approve such plan  which would impair our ability to attract and retain necessary personnel 
some provisions in the iss certificate of incorporation and bylaws make a takeover of iss difficult our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of iss 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors  create preferred stock purchase rights that grant to holders of common stock the right to purchase shares of series a junior preferred stock in the event that a third party acquires or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock  prohibit the right of our stockholders to act by written consent  limit calling special meetings of stockholders  and impose a requirement that holders of of the outstanding shares of common stock are required to amend the provisions relating to the classification of our board of directors and action by written consent of stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest 
table of contents rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of high quality relatively short term investments  including governmental securities  commercial paper and overnight repurchase agreements  as well as longer term securities that have interest rates that are adjusted to market on a short term basis 
as of december   we had million of securities with fixed rates of interest that mature in more than three months and million of securities with fixed rates of interest that mature in more than six months but less than one year 
based on the average investments outstanding during and  increases or decreases of basis points would result in increases or decreases to interest income of approximately  and  in and  respectively  from the reported interest income 
risk associated with foreign exchange rates iss is subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates 
our foreign operations are  for the most part  naturally hedged against exchange rate fluctuations since both revenues and expenses of each foreign affiliate are denominated in the same currency 
therefore  we do not engage in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses remains minimal 
as a result  an unfavorable change in the exchange rate for any particular foreign subsidiary would result in lower revenues and expenses with regards to operating results  and lower assets and liabilities with regards to the balance sheet 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro and the japanese yen 
when the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies  the value of our non functional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our functional currency revenues increases 
since much of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  which is the foreign subsidiaries functional currency  the impact of exchange rates on net income or loss is relatively less than the impact on revenue 
although our operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  our results of operations may be affected significantly in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a fluctuation of in the average exchange rates of the euros and japanese yen relative to the us dollar during and would have resulted in increases or decreases in operating income of approximately million and million in and  respectively  from the reported operating income 
during  the company recorded a net foreign exchange gain of  the nature and extent of the foreign currency risk faced by the company depends on many factors that cannot be accurately predicted 
these factors include significant changes in foreign currency market conditions  the company s inability to match foreign currency denominated revenues with costs denominated in the same currency  and changes in the amount or mix of revenues denominated in various foreign currencies 
as a result of material unforeseen changes in these factors  the company s foreign currency risk could have a greater impact on the company s results of operations in the future
