however  subject to the company s commitment to certain funds with respect to fee waivers and expense limitations  the company may reduce the amount of fund expenses it is bearing 
mutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management  which include market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts  client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures  and the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed
