item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview synovis life technologies  inc synovis or the company is a diversified medical device company engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing products for the surgical and interventional treatment of disease 
our business is conducted in two reportable segments  the surgical business and interventional business  with segmentation based upon the similarities of the underlying business operations  products and markets of each 
our surgical business develops  manufactures and markets implantable biomaterial products  devices for microsurgery and surgical tools  all designed to reduce risk and or facilitate critical surgeries  leading to better patient outcomes and or lower costs 
our interventional business develops  engineers  prototypes and manufactures coils  helices  stylets  guidewires and other complex micro wire  polymer and micro machined metal components used in interventional devices for cardiac rhythm management  neurostimulation  vascular and other procedures 
after several years of significant business growth  both businesses confronted changes to their markets  which resulted in decreases in consolidated revenue and operating income in fiscal key drivers of our fiscal results are factors causing the gastric bypass market to be in a state of flux and a significant decline in demand from our crm customers as they adjusted their purchases 
the following highlight our fiscal results net revenue decreased to million 
surgical business revenue increased to million 
interventional business revenue decreased to million 
operating income decreased to million  operating margin of 
surgical business operating income decreased to million 
interventional business operating loss was million  a decrease of million from income of million in fiscal net income of million or cents per diluted share  down from cents and cents per diluted share in fiscal and  respectively

this line  which includes tissue guard and veritas r  accounted for of this segments growth 
veritas and tissue guard patches used in vascular procedures were responsible for most of this growth 
our devices for microsurgery and surgical tools product line increased or to  driven by a increase in sales of the coupler to  the coupler is a device used to connect extremely small arteries or veins  without sutures  quickly  easily and with consistently excellent results 
we consider our surgical tools product line to be mature 
peri strips r revenue increased or to  in fiscal peri strips are used to reduce risks and improve patient outcomes in surgical procedures  notably gastric bypass surgery and lung volume reduction surgery lvrs 
gastric bypass surgery is a treatment for morbid obesity which is believed to afflict between and million americans 
the slowdown in peri strips revenue growth during fiscal is attributable to several factors within the gastric bypass market which are in flux 
these factors include capacity constraints of many surgical practices that perform gastric bypass  the american society of bariatric surgeons driving the development of centers of excellence which specialize in gastric bypass surgery and have an expected lower rate of complications  insurance providers aggravating capacity constraints by encouraging patients towards such centers of excellence  certain hospitals electing not to support gastric bypass programs  concerns of some insurers that offer either health care or liability coverage  and competing products and technologies 
during the third quarter  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced that they now consider obesity to be an illness  meaning they will evaluate obesity treatments to reach conclusions about their effectiveness and potential coverage 
additionally  two studies published in fiscal in the journal obesity surgery cite the advantages of using peri strips in gastric bypass surgery 
first  a study at baylor university medical center  dallas  associated the use of peri strips with preventing leaks and decreasing bleeding at the gastric staple line  and furthermore  facilitating the transition of this operation to an outpatient procedure at baylor 
the second study  commissioned by synovis  was conducted in italy and demonstrated that using peri strips to reinforce the gastric staple line during laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery reduced both the number of titanium clips used to prevent bleeding and concurrently reduced operating time 
while the cms consideration and study results are positive  the multitude of factors affecting the gastric bypass market are still in flux  and need to stabilize before we can reasonably assess our potential growth opportunities 
peri strips revenue from lvrs has been slow to materialize in fiscal  following the decision by cms to cover the procedure 
going forward  the amount and timing of such revenue will be impacted by the frequency with which the procedure is performed and the extent to which peri strips are utilized in such procedures 
interventional business net revenue decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal our interventional business customers predominantly operate in the cardiac rhythm management crm market and we address three segments of this market pacing  implantable cardioverter defibrillation and congestive heart failure 
within the crm market  we produce conductor and shocking coils for pacing and defibrillator leads  helices for active fixation leads  and stylets used to implant all types of leads 
our interventional business has customarily experienced variations in revenue from period to period primarily due to inherent variability in the timing of customer demand 
such variations may continue in the future 
the following table summarizes our interventional business net revenue by market for the years ended october cardiac rhythm management   other   total   the following table summarizes our interventional business net revenue by product for the years ended october coils and helices   stylets and other wireforms   machining  molding and tool making   other   total   revenue from the three largest customers of the interventional business was a combined  in fiscal  a decrease of  or from  in fiscal our interventional business is affected by the general dynamics of the crm market  and we are most affected by the actions of our customers in response to this market 
we  like other companies serving the crm device industry  were severely impacted in fiscal as customers reduced purchases 
recently  the market opportunities in crm seem more promising due to expansion of indications for some of these devices  although there can be no assurance that this will positively impact future revenue 
our interventional business was issued two patents in fiscal from the us patent and trademark office one for a steerable stylet delivery system and another for an adjustable stiffness stylet delivery system 
we expect these technologies to have applications in site specific and minimally invasive therapies 
in march  our interventional business received clearance from the fda regarding k approval for its navi glide tm steerable stylet navi glide  a proprietary single use device intended to enable the physician to define and vary the curvature of the stylet during implantation of the cardiac lead  thereby avoiding the need to remove and recurve the stylet during introduction of the lead 
our interventional business is moving the navi glide and its patented steerable technology towards commercialization through our customers  with any related revenue dependant upon the time required to develop the technology to our customers specifications  acceptance by our customers of the developed technology and market acceptance of the products using this technology  as well as timing of customer orders 
our consolidated gross margin decreased three percentage points to in fiscal from during fiscal gross margins in our interventional business decreased eight percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of significantly higher overhead rates attributable to lower production volumes and reduced labor hours  directly related to lower than planned revenue 
in our surgical business  the gross margin for fiscal decreased two percentage points to  primarily due to lower utilization of manufacturing resources and higher fixed production costs  which thereby resulted in higher overhead rates associated with fiscal manufacturing activities 
factors which affect the consolidated gross margin include the relative revenue of each business segment  product mix within each business segment  volume and other production activities 
accordingly  our consolidated gross margins may fluctuate from period to period based on variations in these factors 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense during fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  sg a expense increased five percentage points  from in fiscal to in fiscal planned increases in regulatory and clinical expenses  facility expansion costs and marketing efforts  combined with lower revenue levels  are the primary reasons for this percentage increase 
research and development r d expense during fiscal was  an increase of  from  in as a percentage of net revenue  r d expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is partially due to the increased number  timing and nature of various surgical r d projects  as well as development expenses of various interventional projects including proprietary technology platforms which can be adapted for our customers 
in both business units  r d expense can fluctuate from year to year based on the timing and progress through external parties of the projects  and the timing of such expense will continue to be influenced primarily by the number of projects and the related r d personnel requirements  development and regulatory approval path  expected costs  timing and nature of those costs for each project 
during the second half of fiscal we incurred of other operating expenses  which were recorded within our surgical business 
we incurred of expenses related to our consideration of a significant acquisition  which was terminated for a variety of reasons 
the remaining was for legal fees incurred through october  pertaining to lawsuits filed against the company in fiscal which allege that the company and certain of its executive officers violated the securities exchange act of by issuing false or misleading statements about the company s business and prospects  which artificially inflated the price of the company s securities 
we believe that the lawsuits have no factual basis and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
however  we expect to incur additional legal expenses related to these suits in the future  potentially up to  in aggregate  the deductible under the insurance policy the company believes provides coverage for such lawsuits 
operating income for fiscal was  a decrease from  during fiscal surgical business operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal our interventional business recorded an operating loss of  in fiscal  compared with operating income of  in fiscal other income  primarily interest  increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal  as a result of increased cash  cash equivalents and short term investments due to  in net proceeds from our september private placement

our interventional business generated revenue growth in every product category over the same period of fiscal product line revenue from coil and helices increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal product line revenue from stylets and other wireforms was  in fiscal  an increase of  or from  in fiscal the revenue increases noted in each of these product groups was primarily due to the high demand for interventional customers end products during the year 
our interventional business manufactures products for customers providing medical devices in the large  high growth markets of cardiac rhythm management  neurostimulation and vascular intervention 
growth drivers in these markets during fiscal included new medical device features and applications  a growing senior population and new clinical studies which support the use of device technologies as an alternative to traditional drug therapies 
all of these factors contributed to increased demand for the devices our interventional customers provide to these markets  and accordingly increased demand for products manufactured by the interventional business 
our interventional business added machining  molding and tool making capabilities through an acquisition in march and subsequently added micro machining capabilities through continued investments made in fiscal these capabilities expanded the scope of offerings to interventional customers  resulting in net revenue of  in fiscal and  from march to october of fiscal  in all cases excluding product manufactured for internal use 
in march  operations commenced at synovis caribe  inc  a leased  square foot manufacturing facility in dorado  puerto rico 
the new facility is designed to increase the manufacturing capacity of our interventional business and strategically position us to capture new business

this revenue contributed two margin percentage points in fiscal there was no revenue from such contractual milestone payments in fiscal product mix and the costs of a growing workforce also contributed to the decrease in the interventional business gross margin in fiscal in our surgical business  the gross margin for fiscal increased two percentage points to  primarily due to sales mix  production volume and related manufacturing efficiencies 
sg a expense during fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  however  sg a expense decreased by five percentage points  from in fiscal to in fiscal the percentage decrease is the result of controlled sg a spending increases in a period of incrementally higher levels of revenue 
r d expense during fiscal was  an increase of  from  in as a percentage of net revenue  r d expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this planned increase was partially due to the development expenses of various interventional projects including proprietary devices for sale to interventional customers  along with the increased number  timing and nature of various surgical r d projects 
operating income for fiscal was  a increase  from  during fiscal surgical business operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in our surgical business was primarily due to relatively greater increases in volume of products sold  gross margin gains  and reduction in organizational operating expense as a percentage of revenue 
interventional business operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the provision for income taxes was  in fiscal  at an effective tax rate of  as compared to  at an effective tax rate of in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to higher r d credits reflecting greater levels of r d expenditures

for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our commitments under these obligations are as follows for the year ended october thereafter total capital leases operating leases     cash and cash equivalents were  at october  as compared to  at october   a decrease of  the decrease in cash is primarily related to our net purchases of  of short term investments during fiscal these investments represent highly liquid  low risk commercial paper with maturities greater than three months 
additional cash was used primarily for investments in capital equipment and facilities necessary to support our expected future growth 
operating activities provided cash of  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal cash was provided by operations during fiscal through the combination of net income of  and non cash expenses of  partially offset by a net increase in working capital 
working capital was used primarily for accounts receivable  and inventories  partially offset by cash provided by accounts payable 
depreciation increased in fiscal due mainly to the facility expansion at our st 
paul location 
inventory increased due primarily to increased production and overhead rates within our surgical business 
our consolidated days sales outstanding in accounts receivable at october  was at days  up from days the previous year  and is largely attributable to one customer within our interventional business  who subsequently brought their account current in the first quarter of fiscal investing activities used  of cash during fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  the increase is primarily due to the net purchases of  in short term investments 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal  an increase of  from fiscal  and largely reflect expenditures for building improvements and expansion  new enterprise resource planning software systems within certain businesses  as well as equipment acquisitions tied to expanding the capacity and capabilities of the interventional business
