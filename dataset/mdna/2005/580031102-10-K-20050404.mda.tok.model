item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section of the annual report on form k discusses the comparative year over year results of our operations  our liquidity and financial condition  our risk management practices and our critical accounting policies 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in sections f through f of this document 
overview change of fiscal year on january   we changed our fiscal year end to january  from december we believe that the twelve months ended december  provides a meaningful comparison to the twelve months ended january  and january  there are no factors  of which we are aware  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends  if results for the twelve months ended january  were presented in lieu of results for the twelve months ended december  references in this discussion to fiscal and fiscal represent the twelve months ended january  and january   respectively 
references to fiscal represents the twelve months ended december  revenue growth and competitive industry our revenue for the fiscal year ended january  represented a decrease over fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year this year over year revenue decline is the result of lower product revenue due primarily to lower average selling prices for directors and switches offsetting higher demand or port growth 
the decline in product revenue is partially offset by higher sales of software  service and warranty and escon products 
the decline in our product revenue has occurred while the market for our san products and solutions has grown more competitive with a the entrance of competitors into our market  b pricing pressures resulting from an increase in competitive products and solutions  c challenges to our direct assist sales model  and d anticipated competition from our own storage oem partners through their recent partnerships with competitors to jointly sell complementary products 
these market conditions present unique risks and uncertainties in a number of respects 
management believes the competitive market environment defines the overall performance of the company and provides a specific context to further analyze revenues  operating expenses and liquidity 
in particular  we anticipate continued elongated sales cycles and downward pricing pressures that could negatively impact our revenue growth rate 
moreover  revenue growth in fiscal is dependent on the introduction of our new products 
we are currently proceeding with the launch of the intrepid director and other new products including higher performance switches later in the year 
in addition  we are taking action to continue sales of products and technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of nishan 
as with any product introduction  we face risks in the design  testing  qualification and market acceptance of our new products 
some of the products we are developing may be more complex and feature rich than our current products  and some of the development on these products was undertaken prior to the nishan and sanera acquisitions 
if we fail to timely introduce new products  or if there is no demand for these or our current products  we may experience continued declines in revenue 
in addition to the recent increased competition in the industry  we have experienced a shift in the buying patterns of our customers from configured director products to non configured product sales including our switch products  directors port cards  and our flexport upgrades 
our oem and reseller partners may purchase certain of these component products ahead of end user demand  which could reduce subsequent purchases by those partners 
variations in the buying patterns of our customers would limit our ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter and could cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenue or earnings 
moreover  an unexpected decline in revenue without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses could intensify the impact of these factors on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
management believes the trend of revenue  controlling of operating expense and the related competitive environment define the overall performance of the company and provide a specific context to further analyze the financial results of the company 
merger and acquisitions on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with computer network technology corporation cnt  a provider of networking products  services and solutions 
upon completion of the merger  cnt shareholders will be entitled to receive shares of mcdata class a common stock for each share of cnt common stock then held by them  together with cash in lieu of fractional shares 
the boards of directors of mcdata and cnt believe that the proposed merger will create a combined company that will establish a leading position in enterprise storage networking  encompassing world class products  services and software 
the merger will combine the products  talent and expertise of two respected names in storage networking and is expected to accelerate mcdata s global enterprise data center initiative to deploy a broadened tiered network infrastructure 
the merger with cnt  which is anticipated to occur in mcdata s second quarter of fiscal  still requires the satisfaction of additional conditions including obtaining the approval of the shareholders of mcdata and cnt 
on september   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of nishan  a provider of multi protocol native ip storage switching solutions that builds open storage networking products based on ip and ethernet  both international networking standards 
on september   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of sanera  a developer of intelligent director class switching platform technologies 
the results of operations discussed below reflect the operating results of nishan and sanera from the dates of acquisition 
the purpose behind our acquisition of these two leading technology companies was to accelerate our time to market of leading edge technology products including ip storage networking 
beginning after the acquisitions  we integrated the operations of these entities into our existing engineering and sales divisions to take advantage of cost efficiencies  including consolidation of engineering facilities and support resources and elimination of redundancies 
although historically these two companies incurred significant operating expenses during their development phases  we don t believe the historical financial results of the two companies are indicative of future operating expenses for the company 
we believe that in the long term  these operating expenses will be offset by increased revenues as the technologies and products are integrated into our existing and next generation products 
restructuring activities in january  we announced that we were taking certain cost improvement actions  which included a workforce reduction and facility consolidation 
total restructuring costs of million consist of severance and benefit charges  facility closure expenses  and other charges 
severance and benefit charges of million include severance and related employee termination costs associated with the reduction of the company s workforce by employees  or approximately 
facility closure charges of million relate to losses for a leased engineering facility in toronto  canada 
in august  the company entered into agreements to sublease this facility to an unrelated third party through the company s remaining original lease term 
in connection with these agreements  the company made a one time payment of approximately million to satisfy all of its outstanding lease commitments for this facility 
these payments were applied against the restructuring reserve accrual and approximate the original estimates made by the company 
all planned activities under this plan had been completed and all remaining accrued liabilities were paid or settled 
revenue reclassification during fiscal  we began presenting a reformatted classification of revenue to provide further visibility into our product lines and to emphasize our software growth strategy 
all prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the new classification 
our revenue comprises the following product categories product revenue revenue from the sales of our director and switch products including eclipse san routers software and related maintenance revenue revenue from the sales of our software licenses and related maintenance agreements 
our software maintenance agreements consist of our standard post contract customer support pcs that are sold in conjunction with the initial sales of the software licenses 
these services include customer support that provides bug fixes  upgrades and telephone support 
software sales are incidental to our hardware sales 
other service revenue revenue from our professional service offerings as well as services provided under extended maintenance and upgraded warranty contracts for our hardware products 
escon revenue historical revenue earned from the escon service agreement and  beginning july   revenue from our escon product sales 
escon agreement amendment in  we entered into a services agreement with mcdata holdings corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of emc  to provide manufacturing and distribution management services for proprietary mainframe protocol  or escon  switching solutions manufactured for and sold to ibm 
under the terms of this agreement  we agreed to manage the escon product manufacture  design  order and product shipment in exchange for a service fee calculated as a fixed percentage of emc s escon revenues 
in the second quarter fiscal  we amended the service agreement to effectively assume the escon business operations 
this comprises the acceptance of the rights  risks and costs of inventory ownership and distribution  accounts receivable billing and collections  and sales and marketing activities 
we elected to amend the service agreement and effectively assume the escon business operations for two primary reasons 
first  we believe that the gross margin dollars that we will earn by managing the business in its entirety will exceed the service fees we would have earned under the prior arrangement 
second  as a result of our amendment of the service agreement  we obtained a retroactive increase in the prior service fee 
therefore  effective july   we began to fully consolidate the operations of the escon product line 
under this new arrangement  we have recorded million of escon product revenue related to sales made from july through january  in addition  we recorded the escon product inventory on our balance sheet and have included outstanding purchase commitments in our overall contract manufacturer commitments 
the escon technology is a mature technology 
ibm announced end of life on certain escon products as of december  the company believes that fourth quarter fiscal escon sales were driven higher than expected as enterprise customers  particularly in japan  waited until the final few months of product availability to place orders 
in fiscal  the company expects escon revenue to maintain a quarterly run rate below million 
in the results of operations discussion  we classify the escon revenue results as escon revenue in an effort to segregate this business from our current product sales 
qlogic joint development and marketing agreement on november   the company entered into a five year master joint development and marketing agreement with qlogic corporation  a delaware corporation qlogic 
pursuant to this agreement  the parties will jointly develop  market and distribute to select oems and other distribution channel partners certain joint embedded fabric switch and software offerings that consist of a qlogic embedded switch blade product for the server environment that is interoperable in mcdata fabrics and with mcdata s storage management and security software 
qlogic paid mcdata an initial fee of million has been deferred and will be recognized as revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
at the expiration of the agreement 
qlogic will also pay a unit royalty on sales of the joint product offering 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended january  year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets acquired in process research development and other acquisition related costs amortization of deferred compensation restructuring charges operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss before equity in net loss of affiliated company equity in net loss of affiliated company net loss revenues years ended january  year ended december  in millions product revenue software and related maintenance revenue other service revenue escon revenue total revenue our revenue for the year ended january  was million  which represented a decrease over fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year although we continue to see solid end user interest for our products and solutions  the on going competitive marketplace is expected to create a challenging sales environment for the foreseeable future 
given the entrance of competitors and products in our industry  we anticipate longer sales cycles and price declines that could negatively impact our revenue growth rate 
product revenue of million for fiscal year was a decrease over fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year this year over year revenue decline in product revenue reflects a increase in estimated director and switch ports sold offset by a decrease in estimated average sales prices 
the increase in sales of hardware ports reflects the market strength of our flex ports as well as our mid range switch products despite the economic and competitive environment 
we expect the number of ports shipped to fluctuate depending on the demand for our existing and newly introduced products including the timing of product introductions by our oem customers 
average sales price declines during fiscal were greater than the historical pricing declines typical with our technology products 
in fiscal  we lowered pricing on director chassis and switches to take advantage of the ongoing competitive environment 
these price declines were enabled by the lowered costs of our product components 
however  as discussed above  competition or unforeseen changes in technology could negatively impact our revenue growth rate 
our fiscal year revenue was negatively impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions and suppressed it storage and infrastructure spending  in particular in the high end director market and our transition from gb to gb speed products in the first half of this environment had a particularly negative effect on our product revenue  which declined  from fiscal year levels 
our new product introductions in the last half of  however  were widely received with higher than expected demand and revenue 
software and related maintenance revenue of million for fiscal year increased over fiscal year and increased from fiscal year this revenue growth is due to higher sales of our embedded software products including our santegrity security solution and higher sales of eclipse software 
a significant portion of our software revenue is generated from sales of our enterprise fabric connectivity manager  or efcm  software product 
other service revenue includes professional service revenue and revenue earned from our upgraded warranty and extended maintenance contracts on our hardware products 
other service revenue for the fiscal year was million 
this represents a increase from fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year these increases are due primarily to the activation of extended maintenance and upgraded warranty contracts sold in conjunction with our hardware products 
in prior periods  we experienced a significant growth in deferred revenue as the attach rates for extended maintenance contracts increased significantly primarily through ibm sales 
as the standard product warranties on these products expire  we believe we will continue to see a slight increase in maintenance revenue as the extended contracts are activated and deferred revenue is recognized 
as part of our recently announced oem agreement with ibm  we will no longer provide the end user support services through these extended maintenance contracts 
therefore  deferred revenue will decreases as the number of extended maintenance contracts is expected to decline in fiscal escon revenues of million for fiscal increased million from the million for fiscal  and million from the million for fiscal the increase reflects mcdata s assumption of the escon business operations from emc during the second quarter of fiscal as of july   escon revenue included product revenue from sales of these products 
in addition  escon revenue for fiscal includes million of previously deferred service fees 
these fees were deferred in prior periods in accordance with revenue recognition policies and the contract negotiations at that time 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with the largest storage oems 
for the year ended january   approximately of our total revenue came from emc  compared to and for fiscal years and respectively 
ibm  excluding the million of escon product revenue related to sales as discussed above  contributed approximately of our revenue for fiscal year compared to and for fiscal years and  respectively 
in addition  our third largest oem customer  hds  contributed approximately of our revenue for fiscal compared to and for fiscal years and  respectively 
other major storage and system vendors  including dell  hp  stk and sun  offer mcdata products and solutions 
in addition to our storage and system vendors  we have relationships with many resellers  distributors and systems integrators 
sales to these other channels represented  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decline in the revenue from emc as a percentage of our sales is the result of the entrance of new competitors into the storage market and the lengthened sales cycle in the high end director market  as well as the overall growth in revenue dollars from our other oems and non oem channels  particularly ibm with whom we have a strengthened relationship 
expanding our reseller  distributor and system integrator channels into small medium enterprise sme and vertical markets will be a strategic focus for us as we continue to grow our business 
however  the level of sales to any single customer may vary and the loss of any one significant customer  or a decrease in the level of sales to any significant or group of significant customers  could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
given the dependencies on our limited number of oem resellers combined with an increasingly competitive environment  we may experience continued adverse price pressures at critical times near the end of the fiscal quarters 
in addition  the fiscal quarters for many of our largest oem and reseller partners begin during the last month of our fiscal quarter 
while we do not have complete insight into the purchasing processes of our oem and reseller partners  we believe that such partners have and may purchase some amount of our non configured product in anticipation of end user customer demand that will be realized in the later portion of their fiscal quarter 
large end of quarter purchases by our partners could result in lower future revenues or earnings in our following fiscal quarter if market demand as forecasted by our partners does not materialize 
domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively  for the fiscal year ended january  for the year ended january   domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customers to which our products are shipped 
international revenues primarily consist of sales to customers in western europe and the greater asia pacific region 
included in domestic revenues are sales to certain oem customers who take possession of our products domestically and then distribute these products to their international customers 
in addition  included in revenues from western europe are sales to certain oem customers who take possession of our products in distribution centers designated for international bound product and then distribute these products among various international regions 
our mix of international and domestic revenue can  therefore  vary depending on the relative mix of sales to certain oem customers 
total deferred revenue balance of million at january   includes approximately million of long term deferred revenue which primarily represents unearned revenue from our customer support or maintenance contracts on our software and hardware products 
these contracts are billed and collected either upfront or annually at the beginning of each service period 
we recognize revenue from these contracts ratably over the contractual period  generally one to three years 
long term deferred revenue also includes the million fee associated with the joint development and marketing agreement with qlogic as discussed above 
the remaining portion of the deferred revenue balance at january   represents deferred revenue related to billings and collections for which one or more of the four criteria evidence of an arrangement  delivery  fixed price  and collectibility under sab no 
and the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 as amended  have not been met 
these balances are all classified as short term on the balance sheet at january  as all four criteria have historically been met in less than twelve months 
the timing over which we expect to recognize this revenue is as follows in thousands for fiscal years amount and thereafter includes the million joint development and marketing fee paid by qlogic 
gross profit for the fiscal years ended january  and  gross profit margin was and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of approximately basis points 
costs of goods sold consists of product costs  which are generally variable  and manufacturing operating cost  which include both variable and fixed expenses 
product costs as a percentage of revenue increased due to lower product revenues and growth in lower margin service products  which were partially offset by increases in higher margin software sales  lower component costs and the one time increase in revenue due to retroactive escon service fees 
manufacturing operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased due primarily to the release of inventory related reserves and obligations of approximately million or of the fiscal gross margins reported above 
for the fiscal years ended january  and december   gross profit margin was and  respectively 
during fiscal year  we incurred significant inventory related charges of million 
these charges were generated primarily from our transition to multiple product lines and quality problems on component parts 
we significantly reduced inventory costs during fiscal year with the implementation of our outsource focused manufacturing model  which was completed during fiscal year in anticipation of the competitive driven and natural decline in selling prices  we continue to drive cost advantages through our engineering and manufacturing processes 
in fiscal  we began selling lower cost versions of our second generation switch technology and began shipping the lower cost versions of our director components 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in engineering and r d activities  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  nonrecurring engineering charges  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  depreciation related to engineering and other test equipment  and it and facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal year  compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the million increase over fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses attributable to fiscal acquisitions and a million increase in spending related to new product development and testing 
this increased spending was partially offset by a million increase in the capitalization of software development costs during fiscal research and development expenses reflect the net impact of capitalized software development costs which reduce research and development expenses when recorded on the balance sheet and amortized against cost of goods sold upon introduction of the software product 
capitalized software costs were approximately million  million and million for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
these costs vary in conjunction with stages of development of our new products 
the approximate million  or  increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to incremental spending associated with our acquisitions  which included research and development costs and depreciation expense  and to a lesser extent  retention bonuses 
we anticipate the level of spending for the design  testing and qualification of our products to increase over prior years levels as we continue to broaden our product offerings 
selling and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales  costs associated with promotional and travel expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared with million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
increases in personnel  travel and equipment costs of approximately million for fiscal were partially offset by a million decrease in customer acquisition costs attributable to two new oem contracts signed during fiscal the million increase in sales and marketing expenses from fiscal to fiscal were primarily due to increased salaries  commissions and travel costs associated with increased revenues 
we believe that selling and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat in fiscal due to our efforts to contain expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for corporate executives  finance  human resources and investor relations  as well as accounting and professional fees  corporate legal expenses  other corporate expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal year  compared to million and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
the decrease of million from fiscal is primarily due to decreased litigation  personnel  consulting and equipment costs 
expenses for fiscal year included significant legal expenses related to the costs of litigating the brocade patent infringement lawsuit that was settled and million in charges related to the termination of a collateralized lease and the disposal of fixed assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets increased to million for the fiscal year compared with million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increases were the result of our fiscal acquisitions of nishan and sanera through which we recorded approximately million of amortizable intangible assets 
these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of one to six years 
acquired in process research and development ipr d and other acquisition related costs 
in connection with our equity investment in aarohi and our acquisition of nishan in september  a portion of the respective purchase prices was allocated to ipr d 
this ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
the ipr d charge for fiscal year totaled million 
amortization of deferred compensation 
we have recorded deferred compensation in connection with class b stock options granted prior to our august  initial public offering and restricted class b stock grants granted through our equity incentive plans 
in connection with our acquisitions during fiscal  we issued approximately million shares of class b restricted common stock with vesting periods ranging from to months 
in addition   shares vested immediately upon the retention of employees at nishan and sanera and were fully expensed 
we are amortizing all deferred compensation on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the applicable options and stock awards  resulting in amortization expense of million for fiscal  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year of which approximately   and  was included in cost of revenue  respectively 
deferred compensation expense related to these awards will decrease as the awards become fully vested over the following two to five years 
restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we were taking certain cost improvement actions  which included a workforce reduction and facility consolidation 
during fiscal  we completed our planned closure of our toronto engineering facility and recorded an approximate million restructuring charge related to this closure 
in addition  we incurred an additional  restructuring charge in fiscal for additional severance related and other costs as we finalized the reduction in workforce that was initiated in the fourth quarter of all planned activities under this plan had been completed and all remaining accrued liabilities were paid or settled 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consisted primarily of interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and various investment holdings 
interest income was million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in income from levels reflects the effects of lower cash and investment balances which is partially offset by the increase in interest rates during fiscal fiscal interest and other income decreased from levels due primarily to the decline in interest rates during fiscal partially offset by the effects of higher cash and investment balances resulting from cash generated from operations and the net proceeds from convertible subordinated notes that were issued in february see note convertible subordinated debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the average rate of return on investments for the year ended january  was compared to for fiscal year  and for fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense consists primarily of the amortization of issuance costs related to the convertible subordinated debt  the convertible debt interest expense not offset by the interest rate swap interest income discussed below and interest expense related to capital leases and notes payable 
interest expense was million for the year ended january  compared with million and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
fiscal interest expense consisted of approximately  of amortized debt issuance costs  approximately  of convertible debt interest expense offset by the interest rate swap interest income  and approximately  of interest expense related to capital leases and notes payable 
for fiscal  interest expense consisted of approximately million of net convertible interest expense  approximately  of amortized debt issuance costs and approximately  of interest expense related to capital leases and notes payable 
the million decrease in the net convertible interest expense from fiscal is attributable to an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in july the interest rate swap has the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our convertible subordinated notes the notes so that the interest payable on the majority of the notes effectively becomes variable based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor minus basis points 
the reset dates of the swap are february and august of each year until maturity on february  the initial six month libor setting for the swap was during the fiscal year  creating a rate of approximately minus  which was effective until february  during fiscal the six month libor rate was reset on february  to creating a rate of approximately minus  and on august   the six month libor setting was reset to  resulting in a rate of approximately 
on february   the six month libor setting was reset to  resulting in a rate of approximately  which is effective until august  significant increases in interest rates in future periods could significantly increase interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
the company has recorded tax expense for fiscal even though the pre tax result on the books is a loss 
this is due primarily to taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions where the net taxable income will be positive 
no tax benefit is realized currently for the book loss or available tax credits as the company has established a valuation allowance against its entire domestic net deferred tax assets 
during the fiscal year we recorded a non cash charge of million to create a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
a full valuation allowance was also created in fiscal against acquired deferred tax assets for million and against deferred tax assets relating to tax benefits recorded directly to shareholders equity for million 
neither of these items resulted in a current charge to income tax expense 
the valuation allowance related to acquired deferred tax assets resulted in an increase in goodwill 
if this portion of the valuation allowance is released in subsequent periods  goodwill will decrease by a like amount and we will record a charge to tax expense when the related deferred tax asset is realized 
if the valuation allowance charged to shareholders equity is released in subsequent periods  shareholders equity will increase by a like amount and we will record a charge to tax expense when the related deferred tax asset is realized 
we re evaluated the need for the valuation allowance during fiscal and concluded that a valuation allowance is still required with respect to our entire net deferred tax assets 
generally  the effective tax rate is determined by the relationship between pre tax book income or loss and certain amounts  which are reported differently between the financial statements and the tax return 
for fiscal  the tax rate is favorably impacted primarily by the deductibility of costs associated with our convertible subordinated debt  the extraterritorial income exclusion on qualifying exports and the research tax credit 
the tax rate is unfavorably impacted primarily by the permanent loss in value of amortized deferred compensation  the write off of the ipr d related to aarohi  and the net increase in our valuation allowance 
for fiscal  the tax rate is favorably impacted primarily by the settlement of tax items related to previous years  the deductibility of costs associated with our convertible subordinated debt  and the research tax credit 
the tax rate is unfavorably impacted by deferred compensation and the write off of the ipr d related to aarohi  as well as by the non cash charge for the valuation allowance 
for  the tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by tax exempt interest and the research tax credit 
the tax rate was unfavorably impacted by deferred compensation 
we are subject to audit by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
these audits may result in additional tax liabilities 
we account for such contingent liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
 and believe that we have appropriately provided for taxes for all years 
several factors drive the calculation of our tax reserves including i the expiration of statutes of limitations  ii changes in tax law and regulations  and iii settlements with tax authorities 
the occurrence of any of these events may result in adjustments to our reserves that could impact our reported financial results 
the internal revenue service recently completed an audit of the company s us income tax returns for  and an audit of these years was mandated by the procedures for joint committee cases due to the carry back of tax losses from the and tax years to the result of the audit was a nominal net benefit to the company  increasing the amount of net operating loss carry forwards 
in addition  the state of colorado has completed a review of income tax returns filed by the company with the state for and we received notification from the state auditor on november  that no changes would be proposed with respect to those returns 
liquidity and capital resources in summary  our cash flows were in thousands years ended january  year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities  net cash provided by used in financing activities   we invest excess cash predominantly in debt instruments that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and predominantly have maturities of less than three years with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes  including expansion of operations and potential acquisitions or other transactions 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments  including restricted cash  of million compared to approximately million as of january  cash provided by operating activities of million for primarily consists of our net loss adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  deferred compensation and inventory related charges offset by approximately million of changes in working capital and other activities 
working capital changes included an increase in other assets  balances of approximately million  reflecting increased capitalized software costs as well as an increase in inventories 
our cash flows from operations were also impacted by growth in deferred revenue of approximately million  which is due primarily to increased sales of extended maintenance contracts attached to sales of our hardware and software products 
cash provided by operating activities of million for primarily consists of our net loss adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  in process r d charges related to our acquisitions  deferred compensation  deferred taxes and inventory related charges offset by approximately million of changes in working capital and other activities 
from fiscal year to  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher revenues and a lower net loss before income taxes 
cash provided by operating activities in of million consisted primarily of the net loss adjusted for non cash charges of approximately million offset by approximately million used by working capital and other activities 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal of approximately  was primarily due to approximately million of cash provided by investment sales and maturities net of purchases offset by approximately million of capital expenditures 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal of approximately million was primarily attributable to cash used in acquisitions and purchases of equity investments of million  cash used to purchase net of sales and maturities investments in marketable securities during the year  and capital expenditures totaling approximately million 
cash used in investing activities increased from to primarily as a result of the acquisitions of sanera and nishan  as well as increased net purchases of marketable securities related to higher cash balances available for investing from our issuance of convertible subordinated notes in february reduced spending for capital expenditures in from offset these increases 
cash used in investing activities in of approximately million was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million associated with our completion and occupation of our office and engineering building 
the cash purchases were offset by proceeds from sales and maturities net of purchases of marketable securities for approximately million 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to cash used to repurchase common stock under our stock buy back program and payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the company s repurchase of common stock 
cash provided by financings in of million was primarily due to proceeds from issuance of convertible subordinated notes of million in principal amount  with proceeds of million and proceeds from the issuance of stock related to our stock option and employee purchase plans of million 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal of approximately  was primarily due to principal payments on capital leases of million offset by proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of common stock 
future sources and uses of cash we expect that cash flows from operations will continue to serve as our principal source of liquidity  and we believe that we have adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet our anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
however  cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and services as a result of rapid technological changes  integration costs associated with the pending merger with cnt  and other risks described under risk factors 
over the longer term  we may choose to fund our operations through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot provide any assurance that such additional long term financing  if required  could be completed on favorable terms 
our stock repurchase program allows us to acquire up to million of our common stock 
as of january   we had million available to repurchase shares under the program 
we intend to fund future purchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program through cash on hand and cash flows from operations 
we continue to review and evaluate alternative uses for our cash  including additional stock repurchases  potential acquisitions  and investments in our business 
off balance sheet arrangements other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements  the company does not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
during the normal course of business  we may enter into agreements with  among others  customers  resellers  oems  systems integrators and distributors 
these agreements typically require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims or product infringements on patents or copyrights 
we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising for the use of our products 
we have also indemnified our former parent  emc  for any income taxes arising out of the distribution of our class a common stock in february in addition  the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we evaluate and estimate losses from such indemnification under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
to date  we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification and guarantees in our financial statements 
commitments the company has contracted with sanmina sci systems  inc ssci  solectron corporation solectron and others collectively  contract manufacturers for the manufacture of printed circuit boards and box build assembly and configuration for specific multi protocol directors and switches 
the agreements require the company to submit purchasing forecasts and place orders sixty calendar days in advance of delivery 
at january   the company s commitment with the contract manufacturers for purchases over the next sixty days totaled million 
the company may be liable for materials that the contract manufacturers purchase on mcdata s behalf if the company s actual requirements do not meet or exceed its forecasts and those materials cannot be redirected to other uses 
at january   the company had recorded obligations of approximately million see note primarily related to materials purchased by the contract manufacturers for certain end of life and obsolete material 
management does not expect the remaining commitments under these agreements to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company received formal notification from ssci of its intention to terminate and renegotiate its manufacturing and purchasing agreement with mcdata on march  subsequently and to further extend the negotiation period  ssci extended this manufacturing and purchasing agreement until april  the company and ssci are in discussions regarding a potential renewal of the contract and we believe a new agreement will be signed before this date 
although unlikely  should the contract with ssci not be renewed  the company would be required to shift the manufacturing of product to another contract manufacturer 
such a transition may adversely affect our ability to deliver products to our oem s  distributors and resellers 
in february  the company sold million of convertible subordinated notes due february  the notes 
the notes are convertible into our class a common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes aggregate of approximately million shares or per share  subject to certain conversion adjustments 
upon a conversion  the company may choose to deliver shares of our class a common stock  or  in lieu of shares of our class a common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of class a common stock 
we are required to pay interest on february and august of each year  beginning august  debt issuance costs of million are being amortized over the term of the notes 
the amortization of debt issuance costs will accelerate upon early redemption or conversion of the notes 
the net proceeds remain available for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  the company entered into share option transactions using approximately million of proceeds 
as part of these share option transactions  the company purchased options that cover approximately million shares of class a common stock  at a strike price of 
the company also sold options that cover approximately million shares of class a common stock  at a strike price of 
the net cost of the share option transactions was recorded against additional paid in capital 
these share option transactions are intended to give the company the option to mitigate dilution as a result of the notes being converted to common shares up to the price per common share and mitigate dilution if the share price exceeds at that time 
should there be an early unwind of either of the share option transactions  the amount of cash or net shares potentially received or paid by the company will be dependent on then existing overall market conditions  the stock price  the volatility of the stock  and the amount of time remaining until expiration of the options 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that has the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the notes so that the interest payable on the majority of the notes effectively becomes variable based on the six month libor minus basis points 
the reset dates of the swap are february and august of each year until maturity on february  on february   the six month libor setting was reset to  resulting in a rate of approximately minus  which was effective until august  on august   the six month libor setting was reset to  resulting in a rate of approximately  which was effective until february  on february   the six month libor setting was reset to  resulting in a rate of approximately  which is effective until august  increases in interest rates could significantly increase the interest expense we are obligated to pay under the interest rate swap agreement in future periods 
the swap was designated as a fair value hedge and  as such  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument  as well as the fully offsetting gain or loss on the notes attributable to the swap  were recognized in earnings 
we are also required to post collateral based on changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap 
this collateral  in the form of restricted cash  was million at january  on september   mcdata entered into a triple net office lease with ridge parkway associates  llc  a delaware limited liability company for the future lease of office space at ridge parkway  building  broomfield  colorado the new premises 
the company intends to begin moving its current world headquarters location at interlocken crescent  broomfield  colorado to the new premises early in with lease payments commencing in february of the company s current headquarter s office lease expires at the end of april the term of the new lease is for years with two year renewal options and is at market lease rates that are substantially lower than the current lease rate paid by the company 
the base annual lease rates per rentable square foot for the new premises range from in the first year to in the last year of the lease  plus normal operating expenses 
in addition  the company has an option to purchase the new premises at varying amounts until december  the lease and option to purchase have customary terms and conditions 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including interest expense and commitments as of january  in thousands total less than year years years more than years convertible subordinated debt   interest on convertible subordinated debt    non cancelable operating leases     non cancelable purchase agreements   capital leases  including interest  total contractual obligations     long term cash availability we believe our existing cash  short term and long term investment balances  and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements at least through the next twelve months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development of new products and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
inflation we believe that our revenue and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the last three fiscal years

this statement eliminates the provision of sfas no 
that allows issuing entities to overcome the presumption that certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares will be settled in shares 
lastly  this statement requires that shares to be issued upon conversion of a mandatorily convertible security be included in the computation of basic eps from the date that conversion becomes mandatory

a  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations 
the proposed fsp addresses accounting by commercial users and producers of electrical and electronic equipment  in connection with directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment issued by the european union on february  the directive 
this directive requires eu member countries to adopt legislation to regulate the collection  treatment  recovery  and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic waste equipment  and sets forth certain obligations relating to covering the cost of disposal of such equipment by commercial users 
producers will also be required to cover the cost of disposal of such equipment by private household users 
the proposed fsp sets forth accounting for such obligations by commercial users and producers  with respect to sfas no

critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of mcdata s board of directors 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  in accordance with sab no 
and sop no 
 as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  products are delivered or services rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is assured 
in instances when any one of these four criteria is not met  we will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria have been met 
with respect to revenue from our configured products  we request evidence of sell through from our oem and distributor partners prior to recognizing revenue 
in situations where our oem and distributor partners refuse to provide sell through information when requested  but all the criteria under sab no 
as discussed above have been met  we recognize revenue for such configured products 
these configured products represent high value  customized solutions of directors  cabinets and various combinations of port cards ordered by our oem and distributor partners as required by the end user 
non configured products and components  such as our switch products  additional port cards  and flexport upgrades  are recognized as revenue when the criteria for sab no 
as discussed above have been met  generally at time of shipment 
revenue for both configured and non configured products and components is reduced for estimated customer returns  price protection rebates  and other contract terms that are provided to the company s oems  distributors and resellers 
these estimates are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when rights of return exist sfas no 
and rely on historical experience 
we have not experienced credits in excess of of annual revenues 
if actual credit experience varies from our historical experience due to changes in product technology  the pricing environment or other unforeseen factors  our revenue could be adversely affected 
through the second quarter of fiscal mcdata had recognized revenue on distributor sales of non configured products when proof of sell through was obtained 
this was due to insufficient historical experience regarding returns or credits under price protection or inventory rotation rights 
mcdata has been monitoring and tracking distributor returns and purchasing patterns since we believe we have obtained sufficient historical experience as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal therefore  during the third quarter of fiscal we began recognizing distributor revenue at the time of shipment 
we estimate the potential for returns in accordance with sfas no 
and record revenues upon shipment if all sab no 
revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in the third quarter fiscal  in connection with this change in estimate  we recognized approximately million of distributor revenue which had previously been deferred 
if actual credits received by our partners for returns or price protection and inventory rotation actions were to deviate significantly from our estimates  which are based on historical experience  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable values 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about current and future demand for our products  the current market conditions  new product introductions  new technologies and the current life cycle of our products 
adverse changes in these factors and our assumptions could result in an increase in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand and increase our cost of revenue 
additionally  we have certain purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers that are non cancelable 
we may be liable for materials that our third party manufacturers purchase on our behalf if our actual requirements do not meet or exceed our forecasts and those materials cannot be redirected to other uses by the contract manufacturers 
we evaluate these open purchase orders in light of our current inventory on hand  expected demand  market conditions and new product introductions 
based on this information  we record purchase obligations for inventory we believe is excess or obsolete and cannot be redirected to other uses by our contract manufacturers 
at january   the company s commitment with our contract manufacturers for purchases over the next sixty days totaled million  of which we had recorded reserves of approximately see note million 
adverse changes in our and our contract manufacturers calculations and assumptions concerning these purchase commitments may result in an increase to our vendor obligations and increase our cost of revenue 
warranty provision we also provide for estimated expenses for warranty obligations as revenue is recognized 
these estimates are based primarily on our historical experience with product failures  cost to repair and known identified product quality issues 
our historical warranty claims has been immaterial with actual warranty claims representing less than of our annual cost of sales 
future material changes in our product and component quality or significant increases in our warranty repair and replacement cost could require revisions to the estimated warranty liability and could significantly increase our product costs  cause significant customer relations problems and reduce revenue 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction where we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from items that have different timing or treatment for income tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
at january   our net deferred tax assets equaled million before any valuation allowance 
this balance relates totemporary differences  such as the timing of revenue recognition and accrued expenses  depreciation methods  and reserve accounts  as well as tax net operating loss and research and development credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance has been established against the entire net deferred tax asset 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we assessed the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have considered past operating losses  cumulative losses for financial accounting in recent years  estimated future taxable income and our ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
after considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  management concluded  after applying the provisions of sfas no 
 that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
the portion of the valuation allowance relating to the acquisitions of nishan and sanera is applied as an increase to the basis of other assets from the acquired companies instead of a charge against net income 
we are subject to audit by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
these audits may result in additional tax liabilities 
we account for such contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and believe that we have appropriately provided for taxes for all years 
several factors drive the calculation of our tax reserves including i the expiration of statutes of limitations  ii changes in tax law and regulations  and iii settlements with tax authorities 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to our reserves which could impact our reported financial results 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets we have performed and will perform an annual impairment test for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this review is based on a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets including goodwill balances to the fair value of our net assets using the quoted market price of our common stock 
we performed the impairment test during our first fiscal quarter and determined that no impairment loss should be recognized 
in the event that business conditions change and our market value were to drop significantly below year end levels  future tests may result in a need to record a loss due to write down of the value of goodwill 
at january   goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
we currently operate our business as a single solutions business and do not maintain separate cash flows or operating margins on a segmented level 
future operating losses  deterioration of our business or segmentation of our operations in the future could also lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize certain software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas no 

under sfas no 
 costs incurred to develop a computer software product are charged to research and development expenses as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
we establish technological feasibility upon completion of a detailed program design or working model from which point all research and development costs for that project are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenues  estimated economic life of the products  or both 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates and credit risks 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents  our investment portfolio  and our interest rate swap 
our investment portfolio is primarily maintained in four major financial institutions in the united states and consists primarily of readily marketable investment grade debt securities of various issuers and maturities ranging from overnight to greater than thirty years 
all investments are denominated in us dollars and are classified as available for sale 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes 
as interest rates change  the amount of unrealized gain or loss on these securities will change 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of january   using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant 
the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at january  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  assuming that such investment holdings remained constant through the year and an increase of investment income of approximately  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  and a decrease in investment income of approximately  our convertible subordinated debt is subject to a fixed interest rate and the notes are based on a fixed conversion ratio into class a common stock 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that has the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the notes so that the interest payable on the majority of the notes effectively becomes variable based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor minus basis points 
if interest rates on this variable rate debt were to increase or decrease  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease accordingly 
this increased or decreased interest expense would be partially offset by the effects of these interest rate changes on our cash and investment portfolio 
the notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system  however  the notes are eligible for trading on the portalsm market 
on january   the approximate bid price per of our notes was and the approximate ask price of our notes was  resulting in an aggregate fair value of between million and million 
our class a common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market under the symbol  mcdta 
on march   the last reported sale price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq national market was per share 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate sales and support offices in several countries 
all of our sales contracts have been denominated in us dollars  therefore our transactions in foreign currencies are limited to operating expense transactions 
due to the limited nature and amount of these transactions  we do not believe we have had or will have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of temporary cash investments  investments and trade receivables 
we place our temporary cash investments and investment securities in primarily investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one financial institution 
we evaluate the credit risk associated with each of our customers  including our largest customers  emc and ibm  but generally do not require collateral 
we depend on these two customers for most of our total revenue 
they also comprise a significant portion of our trade receivables and  therefore  expose us to a concentration of credit risk 
in conjunction with the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes  we also entered into share option transactions on our class a common stock with bank of america  na and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our class a common stock price  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of these options in our favor 
based on our review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of bank of america  na and its affiliates  we have concluded that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of these share option transactions 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with jpmorgan chase bank jpmorgan 
subject to the movement in interest rates  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net interest payments due to us from jpmorgan 
based on our review of the possible movement in interest rates and the credit strength of jpmorgan  we have concluded that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of this interest rate swap
