sales growth in the safety  security and protection services segment was driven by continued demand for personal protection products along with strong demand for cleaning and protection products 
sales growth in the consumer and office segment was broad based  with the transportation segment led by both the automotive oem and repair markets 
the health care segment experienced tough year on year comparisons through the first three quarters of the year  with improvement in the fourth quarter of for the electro and communications segment  this was the first year of positive sales growth since refer to the performance by business segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective segments

refer to the performance by geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective areas 
operating income in increased by versus  as all seven business segments posted increases 
the combination of solid sales growth and positive benefits from m s corporate initiatives drove the operating income increase 
cost reduction projects related to these initiatives six sigma  global sourcing effectiveness  m acceleration and eproductivity contributed over million in aggregate operating income benefits in see note a at the end of this overview section 
currency impacts  related primarily to the weaker us dollar  boosted operating income by an estimated million  partially offset by increased pension expense of million 
operating income in was negatively impacted by a million pre tax charge related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against m in by lepage s inc m generated billion of operating cash flows in  a million increase over  and ended the year with billion of cash and cash equivalents 
cash flow in was primarily driven by higher net income 
in  the company utilized billion of cash to repurchase m common stock and pay dividends  and contributed million to its pension plans 
m s debt to total capital ratio total capital defined as debt plus equity as of december   was approximately 
m has an aa credit rating from standard poor s and an aa credit rating from moody s investors service 
in  m expects to continue its momentum to drive sales  operational efficiency and cash flow growth 
m is looking for continued broad based product sales to drive its growth  in addition to expected continued growth in optical film products  and will also continue to assess potential acquisitions 
continued core volume sales growth will require both faster growth of existing products services and successful introduction of new products 
while international sales now represent of worldwide sales  the company will also focus on execution of sales and growth opportunities in the united states 
in part to energize the m acceleration initiative  early in the company launched an extensive effort to reconnect and re engage with customers 
this will aid m in its continuing quest to provide additional customer value  with both the customer and m benefiting through value creation and also facilitating m s ability to achieve appropriate pricing 
the company also is focused on its corporate initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs 
cost reduction projects related to these initiatives are expected to contribute an additional million to operating income in the company has experienced both price increases and supply limitations affecting several oil derived raw materials  but to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results  although the company minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact 
m will also continue  as it has for many years  to incur expenses insured and uninsured in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected refer to the forward looking statements discussion later in item for discussion of these risks and uncertainties 
note a 
the company s five corporate initiatives six sigma  global sourcing effectiveness  m acceleration  eproductivity and global business processes are aimed at accelerating long term top line growth  improving cash flow and lowering its total cost structure 
indirect cost control  which focused on reducing costs not directly associated with products or services  is no longer a formal initiative and is now managed using a productivity metric 
six sigma focuses on higher growth  productivity and cash flow 
global sourcing effectiveness generates savings by leveraging purchasing economies of scale  encouraging competition among suppliers  geographic broadening and e applications 
through its m acceleration initiative  the company is driving toward more and better new product ideas and faster  more impactful new product introductions  along with reallocating research and development resources to larger  more global projects 
in eproductivity  m believes it has a significant opportunity to improve productivity for its customers  suppliers and for m itself 
m s global business processes initiative continues m s ongoing effort to standardize  simplify and strengthen its business processes in order to increase the speed  efficiency and quality of service functions vital to its business operations worldwide 
there can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
numerous factors may create offsets to these savings  such as the potential for weakness in sales volumes  normal increases in compensation and benefits  and other inflationary pressures 
the company estimates that cost reduction projects related to initiatives provided a combined incremental benefit to operating income of more than million in  after contributing a similar amount in these initiatives provided an incremental benefit to operating income of more than million in index to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference pages item

critical accounting estimates information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as stated in note  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings  the company s pension and postretirement obligations  and potential asset impairment issues 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of m s board of directors 
legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings contained in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this annual report on form k for a description of the process the company follows for the accrual and disclosure of loss contingencies  the categories of claims for which the company has been able to estimate its probable liability and for the estimate of its related insurance receivables  and factors affecting such estimates 
pension and postretirement obligations m has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense 
as previously disclosed in the company s june  and september  form qs  in  the company s us plan measurement date was changed from september to december the primary reasons for this change include consistency between the us and international dates  the increased clarity that results from having the same measurement and balance sheet dates  and administrative simplification 
this change did not have a material impact on the determination of periodic pension cost or pension obligations 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on projected results for similar allocations among asset classes 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and  under certain circumstances  amortized over future years of service 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
for the us pension plan  the company s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was for refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information on how this rate is determined 
the company is lowering the expected return on plan assets by percentage points to 
the discount rate used to measure pension plan liabilities reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled as of december  in estimating this rate  the company looks at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
by applying this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of to be appropriate as of december   which is a reduction of percentage points from the rate used as of september  for the year ended december   the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by billion after tax 
this increase was primarily the result of the assets being above the accumulated benefit obligation for the us qualified plan  which caused the minimum pension liability recorded for the years ended december  and to be reversed 
as a result  the company s us qualified plan recorded a prepaid pension asset of billion 
for the year ended december   the company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense after settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits of million  up from million in pension expense before settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately million in as previously mentioned  the company lowered the expected return on assets assumption from in to in for the us pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by percentage points would decrease increase us pension expense by approximately million in for the us pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would decrease increase us pension expense by approximately million in potential asset impairment issues m net property  plant and equipment totaled approximately billion at december  management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit 
in addition  m goodwill totaled approximately billion at december   which  based on impairment testing  is not impaired 
a portion of this goodwill approximately million is in m s telecommunications business  which competes in a very uncertain industry 
while the company believes this business will maintain its value  events such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  could create future impairment losses

r effective july  additional information regarding this and other accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition and liquidity the company generates significant ongoing cash flow as evidenced by the reduction in net debt during as follows at december millions total debt less cash cash equiv 
net debt m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures 
the company has an aa credit rating from standard poor s and an aa credit rating from moody s investors service 
the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs 
the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company s stock 
the company s financial condition and liquidity at december   remained strong 
various assets and liabilities  including cash and short term debt  can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs 
working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  this slight increase was primarily related to an increase in cash million offset by an increase in debt classified as short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt million 
the cash balance benefited from higher net income and working capital improvements in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities ie accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable 
these measures may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the accounts receivable turnover index defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four  divided by ending net accounts receivable totaled at december   an improvement from at december  receivables increased million compared with december   with currency translation of million due to the weaker us dollar driving this increase

many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts  in which m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers 
the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated 
the majority of m s products and services are purchased as needed  with no unconditional commitment 
for this reason  these numbers will not provide a reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in thus  company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in and future years 
contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table  but these commitments represent a small part of the company s expected capital spending in and beyond 
for  the company expects to spend approximately million on purchases of property  plant and equipment 
financial instruments the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure  interest rate risks and commodity price risks 
a financial risk management committee  composed of senior management  provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities 
this committee determines the company s financial risk policies and objectives  and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization 
this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation  risk analysis  counterparty credit approval  and ongoing monitoring and reporting 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts  options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions 
the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
to help manage borrowing costs  the company may enter into interest rate swaps 
under these arrangements  the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts  price protection swaps and forward physical contracts 
a variance co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the company s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments  derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december  the model third party bank dataset used a confidence level over a month time horizon 
based on this analysis of the company s interest rate risks  possible changes in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on after tax earnings million at december  and million at december  
based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks  possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by million million at december  
when including certain commodity risks  possible changes in commodity rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by an additional million an additional million at december  
the model used analyzed over different currencies and five commodities  but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company 
this model does not include certain hedge transactions  because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 
the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales  and because approximately of sales are outside the united states  this would increase production outside the united states 
this will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations 
in  the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings 
however  this hedging program will not make m immune to currency impacts 
the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year

forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may be identified by the use of words like plan  expect  aim  believe  project  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could and similar expressions in connection with any discussion  expectation or projection of future operating or financial performance  events or trends 
in particular  these include statements about the company s strategy for growth  product development  market position  future performance or results of current or anticipated products  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings 
factors that could affect future results forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the following results and trends are impacted by the effects of  and changes in  worldwide economic conditions 
the company operates in more than countries and derives approximately of its revenues from outside the united states 
the company s business may be affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control  such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region  social  political or labor conditions in a specific country or region  or potential adverse foreign tax consequences 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations 
because the company derives approximately of its revenues from outside the united states  its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
the company s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings  including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  gain market acceptance of new products  or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 
for example  new m pharmaceutical products  like any pharmaceutical under development  face substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review 
there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful 
the company s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components and materials  including oil derived compounds  due to market demand  currency exchange risks  material shortages and other factors 
the company depends on various components and materials supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products and it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted or terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand  currency risks or material shortages  or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
there is the possibility that acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet sales and or profit expectations 
as part of the company s strategy for growth  the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions and enter into strategic alliances 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to quickly integrate the acquired business and obtain the anticipated synergies or that acquisitions and strategic alliances will be beneficial to the company 
the company s future results may be affected if the company generates less operating income from its corporate initiatives than estimated 
m s corporate initiatives include six sigma  global sourcing effectiveness  m acceleration  eproductivity and global business processes 
cost reduction projects related to these initiatives are expected to contribute an additional million to operating income in there can be no assurance that all of the estimated operating income improvements from the initiatives will be realized 
the company s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings  including those involving product liability  antitrust  environmental or other matters 
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company s expectations because the outcomes of litigation  including regulatory matters  are often difficult to reliably predict 
various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable  or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates  such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment  significant settlement or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse ruling  settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period 
a specific factor that may influence the company s estimate of its future asbestos related liabilities is the pending congressional consideration of legislation to reform asbestos related litigation and pertinent information derived from that process
