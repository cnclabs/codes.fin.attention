item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview revenues for the year ended december  were billion compared to billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income was million for compared to million for and million for diluted earnings per share on net income were per share for compared to per share for and per share for positively impacting net income and diluted earnings per share were increased operating income from the united kingdom construction and facilities segment which reported breakeven results for compared to an operating loss of million for  increased gross profits from transportation infrastructure  financial services  healthcare and hospitality work for the united states electrical construction and facilities services segment and a reduction in the provision for income taxes of approximately million in and this was offset by decreased gross profits due to a poor contract performance on certain work in the united states mechanical and the canada construction and facilities services segments  b continued decreased availability of higher margin discretionary small project spending and repair and maintenance work in certain geographical markets in the united states  c continued heightened price competition for commercial  industrial and public sector work in the united states  and d increased prices for certain fixed price construction project materials  particularly in canada 
the results were also positively affected by the implementation of significant strategic decisions and management changes initiated by emcor group  inc senior management in late and during these actions included a curtailment in bidding for public sector work  replacement of senior management at certain business units and reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses in all segments 
related to these actions were million of restructuring expenses in  principally employee severance obligations 
emcor will continue to focus during on controlling selling  general and administrative expenses  increasing revenues from multi year facilities services contracts and selective estimating and bidding of work 
at the same time  a continued gradual improvement in commercial construction is anticipated 
management believes it has positioned emcor to benefit from the strategic decisions and management changes initiated in late and during  however  there is no assurance that there will be significantly improved future results if economic conditions  with respect to the availability of more profitable private sector work affecting emcor and the construction industry generally  do not continue to improve and competitive pressures do not ease 
results of operations for compared to were positively impacted by the acquisition of the capital stock of consolidated engineering services  inc ces in december and an increase in revenues and income generated by united states facilities services operations and united states transportation infrastructure work 
however  the results compared to were negatively impacted by a poor performance in the united kingdom construction operations  b increased competition for  and a related decrease in gross profit margin on  commercial and industrial work in the united states due to a continuing decline in commercial and industrial work in the united states resulting from the economic recession  c reduced private sector spending on small and discretionary projects and repairs and maintenance work resulting from the economic recession  d an increase in the percentage of work relating to public sector construction that typically has lower gross profit margins than private sector work  e lower than historical gross profit margins on several united states projects as a result of poor contract performance  and f reduced labor productivity due to the uncertain job market 
the foregoing factors affecting the united states subsidiaries are hereafter referred to collectively as the unfavorable united states market conditions 
the consolidated results of operations for emcor for the year ended december  include the results of operations of a a group of companies the acquired comfort companies acquired from comfort systems usa  inc and b ces from their respective dates of acquisition in emcor acquired one additional company during each of and  and their results of operations are also included from their respective dates of acquisition 
see note c acquisitions of businesses and disposition of assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions 
operating segments emcor has the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design  integration  installation  startup  operation and maintenance of various systems a united states electrical construction and facilities services involving systems for generation and distribution of electrical power  lighting systems  low voltage systems such as fire alarm  security  communications and process control systems and voice and data systems  b united states mechanical construction and facilities services involving systems for heating  ventilation  air conditioning  refrigeration  and clean room ventilation systems  and plumbing  process and high purity piping systems  c united states facilities services  d canada construction and facilities services  e united kingdom construction and facilities services  and f other international construction and facilities services 
the segment united states facilities services principally consists of those operations which provide a portfolio of services needed to support the operation and maintenance of customers facilities mobile operation and maintenance services  site based operation and maintenance services  facility planning and consulting services  energy management programs and the design and construction of energy related projects which services are not related to customers construction programs 
the canada  united kingdom and other international segments perform electrical construction  mechanical construction and facilities services 
the other international construction and facilities services segment represents emcor s operations outside of the united states  canada and the united kingdom primarily in south africa and the middle east during the periods presented 
emcor s interest in its south african joint venture was sold in july application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
emcor s significant accounting policies are described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
there was no initial adoption of any accounting policies during emcor believes that some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that affect the financial condition and results of operations are the impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to a revenue recognition from i long term construction contracts for which the percentage of completion method of accounting is used and ii services contracts  b collectibility or valuation of accounts receivable  c insurance liabilities  d income taxes  and e intangible assets 
revenue recognition from long term construction contracts and services contracts emcor believes its most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition from long term construction contracts for which emcor uses the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion accounting is the prescribed method of accounting for long term contracts in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and accordingly  the method used for revenue recognition within emcor s industry 
percentage of completion for each contract is measured principally by the ratio of costs incurred to date to perform each contract to the estimated total costs to perform such contract at completion 
certain of emcor s electrical contracting business units measure percentage of completion by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date to perform each contract to the estimated total labor costs to perform such contract at completion 
provisions for the entirety of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
application of percentage of completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in emcor s consolidated balance sheets 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers based upon various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of a contract 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include amounts emcor seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs unapproved change orders and claims 
such amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value and take into account factors that may affect the ability to bill unbilled revenues and collect amounts after billing 
no profit is recognized on the construction costs incurred in connection with claim amounts 
as of december  and  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included unbilled revenues for unapproved change orders of approximately million and million  respectively  and claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  accounts receivable as of december  and include claims of approximately million and million  respectively  and contractually billed amounts related to such contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
generally  contractually billed amounts will not be paid by the customer to emcor until final resolution of related claims 
due to uncertainties inherent in estimates employed in applying percentage of completion accounting  estimates may be revised as project work progresses 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of revised estimates be reported prospectively in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to revenue recognition for long term construction contracts  emcor recognizes revenues from services contracts as such contracts are performed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revised and updated sab 
there are two basic types of services contracts a fixed price services contracts which are signed in advance for maintenance  repair and retrofit work over periods typically ranging from one to three years pursuant to which there may be emcor employees on a customer s site full time and b services contracts which may or may not be signed in advance for similar maintenance  repair and retrofit work on an as needed basis frequently referred to as time and material work 
fixed price services contracts are generally performed over the contract period  and accordingly  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract 
revenues derived from other services contracts are recognized when the services are performed in accordance with sab expenses related to all services contracts are recognized as incurred 
accounts receivable emcor is required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables 
relevant assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer  emcor s prior collection history with the customer and related aging of past due balances 
the provisions for bad debts during   and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in this provision for compared to primarily related to the potential non payment of an account receivable of approximately million due to the publicly reported financial difficulties of the customer which owed that amount 
this receivable was written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in at december  and  accounts receivable of  million and  million  respectively  included allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
specific accounts receivable are evaluated when emcor believes a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition or its credit ratings 
the allowance requirements are based on the best facts available and are re evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis and as additional information is received 
insurance liabilities emcor has deductibles for certain workers compensation  auto liability  general liability and property claims  has self insured retentions for certain other casualty claims and is self insured for employee related health care claims 
losses are recorded based upon estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the liabilities are derived from known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of these obligations 
emcor believes its liabilities for these obligations are adequate 
however  such obligations are difficult to assess and estimate due to numerous factors  including severity of injury  determination of liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences and effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
income taxes emcor had net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from deductible temporary differences of million and million at december  and  respectively  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  and  the total valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in the valuation allowance was recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences of the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment inasmuch as there is uncertainty of sufficient future income to realize the benefit of such deferred tax assets 
intangible assets as of december   emcor had goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets primarily the market value of its backlog  customer relationships and trademarks and tradenames of million and million  respectively  arising out of the acquisition of companies 
the determination of related estimated useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and whether those assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment  on at least an annual basis  and be written down when impaired  rather than amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas requires that identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances 
as of december   no indicators of impairment of its goodwill or identifiable intangible assets resulted from emcor s annual impairment review  which was performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the review under sfas also included long term assets related to the united kingdom that were determined not to be impaired 
see note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the provisions of sfas and sfas discussion and analysis of results of operations the reportable segments reflect  in all years presented  reclassifications of certain expenses within the income statement for the prior years and reclassifications of certain business units among the segments due to changes in emcor s internal reporting structure 
revenues as described below in more detail  revenues for increased to billion compared to billion for this revenue growth was principally due to a increased work on united states transportation infrastructure  financial services  healthcare  and hospitality construction projects  b the impact of favorable foreign exchange rate changes on revenues amounting to million in the canada construction and facilities services segment despite reduced revenues as a consequence of certain power generation and healthcare projects having been completed in and amounting to million in the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment  and c an increase in the number of united states site based facilities services contracts 
this growth in revenues was partially offset by reduced revenues from power generation projects  office and manufacturing construction projects  and repair and maintenance work in the united states 
contract backlog as of december  was approximately billion  a billion decrease compared with backlog of approximately billion as of december  backlog is not a term recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  however  it is a common measurement used in emcor s industry 
backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of the facilities services contracts  except if the remaining term of a facilities services contract exceeds months  the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only months of revenues 
the decrease was primarily related to completion of the prior year s backlog  combined with the curtailment in bidding for public sector and other long term contracts 
the decrease in backlog can be expected to result in lower revenues in than in factors such as availability of additional work and the timing thereof  in  may also impact total revenues 
the impact of these factors  however  is not possible to predict with certainty 
the million increase in revenues for when compared to was primarily due to revenues of million from companies acquired in and and to increased revenues in the united states electrical construction and facilities services and united states facilities services segments excluding companies acquired in and of million and million  respectively 
excluding companies acquired in and  revenues for the united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment were lower for than for the following table presents emcor s revenues by operating segment and the approximate percentages that each segment s revenues was of total revenues for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of total total total revenues from unrelated entities united states electrical construction and facilities services    united states mechanical construction and facilities services    united states facilities services total united states operations    canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services total worldwide operations    revenues of the united states electrical construction and facilities services segment for decreased million compared to the decrease in revenues was primarily due to fewer power generation and manufacturing construction projects available  partially offset by an increase in the availability of transportation infrastructure  financial services and hospitality work 
revenues for increased by million compared to this increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transportation infrastructure and power generation work  partially offset by a significant decline in private sector commercial work  which includes offices  manufacturing facilities and hotels 
of all of the major urban centers served by emcor  the new york city area market in experienced the largest reduction in revenues from private sector commercial work compared to this decline in revenues from private sector commercial work when compared to was offset by increased public sector work in the washington dc area market  increased transportation infrastructure work in the denver area and increased power generation and transportation infrastructure work in california 
revenues of the united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment for increased million compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased work on healthcare  hospitality and financial services construction projects  partially offset by decreased power generation work and commercial work  including discretionary small projects and repair and maintenance work 
revenues for increased million compared to principally due to increases in the education and institutional sectors related to increased public sector spending  partially offset by significantly decreased commercial office  manufacturing and power generation work due to a fall off in availability of such work 
in  emcor s mid western markets were particularly negatively impacted by a fall off in available outage upgrade and replacement work at manufacturing facilities 
in addition  revenues in were negatively impacted by declines in small and discretionary projects and repairs and maintenance work caused largely by the cooler than normal summer weather conditions in parts of the united states 
united states facilities services segment revenues increased million for compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased site based facilities services contracts as a result of increased sales efforts 
revenues increased by million for compared to the increase in revenues for was primarily due to revenues of million attributable to the ces acquisition and increased site based facilities services contracts  partially offset by a decline in certain small and discretionary projects due to increased competition resulting in fewer projects awarded to emcor 
additionally  a reduction in demand for mobile services  which services had been adversely affected by cooler than normal summer weather conditions in parts of the united states  contributed to a decrease in revenues 
revenues of canada construction and facilities services decreased by million for compared to this decrease was primarily due to the completion in of certain long term power generation and healthcare projects active in  partially offset by increased revenues from power transmission projects 
the decrease was also partially offset by million of increased revenues resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange for canadian dollars to united states dollars due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
revenues increased by million for as compared to the increase in revenues for was primarily attributable to an increase of million resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange for canadian dollars to united states dollars due to strengthening of the canadian dollar 
but for the exchange rates  canada s construction and facilities services revenues for when compared to would have decreased due to a temporary scale back in work on certain long term power generation projects attributable to a customer s project scheduling 
united kingdom construction and facilities services revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase in revenues was principally due to an increase of million resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange for british pounds to united states dollars because of strengthening of the british pound and to increases in transportation infrastructure work 
revenues increased million for compared to  due to an increase of million related to changes in the rates of exchange for british pounds to united states dollars because of strengthening of the british pound 
but for exchange rates  revenues for would have declined because of implementation of a planned reduction in bidding for certain types of institutional and government sponsored construction projects 
other international construction and facilities services activities consist of operations primarily in south africa until the sale of emcor s interest in a south african joint venture in july and in the middle east 
during  and  all of the projects in these markets were performed by joint ventures  and accordingly  the results of these joint venture operations were accounted for under the equity method of accounting because either emcor had less than majority ownership or was not subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the joint venture activities and was not entitled to receive a majority of the joint venture s residual returns 
accordingly  revenues attributable to such joint ventures were not reflected as revenues in the consolidated financial statements 
emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in the middle eastern and european markets  however  the availability of opportunities there has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents emcor s cost of sales  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages cost of sales    gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross profit revenues less cost of sales decreased million for compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for gross profit for was lower than in the prior year  despite greater revenues than in  primarily due to a greater than originally estimated labor requirements to perform work as well as continued reduced labor productivity due to the uncertain construction job market  b reduced availability of higher margin discretionary small project spending and repair and maintenance work  c increased competition for  and a related decrease in gross profit margin on  commercial  industrial and public sector work in the united states  and d increased prices for material required for certain construction projects  which price increases particularly negatively impacted the canada construction and facilities services segment gross profit 
positively impacting gross profit was improved united kingdom construction and facilities services segment project performance and increased gross profit from united states transportation infrastructure  financial services  healthcare and hospitality projects due to the increased availability and successful performance of these types of projects 
additionally  total gross profit increased million in compared to  primarily resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange for british pounds to united states dollars amounting to million  partially offset by a million decrease resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange for canadian dollars to united states dollars 
gross profit decreased million for compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for compared with for gross profit as a percentage of revenues for compared to decreased primarily due to poor performance in the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment and the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above  this decline was offset in part by million of gross profit attributable to the companies acquired in and selling  general and administrative expenses the following table presents emcor s selling  general and administrative expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million compared to selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for compared to for this decline in selling  general and administrative expenses both in dollars and as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel 
the decrease was offset by an increase of million for compared to resulting from the impact of changes in the rates of exchange for united kingdom and canadian currencies to united states dollars  and an increase of million in expense for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to as a percentage of revenues  total selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in for  selling  general and administrative expenses included amortization expense of million attributable to identifiable intangible assets associated with acquisitions compared to million for selling  general and administrative expenses excluding companies acquired in and and related amortization expense for were approximately million of revenues compared to million of revenues for this decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was attributable to a managed reduction of both variable expenses including reduced incentive compensation related to less favorable financial performance and reduction in personnel and fixed expenses such as building occupancy costs 
restructuring expenses restructuring expenses  primarily relating to employee severance obligations  were million for approximately million of the restructuring obligations were paid prior to december  emcor anticipates paying substantially all of the remaining obligations in there were no restructuring expenses for the year ended december  or gain on sale of assets and equity investment the gain on sale of assets of million for the year ended december  was related to the september sale of assets of emcor s united kingdom delcommerce equipment rental services division 
contemporaneously with the sale  emcor entered into a long term agreement to utilize the equipment rental services of the purchaser  a publicly traded united kingdom company 
the million gain on sale of an equity investment of was attributable to the august sale of emcor s interest in a south african joint venture  the operating results of which had been reported previously in the other international segment 
there were no sales of assets or equity investments in either or other than the disposal of property  plant and equipment in the normal course of business 
operating income the following table presents emcor s operating income by segment  and each segment s operating income as a percentage of its segment s revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of segment segment segment revenues revenues revenues operating income loss united states electrical construction and facilities services united states mechanical construction and facilities services united states facilities services total united states operations canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services corporate administration restructuring expense gain on sale of assets total worldwide operations other corporate items interest expense interest income gain on sale of equity investment minority interest income before taxes as described in more detail below  operating income was million for  million for and million for operating income decreased million compared to  primarily due to restructuring expenses of million 
excluding restructuring expenses of million and a gain on the sale of assets of million  operating income increased million compared to operating income for was also impacted by other factors previously discussed in the overview above 
the decrease in operating income compared to operating income was primarily attributable to the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above  and operating losses from the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment 
operating income was favorably impacted by million  million and million in reduction of insurance liabilities previously established for insurance exposures as a consequence of effective risk management and safety programs for  and  respectively 
united states electrical construction and facilities services operating income for increased million compared to this segment s increased operating income in was attributable principally to increased gross profit on transportation infrastructure  financial services  and hospitality construction projects due to the increased availability and successful performance of these types of projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in due to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel 
the decrease in operating income for of million as compared to  and the related decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues  was primarily attributable to the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above 
in  the new york city area market was particularly adversely impacted by a significant decline in commercial work and by unprofitable performance of power generation work 
the overall decrease was partially offset by profitable performance of transportation infrastructure  certain power generation work and project close outs 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses excluding that attributable to companies acquired in compared to decreased by approximately million 
this decrease was mostly related to a reduction in incentive compensation  which was attributable to less favorable financial performance  a reduction in personnel and a reduction in other variable expenses 
the united states mechanical construction and facilities services operating loss for was million compared to operating income of million for the segment s operating loss was primarily attributable to a decreases in the expected recovery of estimated costs upon completion of certain projects  principally in the western united states  b poor contract performance on certain construction work related to greater labor requirements than originally estimated to perform the work and continued reduced labor productivity due to the uncertain construction job market  c a continued decrease in the availability of generally more profitable discretionary small projects and repair and maintenance work due to general economic conditions negatively impacting commercial construction spending  and d increased competition for  and a related decrease in gross profit margin on  commercial  industrial and public sector work 
partially offsetting these operating results were decreased selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel and to reduced incentive compensation due to less favorable financial performance 
this segment s operating income decreased by million for compared to this decrease in operating income and decrease as a percentage of revenues for was primarily due to the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above 
the mid western markets were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in available work on manufacturing projects  the western markets were negatively impacted by reduced income from power generation work  and other united states markets were negatively impacted by reduced repairs and maintenance work caused largely by the cooler than normal summer weather conditions 
this decrease in operating income was partially offset by increased income from additional water and wastewater treatment facilities projects for compared to in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million in this segment for compared to this decrease was mostly related to a reduction in incentive compensation related to less favorable financial performance  reduction in personnel and reduction in other variable expenses 
united states facilities services operating income for decreased million compared to the reduced operating income was primarily related to a decrease in revenues from  and profits earned on  discretionary small projects and repair and maintenance work due to general economic conditions negatively impacting commercial construction spending and an increase in expenses for site based facilities services business development 
in addition  during this segment also incurred approximately million of losses on certain construction projects  outside of the normal facilities services operations of this segment  that were contracted for by a subsidiary in this segment prior to its acquisition by emcor 
the decrease in operating income for was partially offset by a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses related to lower salary costs and other variable costs associated with reductions in personnel 
united states facilities services operating income increased by million for compared to the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to income of million from ces and an increase in the number of site based facilities services contracts resulting from business development activities 
the increase was partially offset by reduced income from certain small and discretionary projects due to increased competition and from mobile services  which services were adversely affected by cooler than normal summer weather conditions in parts of the united states 
canada construction and facilities services operating loss for was million compared to operating income of million for the losses were primarily due to greater labor requirements than originally estimated to perform certain projects  increased material prices and the completion of certain long term power generation projects in not present in the impact of exchange rate movements increased operating losses by million for compared to canada construction and facilities services operating income decreased by million for compared to this decrease was principally due to a increased hospital and school construction projects and less manufacturing outage work in compared to  since hospital and school construction projects generally have lower gross profits than the manufacturing outage work and b decreased profit from several longer term power generation projects 
the decline was offset in part by million of an increase in operating income resulting from the impact of the change in exchange rates due to strengthening of the canadian dollar 
united kingdom construction and facilities services operating income was breakeven for compared to an operating loss of million for this improvement was primarily attributable to an improvement in the gross profit as there was profitable performance of work in in contrast to contracts causing large losses in  which contracts were substantially completed by december  the improvement in operating income was also attributable to reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses related to a reorganization of the united kingdom operations in late united kingdom construction and facilities services reported a million operating loss in compared to breakeven results for the operating loss was primarily attributable to a net unfa vorable settlements and closeouts of certain construction projects completed during that year  b increased bad debt expense of million in primarily related to the potential non payment of a large customer account receivable which account receivable was written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in  c reorganization expenses of approximately million related to employee severance expenses and the closing of several offices  and d million resulting from the impact of the change in exchange rates due to strengthening of the british pound 
other international construction and facilities services operating income was million for compared to operating income of million for and million of operating loss for emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in the middle eastern and european markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
general corporate expenses for increased by million compared to and increased by million for compared to general corporate expenses for compared to have been negatively impacted by higher audit fees and other costs of complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of however  these increased costs have been largely offset by other expense reductions 
the increase in general corporate expenses for compared to was primarily related to an increase in personnel required to support the business growth related to acquisitions and increased marketing expenses associated with emcor s brand awareness campaign  which promotes the emcor brand in the united states on the national and local level 
interest expense was million for both and the decrease in borrowings under emcor s revolving credit facility for was offset by the impact of increases in interest rates during the year 
interest expense increased by million in compared to principally due to increased borrowing under emcor s revolving credit facility as a result of the acquisition of ces 
interest income increased by million for compared to due to interest earned on cash provided by the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment  as such cash was invested in the united kingdom at interest rates greater than the net cost of borrowing under emcor s revolving credit facility 
interest income decreased by million for compared to due to repayment of increased borrowings for working capital under emcor s revolving credit facility 
the income tax benefit of less than million for was comprised of a million of income tax provision on pre tax earnings of million  b million of income tax provision related to a valuation allowance recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences of the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment inasmuch as there is uncertainty of sufficient future income to realize the benefit of such deferred tax assets and c the partial offset of such income tax provisions by million of income tax benefits for income tax reserves no longer required based on current analysis of probable exposures 
the provision on income before income taxes for  and was recorded at an effective income tax rate of approximately 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents emcor s net cash provided by used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december  and in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities the company s consolidated cash balance decreased by million from million at december  to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for was million  an increase of million from net cash provided by operating activities of million for the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net income of million  a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of million and a million decrease related to other items 
this increase in cash provided by operating activities was in contrast to the cash provided by operating activities of million in  as was impacted by the shift toward increased public sector work  which work typically involves larger projects and significant working capital requirements until initial billing milestones can be reached 
net cash used in investing activities in of million consisted primarily of earn out payments of million for acquisitions in prior periods  net disbursements for other investments of million and million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  offset by million of proceeds from the sale of assets and an equity investment and million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
this activity compares to net cash used in investing activities for of million  which consisted primarily of aggregate payments of million for acquisitions in and earn out payments of million for acquisitions in prior periods  net disbursements for other investments of million and million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  offset by million of payments received pursuant to indemnity provisions of acquisition agreements and million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for of million was primarily attributable to net payments under working capital credit lines of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for of million was primarily attributable to net borrowings under working capital credit lines of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  offset by repayments of long term debt of million 
the following is a summary of emcor s material contractual obligations and other commercial commitments in millions payments due by period less contractual than after obligations total year years years years other long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases minimum funding requirement for pension plan open purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration by period total less other commercial amounts than after commitments committed year years years years revolving credit facility letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments represents open purchase orders for material and subcontracting costs related to emcor s construction and service contracts 
these purchase orders are not reflected in emcor s consolidated balance sheet and should not impact future cash flows as amounts will be recovered through customer billings 
represents primarily insurance related liabilities  the timing for which payments beyond one year is not practical to estimate 
emcor classifies these borrowings as short term on its consolidated balance sheet because of emcor s intent and ability to repay the amounts on a short term basis 
on september   emcor entered into a million five year revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility 
effective july   emcor increased its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to million 
the revolving credit facility  which replaced a credit facility entered into on december   is guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of emcor  is secured by substantially all of the assets of emcor and most of its subsidiaries and provides for borrowings in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility

in august  the company s canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  renewed a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million 
the facility is secured by a standby letter of credit and provides for interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  or a subsidiary of emcor has guaranteed indebtedness of a venture in which it has a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning private and public properties

emcor is contingently liable to sureties in respect of performance and payment bonds issued by sureties  usually at the request of customers in connection with construction projects which secure emcor payment and performance obligations under contracts for such projects 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain emcor employees  bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
emcor bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases

the bonds are issued by emcor s sureties in return for a premium which varies depending on the size and type of the bonds 
the largest individual bond is approximately million

the primary source of liquidity for emcor has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
emcor also maintains the revolving credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable emcor to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
emcor may also increase liquidity through an equity offering or other debt instruments 
short term changes in macroeconomic trends may have an effect  positively or negatively  on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  emcor s focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns as the facilities services market is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction market 
the acquisition in december of ces  which is primarily focused on the facilities services market  is part of emcor s plan to grow its facilities services business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during economic downturns  such as the through period for the commercial construction industry  there are typically fewer small and discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies such as emcor more aggressively bid more large long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires working capital until initial billing milestones are achieved 
while emcor strives to maintain a net over billed position with its customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained 
emcor s net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities  the revolving credit facility  and the sale of various secured or unsecured debt and or equity interests in the public and private markets 
based upon emcor s current credit ratings and financial position  emcor can reasonably expect to be able to issue long term debt instruments and or equity 
over the long term  emcor s primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition to the primary revenue risk factor  emcor s ability to perform work at profitable levels is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
emcor believes that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available through debt or equity offerings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  emcor is a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from it amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if emcor was required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and or cash flows

new accounting pronouncement on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  emcor will adopt statement r on july  as permitted by statement  emcor currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial posi tion 
emcor is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of statement r will have on the results of operations in the impact of the standard on future operating results cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
statement r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while emcor cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk emcor has not used derivative financial instruments for any purpose during the years ended december  and  including trading or speculating on changes in interest rates or commodity prices of materials used in its business 
emcor is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under that facility bear interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this borrowing is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there was million of borrowings outstanding under the facility  and these borrowings bear interest at a a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris nesbitt from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or b united states dollar libor at december   the rate was plus to  based on certain financial tests 
based on the borrowings outstanding of million  if the overall interest rates were to increase by  the net of tax interest expense would increase approximately million in the next twelve months 
conversely  if the overall interest rates were to decrease by  interest expense would decrease by approximately million in the next twelve months 
the revolving credit facility expires in september there is no guarantee that emcor will be able to renew the facility at its expiration 
emcor is also exposed to market risk and the market s potential related impact on accounts receivable or costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the amounts recorded may be at risk if customers ability to pay these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions

amounts invested in emcor s foreign operations are translated into u 
s 
dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end

emcor believes the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on its consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective local currencies 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in their same local currencies
