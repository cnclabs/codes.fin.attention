the company records sales for the cost of steel sold to the customer plus a mark up and records the cost of the steel in cost of sales 
this accounting treatment is consistent with emerging issues task force eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company acts as principal in the transaction  takes title to the products  and has risks and rewards of ownership

this accounting treatment is consistent with eitf no 
accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is determined using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years for machinery and equipment 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lives of the leases or estimated useful lives of the assets  whichever is less 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
when assets are sold or otherwise retired  the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the books and the resulting gain or loss is included in other income and expense

valuation of deferred tax assets 
because the company operates in different geographic locations  including several state and local tax jurisdictions  the nature of the company s tax provisions and the evaluation of the company s ability to use all recognized deferred tax assets are complex 
in assessing the ability to realize such deferred tax assets  the company reviews the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the projections of taxable income in future periods and the effectiveness of various tax planning strategies in making assessments 
the consideration of these matters requires significant management judgment in determining deferred tax asset valuation allowances

the company records goodwill when the cost exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired 
as required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments

historically  with the exception of million of bad debt expense recorded in related to the national steel bankruptcy and million in related to the rouge steel bankruptcy  and million in relate to the stelco bankruptcy  bad debt losses have not been significant or have not differed materially from the company s estimates 
the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets including investments in accordance with sfas  based on an evaluation of remaining useful lives and upon the estimated cash flows to be generated by these assets 
the impairment review is generally triggered when such events as a significant industry downturn  product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when such events occur  the company evaluates the book value against the fair value of the assets
