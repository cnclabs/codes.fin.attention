item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview the company began seeing signs that a recovery of the electronics industries in north america was underway in the third quarter of as supplier pricing began to firm  component lead times began to stretch out and customer backlog began to grow 
these signs of improvement continued through the second quarter of as sales for the second quarter of represented the company s fifth sequential quarterly sales increase 
at the end of the second quarter  however  the industry began slowing and the company has experienced sequential declines in its sales levels 
management believes that in the third quarter of customers began experiencing increases in inventory levels as end markets were not growing as fast as expected and product availability was not as tight as originally anticipated 
in response  during the third quarter of customers began reducing their purchasing levels 
our backlog of customer orders  which grew from million at december  to million at june   began to trend downward during the third quarter of and was million at december  in  the global semiconductor market was billion compared to billion for  representing a increase 
the growth experienced in was across all regions 
the second half of  however  reflected a deceleration in the growth rate for the global semiconductor industry 
the global semiconductor market grew   and year over year for each of the first through the fourth quarters of as compared to the same periods of while we expect that the future growth in global markets will include growth in the americas  the company believes that growth rates will be higher in foreign markets 
to support this trend  the company is continuing its efforts to increase its offshore presence 
the company has operations in the united kingdom and hungary to support european markets and in korea  malaysia and china to support asian markets 
the company expects to expand further into these territories 
sales to customer locations in european and asian markets aggregated million for compared to million for there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any growth in any particular market in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes  a postretirement benefit obligation and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgement  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue for the company is typically recognized at time of shipment as the company does not have any performance obligations beyond shipment to its customers 
prices for purchases are negotiated by the company with its suppliers 
prices for sales are negotiated by the company with its customers 
customers are typically required to pay the company for sales within days of shipment to the customer 
the company offers rebates to certain customers based on the volume of products purchased 
the company follows emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products and  accordingly  any rebate obligations are deducted from revenues 
in addition  while substantially all of the company s sales are final  a very limited number of customers have contractual rights to return product based upon a percentage of their purchases 
furthermore  from time to time as a result of special and or extenuating circumstances  a very small amount of sales are returned 
as a result  the company reserves for returns as a deduction against revenues 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon historical experience and is reviewed and adjusted as appropriate 
most of the company s product sales come from products that it purchases from a supplier and holds in inventory 
a portion of the company s business is drop shipments which involve shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in all transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment terms by the company to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer to the company  and product returns from the customer to the company  and the company has the risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  the company recognizes revenue on a drop shipment when the company is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
the company also maintains consignment inventory 
under consignment programs product is shipped to a consignee customer so that such product is available for the consignee s use when they are required 
the consignee may or may not be obligated to purchase the consigned inventory and in some instances maintains a right to return unused product that is shipped under the consignment inventory program 
revenue is not recognized from products shipped on consignment until notification is received from the company s consignee customer that the customer has accepted title of and consumed the inventory that was shipped initially on consignment 
the product shipped on consignment in which title has not been accepted by the customer is included in the company s inventories and is not included in revenue 
the company s accounts receivable are due from a broad range of customers 
the company extends credit based on ongoing evaluations of its customers financial condition and payment history 
accounts receivable are generally due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is a deterioration of our customers creditworthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on an average cost basis or market 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions as well as the company s distribution agreements with its suppliers  which generally provide for price protection and obsolescence credits  inventories are written down to market value 
due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and obsolescence credits  estimates  based upon assumptions about future demand  selling prices and market conditions  are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
if our assumptions about future demand change  and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
deferred tax assets are recorded based on the company s projected future taxable income and the resulting utilization of the deferred tax assets 
to the extent that the company would not be able to realize in the future all or part of its deferred tax assets  which aggregated  at december   an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be necessary and charged to income 
the company calculates a postretirement benefit obligation using actuarial life expectancy tables and an assumed discount rate 
if the assumptions used in this calculation change  an adjustment to the postretirement benefit obligation may be required 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product  intellectual property  environmental and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in determining loss contingencies  we evaluate the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of such loss 
we accrue for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated

the company s effective interest rate was adversely impacted by five interest rate hikes by the federal reserve board between june  and december   which raised the federal funds rate by basis points 
this adverse effect was offset by improvements in the pricing levels on borrowings under the company s million credit facility  as amended  which expires may  the credit facility and the repayment of fixed rate debt utilizing borrowings under the credit facility at a lower rate

as the company has historically been successful in refinancing its line of credit facilities  management expects to refinance its present credit facility prior to its expiration in may off balance sheet arrangements the company continues to guarantee the future payment to a third party of certain leases which were previously pledged to the company as collateral for the payment of outstanding receivables which were owed by a customer 
this guaranty was made when the leases were sold to this third party who paid to the company in the net present value of the future payments of the leases

the company plans to seek recovery from the lessees for any amounts that the company pays under its guaranty 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in recovering any amounts paid under its guaranty 
at december  the maximum additional exposure under this guaranty  which continues through the latest lease expiration date of march   was  with a net present value of  inflation and currency fluctuations the company does not believe that inflation significantly impacted its business during  however  inflation has had significant effects on the economy in the past and could adversely impact the company s results in the future 
the company believes that currency fluctuations could adversely impact its financial results in the future if the company increases transactions in foreign currencies and or adds offshore infrastructure which is paid for in foreign currencies 
the company believes that currency fluctuations could have adverse effects on its business if the impact from those currency fluctuations makes components manufactured abroad too expensive  causes limitations in customer productions due to unfavorable export conditions or causes the company s offshore suppliers to limit exports to the united states 
in certain prior years  the company believes that currency fluctuations have had such adverse effects 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations could result in increasing the cost of goods of the company or reducing its net sales as purchase and sale prices for the company s goods fixed in foreign currency may result in the cost of goods in us dollars being greater when paid or net sales in us dollars on payment for goods being less when received than anticipated when the price payable or to be received in foreign currency is originally fixed

these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  the words believes  estimates  plans  expects  intends  anticipates  contemplates  may  will  shall  assuming  prospect  should  could  looking forward and similar expressions  to the extent used  are intended to identify the forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results suggested in this report 
in many cases  we cannot predict the risks or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences  and our business risks generally  include  but are not limited to  the items described below  as well as in other sections of this report and in other of our public filings and in our press releases 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements  business risks and or uncertainties 
our industry is cyclical  which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
we cannot predict the timing or the severity of the cycles within our industry 
in particular  it is difficult to predict how long and to what levels any industry slowdown or downturn and or general economic weakness will last or be exacerbated by terrorism or war or other factors or  alternatively  the likelihood of an industry upturn or the period of time it will last 
the electronic components distribution industry has historically been affected by general economic downturns  which have often had an adverse economic effect upon manufacturers  end users of electronic components and electronic components distributors 
in addition  our industry directly depends on the continued growth of the electronic components industry and indirectly on the level of end user demand for our customers products 
due to changing conditions  our customer base has experienced and may in the future experience periods of inventory corrections which could materially adversely impact our results 
furthermore  the timing of new product developments  the life cycle of existing electronic products  and the level of acceptance and growth of new products can affect demand for electronic components 
in that regard  the company has supported in the past and expects in the future to support new technologies and emerging markets  the failure of which to be accepted or grow could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
these market changes and factors have caused in the past  and will likely cause in the future  our operating results to significantly fluctuate 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
if one or more of our largest suppliers chooses not to sell products to us  our operating results could suffer 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for products which generate a significant portion of our sales 
substantially all of our inventory has and will be purchased from suppliers with which we have entered into non exclusive distributor agreements which are typically cancelable on short notice generally to days 
products purchased from our three largest suppliers accounted for approximately of our consolidated purchases during the calendar year ended december   of which were purchased from one supplier 
no other supplier accounted for more than five percent of our consolidated purchases during this period 
while most of the products that we sell are available from other sources  our future success will depend in large part on maintaining relationships with existing suppliers and developing relationships with new ones 
we believe that the loss of a key supplier particularly our largest supplier could have a material adverse impact on our business in the short term as we attempt to replace the products offered by that supplier with the products of other suppliers 
however  if we were to lose our right to distribute the products of any particular supplier  there can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the products which were available from that particular supplier 
thus  the loss of  or significant disruptions in relationships with  any of our largest suppliers particularly our largest supplier or a significant number of other suppliers in a short period of time  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers and  as a result  our customers may be able to cancel  reduce or delay their orders without penalty 
we typically do not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments but instead work with our customers to develop nonbinding forecasts of future orders 
based on such nonbinding forecasts  we make commitments regarding the level of business that we will seek and accept  and the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources 
a variety of conditions  both specific to each individual customer and generally affecting each customer s industry  may cause our customers to cancel  reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated or attempt to return inventory 
generally  our customers may cancel  reduce or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty or other charges associated with such cancellation  reduction or delay 
significant or numerous cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may not be able to sustain or manage growth or achieve satisfactory levels of profitability 
as and to the extent market conditions improve  we will need to manage our expanding operations including our developing european and asian operations effectively and successfully integrate into our operations that expansion and any new businesses or divisions which we may acquire or open 
if we are unable to do so  particularly in instances in which we have made or make significant investments  our failure could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in growing and achieving satisfactory levels of profitability if we are unable to secure adequate supplies of competitive products on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable prices and other terms  especially in times of product allocations  expand sales to existing customers and increase our customer base  turn our inventories and collect our accounts receivable fully and in a timely manner  especially with respect to customers in new technologies or in emerging markets and generally as a result of the weakened or any further weakening financial condition of certain customers including several customer bankruptcies  avoid obsolescence of inventory or devaluation of inventory as a result of adverse market conditions  maintain our existing key supplier relationships as well as develop new relationships with leading suppliers of electronic components  hire and retain additional qualified management  marketing and other personnel to successfully manage our growth  including personnel to monitor our operations  control costs and maintain effective inventory and credit controls  effectively and fully utilize our level of personnel and facility and infrastructure overcapacity  and invest to maintain and enhance our infrastructure  including telecommunications and information systems  enterprise resource planning erp system  logistics services and our service capabilities  including distribution technology 
a decline in gross profit margins arising from a change in market conditions or aggressive pricing programs could adversely affect our operating results 
during certain prior periods  we have experienced an increase in gross profit margins as a result of favorable market conditions in the electronic components distribution industry  including limited supply of certain products 
however  there is no assurance that negative changes in the economic environment generally and or in the electronic components industry in particular will not occur 
furthermore  we continue to develop long term strategic relationships with accounts which have required aggressive pricing programs  as well as there is continued price competition for products sold by us 
these and other factors such as increases in low margin  large volume transactions and a change in our product mix could result in a decline in our gross profit margins  materially adversely affecting our operating results 
we may not be able to satisfy our funding requirements 
we currently anticipate needing to spend significant amounts of cash to meet our working capital requirements including to support increases in levels of inventory  as well as customer backlog  and accounts receivable as our level of sales increases  invest in capital equipment and infrastructure  upgrade our information and communication systems  including our new enterprise resource planning erp system  acquire businesses or open divisions  or respond to increases in expenses and costs  unanticipated developments  increasing customer demands or competitive pressures 
if we do not have enough cash on hand  cash generated from our operations and or cash available under our credit facility to meet these cash requirements  we will need to seek alternative sources of financing to carry out our growth and operating strategies  particularly if our credit facility is not available to do so 
we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive 
if alternative sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable  we will be required to modify our operating plans to the extent of available funding  if and assuming such modifications and or other actions can be made or taken at all 
our global expansion initiatives may not be successful 
the company has commenced global expansion initiatives in an attempt to increase its sales to customers locations in foreign countries 
given the company s limited experience in the international market and that the company only fairly recently  and on a limited basis so far  commenced operations outside of north america  no assurance can be given that the company s global expansion initiatives will be successful 
we are exposed to interest rate changes which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to our credit facility  which currently is based upon  at our option  the prime rate or libor 
no assurance can be given that interest rates will not continue to rise 
any material increase in the level of interest rates could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we are dependent on foreign manufacturers and subject to trade regulations which expose us to political and economic risk 
a significant number of components sold by us are manufactured by foreign companies 
as a result  our ability to sell certain products at competitive prices could be adversely affected by any of the following increases in tariffs or duties  changes in trade treaties  strikes or delays in air or sea transportation  future united states legislation with respect to pricing and or import quotas on products imported from foreign countries  and turbulence in offshore economies or financial markets 
our ability to be competitive with respect to sales of imported components could also be affected by other governmental actions and policy changes  including anti dumping and other international antitrust legislation 
in addition  adverse currency fluctuations could have the effect of making components manufactured abroad more expensive  cause limitations in customer productions due to unfavorable export conditions or cause our offshore suppliers to limit exports to the united states 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations could result in increasing the cost of goods to us or reducing our net sales as purchase and sale prices for our goods fixed in foreign currency may result in the cost of goods in us dollars being greater when paid or net sales in us dollars on payment for goods being less when received than anticipated when the price payable or to be received in foreign currency is originally fixed 
because we historically purchase substantially all of our products from united states subsidiaries and affiliates of foreign manufacturers  almost all of our purchases are paid for in us dollars  which usually reduces or eliminates the potential adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
however  in late we began purchasing a limited amount less than of total purchases for of our product offshore and this offshore purchasing activity may increase in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such factors could not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future 
our global expansion initiatives expose us to a variety of risks which could adversely affect our operating results 
our sales to customers locations in foreign countries increased to million for up from million in due to our global expansion initiatives 
our global operations are subject to a variety of risks including the following limited experience in markets outside of north america  foreign currency fluctuations  political and economic instability  the burden and cost of complying with foreign laws  changes to foreign laws and regulations  import and export duties and value added taxes  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and unpredictable sales cycles 
our foreign subsidiaries currently conduct substantially all of their business in us dollars 
as we expand our global initiative we may be required to transact business in the local currency of the customers location 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could lead to a reduction in sales or profitability 
to the extent revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars may contribute to fluctuation in our operating results 
our new enterprise resource planning erp system could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our operations could be adversely affected if and when the new erp system is implemented if the new erp system does not perform as anticipated 
if there is a failed implementation of the new erp system  then service to the company s customers and suppliers could be adversely impacted 
the strain on the company s employees  as well as on its financial resources  may be significant for a period of time in connection with this new erp system and the implementation thereof 
our industry is subject to supply shortages 
any delay or inability to obtain components may have an adverse effect on our operating results 
during certain prior periods there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry and the availability of certain components have been limited by some of our suppliers 
although such shortages and allocations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results  there can be no assurance that any future shortages or allocations would not have such an effect on us 
the prices of our components are subject to volatility 
a significant portion of the memory products we sell have historically experienced volatile pricing 
if market pricing for these products decreases significantly  we may experience periods when our investment in inventory exceeds the market price of such products 
in addition  at times there are price increases from our suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
these market conditions could have a negative impact on our sales and gross profit margins unless and until our suppliers reduce the cost of these products to us 
further  in the future aggressive pricing programs that may be required  an increased number of low margin  large volume transactions and or increased availability of the supply of certain products can further impact gross profit margins 
our industry is highly competitive and competition could harm our ability to sell our products and services and thereby reduce our market share 
the electronic components distribution industry is highly competitive 
we generally compete with local  regional and national distributors 
some of our competitors have greater name recognition and financial  personnel and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully with existing or new competitors and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
emergence of new competitive business models or sources of competition could have adverse effects on our business 
additional competition has emerged in the electronic components distribution industry 
this increased competition resulted in part from the advent of third party logistics and fulfillment companies  businesses commonly referred to as e exchanges and e brokers and several other forms of e commerce companies which have grown with the expanded use of the internet 
in addition to the increased competition from these other groups  some of the total available distribution market share is being reduced as more and more original equipment manufacturers transition their procurement into ems companies and original design manufacturers 
the ems companies and original design manufacturers utilize their abilities to aggregate demand to develop direct purchasing channels with component manufacturers 
furthermore  as more and more manufacturing moves outside the boundaries of north america  the company believes that the total available distribution market share is also being reduced as procurement channels increase in asia and europe 
while we have implemented our e commerce strategies  including our website and multiple portals  and commenced operations in europe and asia to confront certain of these new business models and sources of competition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend our market share against the emergence of these or other new business models and sources of competition 
a reversal of the trend for distribution to play an increasing role in the electronic components industry could affect our business 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend for original equipment manufacturers and contract electronics manufacturers to outsource their procurement  inventory and materials management processes to third parties  particularly electronic component distributors 
although we do not currently foresee this trend reversing  if it did  our business would be materially adversely affected 
our operations would be adversely affected if third party carriers were unable to transport or were materially hindered in transporting our products 
all of our products are shipped through third party carriers  principally one carrier 
if a strike or other event prevented or materially hindered or disrupted that carrier from transporting our products  there is no assurance that other carriers would be available or have the capacity to deliver our products to our customers 
if adequate third party sources to ship our products were not available at any time  our operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on the continued services of our executive officers  and their loss could affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
we are highly dependent upon the services of our president and chief executive officer 
the permanent loss for any reason of our president and chief executive officer  or any one or more of our other key executives  could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 
while we believe that we would be able to locate suitable replacements for our executives if their services were lost  there can be no assurance that we would  in fact  be able to do so 
we must attract and retain personnel to help support our future growth  and competition for personnel in our industry has previously been intense 
we require the services of a substantial number of qualified personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management  engineering  sales  marketing  information technology  distribution and finance personnel 
during certain prior periods  the market for such skilled and experienced personnel was characterized by intense competition and aggressive recruiting  as well as a high degree of employee mobility 
such a market  if it was to return  would make it particularly difficult to attract and retain the qualified personnel we require 
the loss of or our inability to continue to attract and retain these key personnel could harm our business 
we may be exposed to product liability claims 
we are likely to be named as a defendant in any products liability action brought by an end user as a result of our value added services or as a participant in the distribution chain between the manufacturer and end user 
although as of this date there are no material claims asserted against us for products liability  there can be no assurance that such claims will not arise in the future 
in the event that any products liability claim is not covered by insurance or we are not indemnified by or cannot recover damages from our supplier of the product or another third party in the chain of distribution  we may be required to fund some or all of a product liability claim  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be exposed to warranty claims 
the company may be exposed to warranty claims by its customers both with respect to products manufactured by others which the company distributes and with respect to products on which the company has performed value added work 
with respect to claims relating to products manufactured by others  the company would expect that the manufacturers of such products would indemnify the company as well as defend such claims on the company s behalf to the extent provided for under its agreement with the manufacturer  although no assurance can be given that any manufacturer would so do 
in addition  there may be instances where a customer might be able to enforce an express or implied warranty claim against the company with respect to products manufactured by the company s suppliers 
with respect to products manufactured or assembled by third party companies for aved memory products  the company offers a warranty for a period of one year against defects in workmanship and materials under normal use and service 
accordingly  a significant number of such warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing the company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
we will be required to comply with these rules with respect to our fiscal year ending december  if our independent auditors interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented  operated or reviewed  they may decline to attest to management s assessment or issue a qualified report 
additionally  if we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq stock market 
any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
any acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations 
our growth in the future may depend  in part  on our ability to acquire compatible electronic components distributors or other businesses and to integrate the acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate additional appropriate acquisition candidates  or that we will be successful in acquiring any identified candidates 
in addition and as we have experienced in the past  we cannot be certain that the operations of any acquired companies will be effectively integrated or prove profitable 
the completion of future acquisitions may require the expenditure of sizable amounts of capital and management effort 
moreover  unexpected problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our officers and directors have and will continue to have significant control over us 
if the company s chairman and president and chief executive officer exercised all of their outstanding stock options  they and their respective spouses and children and related trusts would own as of december  an aggregate of approximately  shares  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result of such stock ownership and their positions as executive officers  as the members of the executive committee of our board of directors and as two of the eight directors of the company  they are and will continue to be in a position to control the day to day affairs of the company 
our shareholder rights plan  preferred stock and governing documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our business 
we have a shareholders rights plan and have authorized preferred stock which is available to be issued with such rights  preferences  privileges and limitations as are determined by the board of directors 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation includes provisions designed to discourage attempts by others to acquire control of us without negotiation with our board of directors  and to attempt to ensure that such transactions are on terms favorable to all of our shareholders 
these provisions provide  among other things that meetings of our shareholders may only be called by the board of directors  that an affirmative vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock is required to approve certain business combinations unless of our board approves such transaction  for three classes of directors with each class elected for a three year staggered term  that our board in evaluating a tender offer or certain business combinations is authorized to give due consideration to all relevant factors  and that actions of shareholders may not be taken by written consent of shareholders in lieu of a meeting 
for various reasons  however  these provisions may not always be in the best interest of our shareholders 
these reasons include the fact that the provisions of our certificate of incorporation i make it difficult to remove directors even if removal would be in the best interest of our shareholders  ii make it difficult for our shareholders to approve certain transactions that are not approved by at least of our board  even if the transactions would be beneficial to our shareholders  and iii eliminate the ability of our shareholders to act without a meeting 
our shareholder rights plan  our blank check preferred stock and our governing documents may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company  could discourage potential investors from bidding for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and could adversely affect the market price and the voting rights of the holders of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s credit facility bears interest based on interest rates tied to the prime or libor rate  either of which may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions 
as a result  the company is subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and could be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
if market interest rates increase  the impact may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
for each basis point fluctuation in the interest rates charged on the company s borrowings under its credit facility  interest expense will increase or decrease by  per annum based on outstanding borrowings at december  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources
