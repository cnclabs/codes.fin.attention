item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
investment and operating policies we provide capital to hotel owners and operators who wish to divest their properties while remaining in the hotel business 
many other public hotel reits seek to control the operations of hotels in which they invest and generally design their management agreements or leases to capture substantially all net operating revenues from their hotels 
we do not operate any hotels 
our agreements with our unaffiliated operators and tenants are designed with the expectation that  over their terms  net operating revenues from our hotels will exceed minimum amounts due to us 
we believe that these differences in operating philosophy may afford us a competitive advantage over other hotel reits in finding high quality hotel investment opportunities on attractive terms and increase the dependability of our cash flows used to pay distributions 
our investment objectives include increasing per share distributions and cash flow from operations from dependable and diverse sources 
to achieve these objectives  we seek to operate as follows maintain a strong capital base of shareholders equity  invest in high quality properties operated by unaffiliated hotel operating companies  use moderate debt leverage to fund additional investments which increase cash flow from operations because of positive spreads between our cost of investment capital and investment yields  structure investments which generate a minimum return and provide an opportunity to participate in a percentage of operating growth at our hotels  when market conditions permit  refinance debt with additional equity or long term debt  and pursue diversification so that our cash flow from operations is received from diverse properties and operators 
in order to benefit from potential property appreciation  we prefer to own properties rather than make mortgage investments 
we may invest in real estate joint ventures if we conclude that we may benefit from the participation of co venturers or that the opportunity to participate in the investment is contingent on the use of a joint venture structure 
we may invest in participating  convertible or other types of mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or appreciation in the value of the mortgaged property 
convertible mortgages are similar to equity participation because they permit lenders to either participate in increasing revenues from the property or convert some or all of that mortgage into equity ownership interests 
at december   we owned no convertible mortgages or joint venture interests 
we may not achieve some or all of our investment objectives 
because we are a reit  generally  we may not operate hotels 
we or our tenants have entered into arrangements for operation of our hotels 
as described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  tax law changes known as the reit modernization act  or the rma  were enacted and became effective january  the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to a taxable reit subsidiary if the hotel is managed by an independent third party 
as of december   of our hotels are leased to our taxable reit subsidiaries and managed by independent third parties 
any income realized by a taxable reit subsidiary in excess of the rent paid to us by the subsidiary will be subject to income tax at customary corporate rates 
as  and if  the financial performance of the hotels operated for the account of our taxable reit subsidiaries improves  these taxes may become material  but the anticipated taxes are not material to our consolidated financial results at this time 
acquisition policies we intend to pursue growth through the acquisition of additional hotels 
generally  we prefer to purchase multiple hotels in one transaction because we believe a single agreement  cross default covenants and all or none renewal rights for multiple hotels in diverse locations enhance the credit characteristics and the security of our investments 
in implementing our acquisition strategy  we consider a range of factors relating to proposed hotel purchases including i historical and projected cash flows  ii the competitive market environment and the current or potential market position of each hotel  iii the availability of a qualified operator or lessee  iv the financial strength of the proposed operator or lessee  v the amount and type of financial support available from the proposed operator or lessee  vi the hotel s design  physical condition and age  vii the estimated replacement cost and proposed acquisition price of the hotel  viii the price segment in which the hotel is operated  ix the reputation of the particular hotel management organization  if any  with which the hotel is or may become affiliated  x the level of services and amenities offered at the hotel  xi the proposed management agreement or lease terms  and xii the hotel brand under which the hotel operates or is expected to operate 
in determining the competitive position of a hotel  we examine the proximity of the hotel to business  retail  academic and tourist attractions and transportation routes  the number and characteristics of competitive hotels within the hotel s market area and the existence of barriers to entry within that market  including site availability and zoning restrictions 
while we have historically focused on the acquisition of upscale limited service  extended stay and full service hotel properties  we consider acquisitions in all segments of the hospitality industry 
an important part of our acquisition strategy is to identify and select qualified  experienced and financially stable hotel operators 
we have no policies which specifically limit the percentage of our assets which may be invested in any individual property  in any one type of property  in properties operated by or leased to any one entity or in properties operated by or leased to an affiliated group of entities 
in the past  we have considered the possibility of entering mergers or strategic combinations with other companies 
no such mergers or strategic combinations are under active negotiation at this time 
however  we may undertake such negotiations in the future 
a principal goal of any such transaction will be to diversify our revenue sources 
disposition policies in the past we have occasionally sold a hotel or exchanged hotels which we own for different hotels 
however  we have no current intention to dispose of any of our presently owned hotels  although we may do so 
we currently anticipate that disposition decisions  if any  will be based on factors including but not limited to the following i potential opportunities to increase revenues and property values by reinvesting sale proceeds  ii the proposed sale price  iii the strategic fit of the hotel with the rest of our portfolio  iv our operator s or tenant s desire to cease operation of the hotel  and v the existence of alternative sources  uses or needs for capital 
financing policies although there are no limitations in our organizational documents on the amount of indebtedness we may incur  our million unsecured revolving credit facility and our senior note indenture and its supplements contain financial covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain financial ratios and a minimum net worth 
we currently intend to pursue our growth strategies while maintaining debt less than of our total capitalization 
we may from time to time re evaluate and modify our financing policies in light of then current economic conditions  relative availability and costs of debt and equity capital  market values of properties  growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors  and we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to total capitalization accordingly 
our board of trustees may determine to obtain a replacement for our current credit facilities or to seek additional capital through equity offerings  debt financings  or retention of cash flows in excess of distributions to shareholders or a combination of these methods 
only one of our properties is encumbered by a mortgage 
to the extent that the board of trustees decides to obtain additional debt financing  we may do so on an unsecured basis or a secured basis 
we may seek to obtain other lines of credit or to issue securities senior to our common and or preferred shares  including preferred shares of beneficial interest and debt securities  either of which may be convertible into common shares or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common shares  or to engage in transactions which may involve a sale or other conveyance of hotels to subsidiaries or to unaffiliated entities 
we may finance acquisitions through an exchange of properties or through the issuance of additional common shares or other securities 
the proceeds from any of our financings may be used to pay distributions  to provide working capital  to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions and expansions of existing or new properties

competition 
the hotel industry is highly competitive 
generally our hotels are located in areas that include other hotels 
increases in the number of hotels in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy and daily room rates at our hotels located in that area 
agreements with the operators of our hotels restrict the right of each operator and its affiliates for limited periods of time to own  build  operate  franchise or manage other hotels of the same brand within various specified areas around our hotels 
under these agreements neither the operators nor their affiliates are restricted from operating other brands of hotels in the market areas of any of our hotels  and after such limited period of time  the operators and their affiliates may also compete with our hotels by opening  managing or franchising additional hotels under the same brand name in direct competition with our hotels 
we expect to compete for hotel acquisition and financing opportunities with entities which may have substantially greater financial resources than us  including  without limitation  other reits  hotel operating companies  banks  insurance companies  pension plans and public and private partnerships 
these entities may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage  including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of hotel operators 
such competition may reduce the number of suitable hotel acquisition or financing opportunities available to us or increase the bargaining power of hotel owners seeking to sell or finance their properties 
environmental matters 
under various laws  owners of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous substances present at a property  and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from such hazardous substances 
these laws also expose us to the possibility that we become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the hazardous substances 
we reviewed environmental surveys of the facilities we own prior to their purchase 
based upon those surveys we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination 
however  no assurances can be given that environmental conditions for which we would be liable are not present in our properties or that costs we incur to remediate contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

segment information 
we have one operating segment  hotel investments 
federal income tax considerations the following summary of federal income tax considerations is based on existing law  and is limited to investors who own our shares as investment assets rather than as inventory or as property used in a trade or business 
the summary does not discuss the particular tax consequences that might be relevant to you if you are subject to special rules under federal income tax law  for example if you are a bank  life insurance company  regulated investment company  or other financial institution  a broker or dealer in securities or foreign currency  a person who has a functional currency other than the us dollar  a person who acquires our shares in connection with employment or other performance of services  a person subject to alternative minimum tax  a person who owns our shares as part of a straddle  hedging transaction  constructive sale transaction  constructive ownership transaction  or conversion transaction  or except as specifically described in the following summary  a tax exempt entity or a foreign person 
the internal revenue code sections that govern federal income tax qualification and treatment of a reit and its shareholders are complex 
this presentation is a summary of applicable internal revenue code provisions  related rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations  all of which are subject to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
the american jobs creation act of  or the act  which president bush signed into law in october  made a number of significant changes to these provisions  some of which have retroactive effect  we have summarized these changes in more detail below 
future legislative  judicial  or administrative actions or decisions could also affect the accuracy of statements made in this summary 
we have not received a ruling from the irs with respect to any matter described in this summary  and we cannot assure you that the irs or a court will agree with the statements made in this summary 
in addition  this summary is not exhaustive of all possible tax consequences  and does not discuss any estate  gift  state  local  or foreign tax consequences 
for all these reasons  we urge you and any prospective acquiror of our shares to consult with a tax advisor about the federal income tax and other tax consequences of the acquisition  ownership and disposition of our shares 
our intentions and beliefs described in this summary are based upon our understanding of applicable laws and regulations which are in effect as of the date of this annual report on form k 
if new laws or regulations are enacted which impact us directly or indirectly  we may change our intentions or beliefs 
your federal income tax consequences may differ depending on whether or not you are a us shareholder 
for purposes of this summary  a us shareholder for federal income tax purposes is a citizen or resident of the united states  including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the united states or meets the substantial presence residency test under the federal income tax laws  an entity treated as a corporation or partnership for federal income tax purposes  that is created or organized in or under the laws of the united states  any state thereof or the district of columbia  unless otherwise provided by treasury regulations  an estate the income of which is subject to federal income taxation regardless of its source  or a trust if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more united states persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust  or electing trusts in existence on august   to the extent provided in treasury regulations  whose status as a us shareholder is not overridden by an applicable tax treaty 
conversely  a non us shareholder is a beneficial owner of our shares who is not a us shareholder 
taxation as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  our reit election  assuming continuing compliance with the then applicable qualification tests  continues in effect for subsequent taxable years 
although no assurance can be given  we believe that we are organized  have operated  and will continue to operate in a manner that qualifies us to be taxed under the internal revenue code as a reit 
as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income tax on our net income distributed as dividends to our shareholders 
distributions to our shareholders generally are included in their income as dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits 
our dividends are not generally entitled to the favorable rate on qualified dividend income  but a portion of our dividends may be treated as capital gain dividends  all as explained below 
no portion of any of our dividends is eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders 
distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits generally are treated for federal income tax purposes as return of capital to the extent of a recipient shareholder s basis in our shares  and will reduce this basis 
our current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally allocated first to distributions made on our preferred shares  and thereafter to distributions made on our common shares 
our counsel  sullivan worcester llp  has opined that we have been organized and have qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code for our through taxable years  and that our current investments and plan of operation enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
our continued qualification and taxation as a reit will depend upon our compliance with various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code and summarized below 
while we believe that we will satisfy these tests  our counsel has not reviewed and will not review compliance with these tests on a continuing basis 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will be subject to federal income taxation as if we were a c corporation and our shareholders will be taxed like shareholders of c corporations 
in this event  we could be subject to significant tax liabilities  and the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders may be reduced or eliminated 
if we qualify as a reit and meet the tests described below  we generally will not pay federal income tax on amounts we distribute to our shareholders 
however  even if we qualify as a reit  we may be subject to federal tax in the following circumstances we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed real estate investment trust taxable income  including our undistributed net capital gains 
if our alternative minimum taxable income exceeds our taxable income  we may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference 
if we have net income from the disposition of foreclosure property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property  we will be subject to tax on this income at the highest regular corporate rate  currently 
if we have net income from prohibited transactions  including dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than foreclosure property  we will be subject to tax on this income at a rate 
if we fail to satisfy the gross income test or the gross income test discussed below  but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit  we will be subject to tax at a rate on the greater of the amount by which we fail the or the test  with adjustments  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
if we fail to distribute for any calendar year at least the sum of of our reit ordinary income for that year  of our reit capital gain net income for that year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods  we will be subject to a excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
if we acquire an asset from a corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a present or former c corporation  and if we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of this asset during the ten year period beginning on the date on which the asset ceased to be owned by the c corporation  then we will pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate  which is currently  on the lesser of the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the c corporation s basis in the asset on the date the asset ceased to be owned by the c corporation  or the gain we recognize in the disposition 
if we acquire a corporation  to preserve our status as a reit we must generally distribute all of the c corporation earnings and profits inherited in that acquisition  if any  not later than the end of the taxable year of the acquisition 
however  if we fail to do so  relief provisions would allow us to maintain our status as a reit provided we distribute any subsequently discovered c corporation earnings and profits and pay an interest charge in respect of the period of delayed distribution 
as summarized below  reits are permitted within limits to own stock and securities of a taxable reit subsidiary 
a taxable reit subsidiary is separately taxed on its net income as a c corporation  and is subject to limitations on the deductibility of interest expense paid to its reit parent 
in addition  its reit parent is subject to a tax on the difference between amounts charged and redetermined rents and deductions  including excess interest 
if and to the extent we invest in properties in foreign jurisdictions  our income from those properties will generally be subject to tax in those jurisdictions 
as noted above  we acquired twelve hotels on february  two of these hotels are in canada and one is in puerto rico 
our profits from these investments outside of the united states will generally be subject to tax in canada and puerto rico  respectively 
through structuring and obtaining available tax exemptions  we expect to minimize the canadian and puerto rican income taxes we have to pay  but there can be no assurance that we will succeed in doing so 
if we continue to operate as we do  then we will distribute our taxable income to our shareholders each year and we will generally not pay federal income tax 
as a result  we cannot recover the cost of foreign income taxes imposed on our foreign investments by claiming foreign tax credits against our federal income tax liability 
also  we cannot pass through to our shareholders any foreign tax credits 
if we fail to qualify or elect not to qualify as a reit  we will be subject to federal income tax in the same manner as a c corporation 
distributions to our shareholders if we do not qualify as a reit will not be deductible by us nor will distributions be required under the internal revenue code 
in that event  distributions to our shareholders will generally be taxable as ordinary dividends potentially eligible for the income tax rate discussed below in taxation of us shareholders and  subject to limitations in the internal revenue code  will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders 
also  we will generally be disqualified from qualification as a reit for the four taxable years following disqualification 
if we do not qualify as a reit for even one year  this could result in reduction or elimination of distributions to our shareholders  or in our incurring substantial indebtedness or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting corporate level taxes 
for our taxable year and beyond  the act provides certain relief provision under which we might avoid automatically ceasing to be a reit for failure to meet certain reit requirements  all as discussed in more detail below 
reit qualification requirements general requirements 
section a of the internal revenue code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association that is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  that would be taxable  but for sections through of the internal revenue code  as a c corporation  that is not a financial institution or an insurance company subject to special provisions of the internal revenue code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  that is not closely held as defined under the personal holding company stock ownership test  as described below  and that meets other tests regarding income  assets and distributions  all as described below 
section b of the internal revenue code provides that conditions through must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of months  or during a pro rata part of a taxable year of less than months 
section h of the internal revenue code provides that neither condition nor need be met for our first taxable year as a reit 
we believe that we have met conditions through during each of the requisite periods ending on or before december   and that we can continue to meet these conditions in future taxable years 
there can  however  be no assurance in this regard 
by reason of condition  we will fail to qualify as a reit for a taxable year if at any time during the last half of a year more than in value of our outstanding shares is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals 
to help comply with condition  our declaration of trust restricts transfers of our shares 
in addition  if we comply with applicable treasury regulations to ascertain the ownership of our shares and do not know  or by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known  that we failed condition  then we will be treated as having met condition 
however  our failure to comply with these regulations for ascertaining ownership may result in a penalty of  or  for intentional violations 
accordingly  we intend to comply with these regulations  and to request annually from record holders of significant percentages of our shares information regarding the ownership of our shares 
under our declaration of trust  our shareholders are required to respond to these requests for information 
for purposes of condition  reit shares held by a pension trust are treated as held directly by the pension trust s beneficiaries in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust 
consequently  five or fewer pension trusts could own more than of the interests in an entity without jeopardizing that entity s federal income tax qualification as a reit 
however  as discussed below  if a reit is a pension held reit  each pension trust owning more than of the reit s shares by value generally may be taxed on a portion of the dividends it receives from the reit 
the act provides that  for our taxable year and beyond  we will not automatically fail to be a reit if we do not meet conditions through  provided we can establish reasonable cause for any such failure 
each such excused failure will result in the imposition of a  penalty instead of reit disqualification 
it is impossible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of this relief provision 
our wholly owned subsidiaries and our investments through partnerships 
except in respect of taxable reit subsidiaries as discussed below  section i of the internal revenue code provides that any corporation  of whose stock is held by a reit  is a qualified reit subsidiary and shall not be treated as a separate corporation 
the assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary are treated as the reit s 
we believe that each of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  other than the taxable reit subsidiaries discussed below  will either be a qualified reit subsidiary within the meaning of section i of the internal revenue code  or a noncorporate entity that for federal income tax purposes is not treated as separate from its owner under regulations issued under section of the internal revenue code 
thus  except for the taxable reit subsidiaries discussed below  in applying all the federal income tax reit qualification requirements described in this summary  all assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction and credit of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries are treated as ours 
we have invested and may invest in real estate through one or more limited or general partnerships or limited liability companies that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes 
in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership  regulations under the internal revenue code provide that  for purposes of the reit qualification requirements regarding income and assets discussed below  the reit is deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership corresponding to the reit s proportionate capital interest in the partnership and is deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to this proportionate share 
in addition  for these purposes  the character of the assets and gross income of the partnership generally retain the same character in the hands of the reit 
accordingly  our proportionate share of the assets  liabilities  and items of income of each partnership in which we are a partner is treated as ours for purposes of the income tests and asset tests discussed below 
in contrast  for purposes of the distribution requirement discussed below  we must take into account as a partner our share of the partnership s income as determined under the general federal income tax rules governing partners and partnerships under sections through of the internal revenue code 
taxable reit subsidiaries 
we are permitted to own any or all of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary as defined in section l of the internal revenue code  provided that no more than of our assets  at the close of each quarter  is comprised of our investments in the stock or securities of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
among other requirements  a taxable reit subsidiary must be a non reit corporation for federal income tax purposes in which we directly or indirectly own shares  join with us in making a taxable reit subsidiary election  not directly or indirectly operate or manage a lodging facility or a health care facility  and not directly or indirectly provide to any person  under a franchise  license  or otherwise  rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated  except that in limited circumstances a subfranchise  sublicense or similar right can be granted to an independent contractor to operate or manage a lodging facility 
in addition  a corporation other than a reit in which a taxable reit subsidiary directly or indirectly owns more than of the voting power or value will automatically be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary 
subject to the discussion below  we believe that we and each of our taxable reit subsidiaries have complied with  and will continue to comply with  the requirements for taxable reit subsidiary status during all times each subsidiary s taxable reit subsidiary election remains in effect  and we believe that the same will be true for any taxable reit subsidiary that we later form or acquire 
our ownership of stock and securities in taxable reit subsidiaries is exempt from the and reit asset tests discussed below 
also  as discussed below  taxable reit subsidiaries can perform services for our tenants without disqualifying the rents we receive from those tenants under the or gross income tests discussed below 
moreover  because taxable reit subsidiaries are taxed as c corporations that are separate from us  their assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction and credit are not generally imputed to us for purposes of the reit qualification requirements described in this summary 
therefore  taxable reit subsidiaries can generally undertake third party management and development activities and activities not related to real estate 
finally  while a reit is generally limited in its ability to earn qualifying rental income from a taxable reit subsidiary  a reit can earn qualifying rental income from the lease of a qualified lodging facility to a taxable reit subsidiary if an eligible independent contractor operates the facility  as discussed more fully below 
restrictions are imposed on taxable reit subsidiaries to ensure that they will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary may not deduct interest paid in any year to an affiliated reit to the extent that the interest payments exceed  generally  of the taxable reit subsidiary s adjusted taxable income for that year 
however  the taxable reit subsidiary may carry forward the disallowed interest expense to a succeeding year  and deduct the interest in that later year subject to that year s adjusted taxable income limitation 
in addition  if a taxable reit subsidiary pays interest  rent  or other amounts to its affiliated reit in an amount that exceeds what an unrelated third party would have paid in an arm s length transaction  then the reit generally will be subject to an excise tax equal to of the excessive portion of the payment 
finally  if in comparison to an arm s length transaction  a tenant has overpaid rent to the reit in exchange for underpaying the taxable reit subsidiary for services rendered  then the reit may be subject to an excise tax equal to of the overpayment 
there can be no assurance that arrangements involving our taxable reit subsidiaries will not result in the imposition of one or more of these deduction limitations or excise taxes  but we do not believe that we are or will be subject to these impositions 
income tests 
there are two gross income requirements for qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code at least of our gross income  excluding gross income from sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale  must be derived from investments relating to real property  including rents from real property as defined under section of the internal revenue code  mortgages on real property  or shares in other reits 
when we receive new capital in exchange for our shares or in a public offering of five year or longer debt instruments  income attributable to the temporary investment of this new capital in stock or a debt instrument  if received or accrued within one year of our receipt of the new capital  is generally also qualifying income under the test 
at least of our gross income  excluding gross income from sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale  must be derived from a combination of items of real property income that satisfy the test described above  dividends  interest  gains from the sale or disposition of stock  securities  or real property or  for our and earlier taxable years  certain payments under interest rate swap or cap agreements  options  futures contracts  forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments 
the income test has been modified for our taxable years beginning after so that gross income  except as may be provided in treasury regulations  no longer includes income from a hedging transaction as defined under clauses ii and iii of section b a of the internal revenue code  but only to the extent that the transaction hedges indebtedness we incur to acquire or carry real estate assets 
this modification to the income test only applies to hedging transactions that are clearly identified  meaning that the transaction must be identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered and the risks being hedged must be identified generally within days after the date the transaction is entered 
for purposes of the and gross income tests outlined above  income derived from a shared appreciation provision in a mortgage loan is generally treated as gain recognized on the sale of the property to which it relates 
although we will use our best efforts to ensure that the income generated by our investments will be of a type which satisfies both the and gross income tests  there can be no assurance in this regard 
in order to qualify as rents from real property under section of the internal revenue code  several requirements must be met the amount of rent received generally must not be based on the income or profits of any person  but may be based on receipts or sales 
rents do not qualify if the reit owns or more by vote or value of the tenant  whether directly or after application of attribution rules 
while we intend not to lease property to any party if rents from that property would not qualify as rents from real property  application of the ownership rule is dependent upon complex attribution rules and circumstances that may be beyond our control 
for example  an unaffiliated third party s ownership directly or by attribution of or more by value of our shares  as well as or more by vote or value of the stock of one of our tenants  would result in that tenant s rents not qualifying as rents from real property 
our declaration of trust disallows transfers or purported acquisitions  directly or by attribution  of our shares to the extent necessary to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that these provisions in our declaration of trust will be effective to prevent our reit status from being jeopardized under the affiliated tenant rule 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce these restrictions  nor will our shareholders necessarily be aware of ownership of shares attributed to them under the internal revenue code s attribution rules 
there is a limited exception to the above prohibition on earning rents from real property from a affiliated tenant  if the tenant is a taxable reit subsidiary 
if at least of the leased space of a property is leased to tenants other than taxable reit subsidiaries and affiliated tenants  and if the taxable reit subsidiary s rent for space at that property is substantially comparable to the rents paid by nonaffiliated tenants for comparable space at the property  then otherwise qualifying rents paid by the taxable reit subsidiary to the reit will not be disqualified on account of the rule prohibiting affiliated tenants 
there is a second exception to the above prohibition on earning rents from real property from a affiliated tenant 
for this second exception to apply  a real property interest in a qualified lodging facility must be leased by the reit to its taxable reit subsidiary  and the facility must be operated on behalf of the taxable reit subsidiary by a person who is an eligible independent contractor  all as described in section d of the internal revenue code 
as described below  we believe our leases with our taxable reit subsidiaries have satisfied and will satisfy these requirements 
in order for rents to qualify  we generally must not manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of the property  except through an independent contractor from whom we derive no income or  for our taxable year and thereafter  through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
there is an exception to this rule permitting a reit to perform customary tenant services of the sort which a tax exempt organization could perform without being considered in receipt of unrelated business taxable income as defined in section b of the internal revenue code 
in addition  a de minimis amount of noncustomary services will not disqualify income as rents from real property so long as the value of the impermissible services does not exceed of the gross income from the property 
if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is or less of the total rent received under the lease  then the rent attributable to personal property will qualify as rents from real property  if this threshold is exceeded  the rent attributable to personal property will not so qualify 
for our taxable years through december   the portion of rental income treated as attributable to personal property was determined according to the ratio of the tax basis of the personal property to the total tax basis of the real and personal property which is rented 
for our taxable year and thereafter  the ratio is determined by reference to fair market values rather than tax bases 
we believe that all or substantially all our rents have qualified and will qualify as rents from real property for purposes of section of the internal revenue code 
in order to qualify as mortgage interest on real property for purposes of the test  interest must derive from a mortgage loan secured by real property with a fair market value  at the time the loan is made  at least equal to the amount of the loan 
if the amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property  the interest will be treated as interest on a mortgage loan in a ratio equal to the ratio of the fair market value of the real property to the total amount of the mortgage loan 
amounts payable to us under agreements relating to the canadian hotels we acquired on february  may be determined by reference to canadian dollar expenditures or revenues 
currency translation or exchange gains or losses might not count favorably toward the and gross income tests summarized above  and thus  in sufficient amounts  such currency gains could threaten compliance with the reit income tests 
however  because any amounts paid to us  as opposed to our taxable reit subsidiary  under these canadian hotel agreements will be in us dollars only  we do not expect to have material amounts of currency gains in respect of our canadian investments 
other than sales of foreclosure property  any gain we realize on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a penalty tax at a rate 
this prohibited transaction income also may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the and gross income tests for federal income tax qualification as a reit 
we cannot provide assurances as to whether or not the irs might successfully assert that one or more of our dispositions is subject to the penalty tax 
however  we believe that dispositions of assets that we have made or that we might make in the future will not be subject to the penalty tax  because we intend to own our assets for investment with a view to long term income production and capital appreciation  engage in the business of developing  owning and operating our existing properties and acquiring  developing  owning and operating new properties  and make occasional dispositions of our assets consistent with our long term investment objectives 
for our and prior taxable years  if we failed to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for that year if our failure to meet the test was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we report the nature and amount of each item of our income included in the or gross income tests for that taxable year on a schedule attached to our tax return  and any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
we have in the past attached and for our taxable year will continue to attach a schedule of gross income to our federal income tax returns  but it is impossible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of this relief provision for the and gross income tests 
even if this relief provision did apply  a tax is imposed upon the greater of the amount by which we failed the test or the test  with adjustments  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
the act has modified this relief provision for failures to satisfy either or both of the or the gross income tests in the case of failures for our taxable year or later 
specifically  if we fail to satisfy either or both of the gross income tests for a taxable year after  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for that year if our failure to meet the test is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and  after we identify the failure  we file a schedule describing each item of our gross income included in the or gross income tests for that taxable year 
it is impossible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of this revised relief provision for the and gross income tests 
even if this relief provision did apply  a tax is imposed upon the greater of the amount by which we failed the test or the test  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
asset tests 
at the close of each quarter of each taxable year  we must also satisfy the following asset percentage tests in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes at least of our total assets must consist of real estate assets  cash and cash items  shares in other reits  government securities  and stock or debt instruments purchased with proceeds of a stock offering or an offering of our debt with a term of at least five years  but only for the one year period commencing with our receipt of the offering proceeds 
not more than of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those securities that count favorably toward the preceding asset test 
of the investments included in the preceding asset class  the value of any one non reit issuer s securities that we own may not exceed of the value of our total assets  and we may not own more than of any one non reit issuer s outstanding voting securities 
for our taxable year and thereafter  we may not own more than of the vote or value of any one non reit issuer s outstanding securities  unless that issuer is our taxable reit subsidiary or the securities are straight debt securities or otherwise excepted as discussed below 
for our taxable year and thereafter  our stock and securities in a taxable reit subsidiary are exempted from the preceding and asset tests 
however  no more than of our total assets may be represented by stock or securities of taxable reit subsidiaries 
when a failure to satisfy the above asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
in addition  for our taxable year and thereafter  the act provides that if we fail the value test or the vote or value tests at the close of any quarter and do not cure such failure within days after the close of that quarter  that failure will nevertheless be excused if a the failure is de minimis and b within months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify the failure  we either dispose of the assets causing the failure or otherwise satisfy the value and vote and value asset tests 
for purposes of this relief provision  the failure will be de minimis if the value of the assets causing the failure does not exceed the lesser of a of the total value of our assets at the end of the relevant quarter or b  if our failure is not de minimis  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit if a we provide the irs with a description of each asset causing the failure  b the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect  c we pay a tax equal to the greater of i  or ii the highest rate of corporate tax imposed currently on the net income generated by the assets causing the failure during the period of the failure  and d within months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify the failure  we either dispose of the assets causing the failure or otherwise satisfy the value and vote and value asset tests 
the act clarifies and expands  on a retroactive basis so as to be effective for our taxable year forward  an excepted securities safe harbor to the value test that includes among other items a straight debt securities  b certain rental agreements in which payment is to be made in subsequent years  c any obligation to pay rents from real property  d securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of or payments from a nongovernmental entity  and e any security issued by another reit 
we intend to maintain records of the value of our assets to document our compliance with the above asset tests  and to take actions as may be required to cure any failure to satisfy the tests within days after the close of any quarter 
our relationship with our taxable reit subsidiaries 
we currently own hotels that we purchased to be leased to our taxable reit subsidiaries or which are being leased to our taxable reit subsidiaries as a result of modifications to a prior lease that were agreed to among us  the former tenant and the manager 
we may from time to time in the future lease additional hotels which we acquire in this manner 
in connection with lease defaults  we terminated occupancy of some of our hotels by defaulting tenants and immediately leased these hotels to our taxable reit subsidiaries and entered into new third party management agreements for these hotels 
we may in the future employ similar arrangements if we ever again face lease or occupancy terminations 
in transactions involving our taxable reit subsidiaries  our intent is that the rents paid to us by the taxable reit subsidiary qualify as rents from real property under the reit gross income tests summarized above 
in order for this to be the case  the manager engaged by the applicable taxable reit subsidiary must be an eligible independent contractor within the meaning of section d a of the internal revenue code  and the hotels leased to the taxable reit subsidiary must be qualified lodging facilities within the meaning of section d d of the internal revenue code 
qualified lodging facilities are defined as hotels  motels  or other establishments where more than half of the dwelling units are used on a transient basis  provided that legally authorized wagering or gambling activities are not conducted at or in connection with such facilities 
also included in the definition are the qualified lodging facility s customary amenities and facilities 
for these purposes  a contractor qualifies as an eligible independent contractor if it is less than affiliated with the reit and  at the time the contractor enters into the agreement with the taxable reit subsidiary to operate the qualified lodging facility  that contractor or any person related to that contractor is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities for persons unrelated to the taxable reit subsidiary or its affiliated reit 
for these purposes  an otherwise eligible independent contractor is not disqualified from that status on account of the taxable reit subsidiary bearing the expenses for the operation of the qualified lodging facility  the taxable reit subsidiary receiving the revenues from the operation of the qualified lodging facility  net of expenses for that operation and fees payable to the eligible independent contractor  or the reit receiving income from the eligible independent contractor pursuant to a preexisting or otherwise grandfathered lease of another property 
in one case involving a manager whose hotel management activities for parties unrelated to us was not as extensive as those of our other managers  we received an opinion of counsel that the particular manager should qualify as an eligible independent contractor within the meaning of section d a of the internal revenue code  and that  although the matter is not free from doubt  it is reasonable for us to rely on such opinion for purposes of the relief provisions under the reit gross income tests summarized above 
accordingly  although there can be no assurance in this regard  we expect that the rental income we receive from our taxable reit subsidiaries will qualify as rents from real property under the reit gross income tests 
we also took steps to qualify for the and gross income tests relief provision  including for example attaching an applicable schedule of gross income to our federal income tax returns as previously required by section c of the internal revenue code 
thus  even if the irs or a court ultimately determines that one or more of our managers failed to operate qualified lodging facilities for others sufficient to qualify as an eligible independent contractor  and that this failure thereby implicated our compliance with the reit gross income tests  we expect we would qualify for the gross income tests relief provision and thereby preserve our qualification as a reit 
as explained above  we will be subject to a tax if the irs successfully asserts that the rents paid by our taxable reit subsidiary to us exceed an arm s length rental rate 
although there is no clear precedent to distinguish for federal income tax purposes among leases  management contracts  partnerships  financings  and other contractual arrangements  we believe that our leases and our taxable reit subsidiaries management agreements will be respected for purposes of the requirements of the internal revenue code discussed above 
accordingly  we expect that the rental income from our current and future taxable reit subsidiaries will qualify favorably as rents from real property  and that the tax on excessive rents from a taxable reit subsidiary will not apply 
annual distribution requirements 
in order to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code  we are required to make annual distributions other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to the excess of a the sum of of our real estate investment trust taxable income  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  computed by excluding any net capital gain and before taking into account any dividends paid deduction for which we are eligible  and of our net income after tax  if any  from property received in foreclosure  over b the sum of our qualifying noncash income  eg  imputed rental income or income from transactions inadvertently failing to qualify as like kind exchanges 
the distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the earlier taxable year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after that declaration 
if a dividend is declared in october  november  or december to shareholders of record during one of those months  and is paid during the following january  then for federal income tax purposes the dividend will be treated as having been both paid and received on december of the prior taxable year 
a distribution which is not pro rata within a class of our beneficial interests entitled to a distribution  or which is not consistent with the rights to distributions among our classes of beneficial interests  is a preferential distribution that is not taken into consideration for purposes of the distribution requirements  and accordingly the payment of a preferential distribution could affect our ability to meet the distribution requirements 
taking into account our distribution policies  including the dividend reinvestment plan we have adopted  we expect that we will not make any preferential distributions 
the distribution requirements may be waived by the irs if a reit establishes that it failed to meet them by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of the excise tax discussed below 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain and all of our real estate investment trust taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax on undistributed amounts 
in addition  we will be subject to a excise tax to the extent we fail within a calendar year to make required distributions to our shareholders of of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income plus the excess  if any  of the grossed up required distribution for the preceding calendar year over the amount treated as distributed for that preceding calendar year 
for this purpose  the term grossed up required distribution for any calendar year is the sum of our taxable income for the calendar year without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and all amounts from earlier years that are not treated as having been distributed under the provision 
we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution by us up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the excise tax 
distributions we made to our shareholders during were insufficient to meet the distribution requirement and to fully distribute all of our real estate investment trust taxable income  even after taking into account our distribution to our common shareholders on january  that was treated for all tax purposes as made in under the rules discussed above 
we therefore elected to apply one or more of our regular  periodic distributions toward our distribution requirements and toward full distribution of our real estate investment trust taxable income 
distributions we made to our shareholders during were sufficient to meet the distribution requirement but insufficient to fully distribute all of our real estate investment trust taxable income  even after taking into account our distribution to our common shareholders on january  that was treated for all tax purposes as made in under the rules discussed above 
we therefore intend to elect to apply one or more of our regular  periodic distributions toward full distribution of our real estate investment trust taxable income  all in the manner described above 
these clawbacks of and distributions  other than the january and january common distributions  do not relate back to our or taxable years  respectively  for purposes of the excise tax  nonetheless  we owed no excise tax in respect of these taxable years 
if we do not have enough cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements  we may find it necessary and desirable to arrange for new debt or equity financing to provide funds for required distributions in order to maintain our reit status 
we can provide no assurance that financing would be available for these purposes on favorable terms 
we may be able to rectify a failure to pay sufficient dividends for any year by paying deficiency dividends to shareholders in a later year 
these deficiency dividends may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year  but an interest charge would be imposed upon us for the delay in distribution 
although we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends  we will remain liable for the excise tax discussed above 
in addition to the other distribution requirements above  to preserve our status as a reit we are required to timely distribute c corporation earnings and profits that we inherit from acquired corporations 
acquisition of hotels and c corporation 
as discussed above  on february   we purchased hotels 
nine of these hotels are located in the united states  two are located in canada  and one is in puerto rico 
in order to acquire the hotel in puerto rico  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of a c corporation that owned that hotel as its primary asset 
upon our acquisition  the acquired c corporation became our qualified reit subsidiary under section i of the internal revenue code 
thus  after the acquisition  all assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction and credit of the acquired corporation are treated as ours for purposes of the various reit qualification tests described above 
in a stock acquisition  we are generally treated as the successor to the acquired corporation s federal income tax attributes  such as its adjusted tax bases in its assets and its c corporation earnings and profits 
however  because we made an election under section g of the internal revenue code in respect of this acquired corporation  we did not succeed to its earnings and profits  nor do we have any built in gain in the former c corporation s assets 
depreciation and federal income tax treatment of leases our initial tax bases in our assets will generally be our acquisition cost 
we will generally depreciate our real property on a straight line basis over years and our personal property over years 
these depreciation schedules may vary for properties that we acquire through tax free or carryover basis acquisitions 
we are entitled to depreciation deductions from our facilities only if we are treated for federal income tax purposes as the owner of the facilities 
this means that the leases of the facilities must be classified for federal income tax purposes as true leases  rather than as sales or financing arrangements  and we believe this to be the case 
in the case of sale leaseback arrangements  the irs could assert that we realized prepaid rental income in the year of purchase to the extent that the value of a leased property  at the time of purchase  exceeded the purchase price for that property 
while we believe that the value of leased property at the time of purchase did not exceed purchase prices  because of the lack of clear precedent we cannot provide assurances as to whether the irs might successfully assert the existence of prepaid rental income in any of our sale leaseback transactions 
taxation of us shareholders the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of reduced the maximum individual federal income tax rate for long term capital gains generally to for gains properly taken into account during the period beginning may   and ending for taxable years that begin after december  and for most corporate dividends generally to for taxable years that begin in the years through 
however  because we are not generally subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our shareholders  dividends on our shares generally are not eligible for the new tax rate on dividends 
as a result  our ordinary dividends continue to be taxed at the higher federal income tax rates applicable to ordinary income 
however  the federal income tax rate for long term capital gains and dividends generally applies to your long term capital gains  if any  recognized on the disposition of our shares  our distributions designated as long term capital gain dividends except to the extent attributable to real estate depreciation recapture  in which case the distributions are subject to a federal income tax rate  our dividends attributable to dividends  if any  received by us from non reit corporations such as taxable reit subsidiaries  and our dividends to the extent attributable to income upon which we have paid federal corporate income tax 
as long as we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  a distribution to our us shareholders that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend will be treated as an ordinary income dividend to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits 
distributions made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long term capital gains  as discussed below  to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year 
however  corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to of any capital gain dividend as ordinary income under section of the internal revenue code 
in addition  we may elect to retain net capital gain income and treat it as constructively distributed 
in that case we will be taxed at regular corporate capital gains tax rates on retained amounts  each us shareholder will be taxed on its designated proportionate share of our retained net capital gains as though that amount were distributed and designated a capital gain dividend  each us shareholder will receive a credit for its designated proportionate share of the tax that we pay  each us shareholder will increase its adjusted basis in our shares by the excess of the amount of its proportionate share of these retained net capital gains over its proportionate share of this tax that we pay  and both we and our corporate shareholders will make commensurate adjustments in our respective earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes 
if we elect to retain our net capital gains in this fashion  we will notify our us shareholders of the relevant tax information within days after the close of the affected taxable year 
as discussed above  for noncorporate us shareholders  long term capital gains are generally taxed at maximum rates of or  depending upon the type of property disposed of and the previously claimed depreciation with respect to this property 
if for any taxable year we designate capital gain dividends for us shareholders  then the portion of the capital gain dividends we designate will be allocated to the holders of a particular class of shares on a percentage basis equal to the ratio of the amount of the total dividends paid or made available for the year to the holders of that class of shares to the total dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of our shares 
we will similarly designate the portion of any capital gain dividend that is to be taxed to noncorporate us shareholders at the maximum rates of or so that the designations will be proportionate among all classes of our shares 
distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a us shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the shareholder s adjusted tax basis in the shareholder s shares  but will reduce the shareholder s basis in those shares 
to the extent that these excess distributions exceed the adjusted basis of a us shareholder s shares  they will be included in income as capital gain  with long term gain generally taxed to noncorporate us shareholders at a maximum rate of 
no us shareholder may include on his federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or any of our capital losses 
dividends that we declare in october  november or december of a taxable year to us shareholders of record on a date in those months will be deemed to have been received by shareholders on december of that taxable year  provided we actually pay these dividends during the following january 
also  items that are treated differently for regular and alternative minimum tax purposes are to be allocated between a reit and its shareholders under treasury regulations which are to be prescribed 
it is possible that these treasury regulations will require tax preference items to be allocated to our shareholders with respect to any accelerated depreciation or other tax preference items that we claim 
a us shareholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder s adjusted basis in our shares which are sold or exchanged 
this gain or loss will be capital gain or loss  and will be long term capital gain or loss if the shareholder s holding period in the shares exceeds one year 
in addition  any loss upon a sale or exchange of our shares held for six months or less will generally be treated as a long term capital loss to the extent of our long term capital gain dividends during the holding period 
the act imposes a penalty  effective for federal tax returns with due dates after october   for the failure to properly disclose a reportable transaction 
a reportable transaction currently includes  among other things  a sale or exchange of our shares resulting in a tax loss in excess of i million in any single year or million in any combination of years in the case of our shares held by a c corporation or by a partnership with only c corporation partners or ii million in any single year or million in any combination of years in the case of our shares held by any other partnership or an s corporation  trust or individual  including losses that flow through pass through entities to individuals 
a taxpayer discloses a reportable transaction by filing irs form with its federal income tax return and  in the first year of filing  a copy of form must be sent to the irs s office of tax shelter analysis 
the penalty for failing to disclose a reportable transaction is generally  in the case of a natural person and  in any other case 
noncorporate us shareholders who borrow funds to finance their acquisition of our shares could be limited in the amount of deductions allowed for the interest paid on the indebtedness incurred 
under section d of the internal revenue code  interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry property held for investment is generally deductible only to the extent of the investor s net investment income 
a us shareholder s net investment income will include ordinary income dividend distributions received from us and  if an appropriate election is made by the shareholder  capital gain dividend distributions received from us  however  distributions treated as a nontaxable return of the shareholder s basis will not enter into the computation of net investment income 
taxation of tax exempt shareholders in revenue ruling  the irs ruled that amounts distributed by a reit to a tax exempt employees pension trust did not constitute unrelated business taxable income  even though the reit may have financed some of its activities with acquisition indebtedness 
although revenue rulings are interpretive in nature and subject to revocation or modification by the irs  based upon the analysis and conclusion of revenue ruling  our distributions made to shareholders that are tax exempt pension plans  individual retirement accounts  or other qualifying tax exempt entities should not constitute unrelated business taxable income  unless the shareholder has financed its acquisition of our shares with acquisition indebtedness within the meaning of the internal revenue code 
tax exempt pension trusts  including so called k plans but excluding individual retirement accounts or government pension plans  that own more than by value of a pension held reit at any time during a taxable year may be required to treat a percentage of all dividends received from the pension held reit during the year as unrelated business taxable income 
this percentage is equal to the ratio of the pension held reit s gross income derived from the conduct of unrelated trades or businesses  determined as if the pension held reit were a tax exempt pension fund  less direct expenses related to that income  to the pension held reit s gross income from all sources  less direct expenses related to that income  except that this percentage shall be deemed to be zero unless it would otherwise equal or exceed 
a reit is a pension held reit if the reit is predominantly held by tax exempt pension trusts  and the reit would fail to satisfy the closely held ownership requirement discussed above if the stock or beneficial interests in the reit held by tax exempt pension trusts were viewed as held by tax exempt pension trusts rather than by their respective beneficiaries 
a reit is predominantly held by tax exempt pension trusts if at least one tax exempt pension trust owns more than by value of the reit s stock or beneficial interests  or if one or more tax exempt pension trusts  each owning more than by value of the reit s stock or beneficial interests  own in the aggregate more than by value of the reit s stock or beneficial interests 
because of the share ownership concentration restrictions in our declaration of trust  we believe that we are not and will not be a pension held reit 
however  because our shares are publicly traded  we cannot completely control whether or not we are or will become a pension held reit 
social clubs  voluntary employee benefit associations  supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under sections c  c  c and c of the internal revenue code  respectively  are subject to different unrelated business taxable income rules  which generally will require them to characterize distributions from a reit as unrelated business taxable income 
in addition  these prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning any set aside or reserve requirements applicable to them 
taxation of non us shareholders the rules governing the united states federal income taxation of non us shareholders are complex  and the following discussion is intended only as a summary of these rules 
if you are a non us shareholder  we urge you to consult with your own tax advisor to determine the impact of united states federal  state  local  and foreign tax laws  including any tax return filing and other reporting requirements  with respect to your investment in our shares 
in general  a non us shareholder will be subject to regular united states federal income tax in the same manner as a us shareholder with respect to its investment in our shares if that investment is effectively connected with the non us shareholder s conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
in addition  a corporate non us shareholder that receives income that is or is deemed effectively connected with a trade or business in the united states may also be subject to the branch profits tax under section of the internal revenue code  which is payable in addition to regular united states federal corporate income tax 
the balance of this discussion of the united states federal income taxation of non us shareholders addresses only those non us shareholders whose investment in our shares is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
a distribution by us to a non us shareholder that is not attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest and that is not designated as a capital gain dividend will be treated as an ordinary income dividend to the extent that it is made out of current or accumulated earnings and profits 
a distribution of this type will generally be subject to united states federal income tax and withholding at the rate of  or at a lower rate if the non us shareholder has in the manner prescribed by the irs demonstrated its entitlement to benefits under a tax treaty 
because we cannot determine our current and accumulated earnings and profits until the end of the taxable year  withholding at the rate of or applicable lower treaty rate will generally be imposed on the gross amount of any distribution to a non us shareholder that we make and do not designate a capital gain dividend 
notwithstanding this withholding on distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  these distributions are a nontaxable return of capital to the extent that they do not exceed the non us shareholder s adjusted basis in our shares  and the nontaxable return of capital will reduce the adjusted basis in these shares 
to the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the non us shareholder s adjusted basis in our shares  the distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non us shareholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or exchange of these shares  as discussed below 
a non us shareholder may seek a refund from the irs of amounts withheld on distributions to him in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
except as discussed below with respect to certain capital gains dividends in taxable years after  for any year in which we qualify as a reit  distributions that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest are taxed to a non us shareholder as if these distributions were gains effectively connected with a trade or business in the united states conducted by the non us shareholder 
accordingly  a non us shareholder will be taxed on these amounts at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us shareholder  subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals  the non us shareholder will be required to file a united states federal income tax return reporting these amounts  even if applicable withholding is imposed as described below  and corporate non us shareholders may owe the branch profits tax under section of the internal revenue code in respect of these amounts 
we will be required to withhold from distributions to non us shareholders  and remit to the irs  of the maximum amount of any distribution that could be designated as a capital gain dividend 
in addition  for purposes of this withholding rule  if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends  then subsequent distributions up to the amount of the designated prior distributions will be treated as capital gain dividends 
the amount of any tax withheld is creditable against the non us shareholder s united states federal income tax liability  and the non us shareholder may file for a refund from the irs of any amount of withheld tax in excess of that tax liability 
if for any taxable year we designate capital gain dividends for our shareholders  then the portion of the capital gain dividends we designate will be allocated to the holders of a particular class of shares on a percentage basis equal to the ratio of the amount of the total dividends paid or made available for the year to the holders of that class of shares to the total dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of our shares 
tax treaties may reduce the withholding obligations on our distributions 
under some treaties  however  rates below that are applicable to ordinary income dividends from united states corporations may not apply to ordinary income dividends from a reit 
you must generally use an applicable irs form w  or substantially similar form  to claim tax treaty benefits 
if the amount of tax withheld by us with respect to a distribution to a non us shareholder exceeds the shareholder s united states federal income tax liability with respect to the distribution  the non us shareholder may file for a refund of the excess from the irs 
the withholding tax rate on capital gain dividends corresponds to the maximum income tax rate applicable to corporate non us shareholders but is higher than the and maximum rates on capital gains generally applicable to noncorporate non us shareholders 
treasury regulations also provide special rules to determine whether  for purposes of determining the applicability of a tax treaty  our distributions to a non us shareholder that is an entity should be treated as paid to the entity or to those owning an interest in that entity  and whether the entity or its owners are entitled to benefits under the tax treaty 
if our shares are not united states real property interests within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  a non us shareholder s gain on sale of these shares generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation  except that a nonresident alien individual who was in the united states for days or more during the taxable year will be subject to a tax on this gain 
our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we are a domestically controlled reit 
a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during the preceding five year period less than in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign persons 
we believe that we are and will be a domestically controlled reit and thus a non us shareholder s gain on sale of our shares will not be subject to united states federal income taxation 
however  because our shares are publicly traded  we can provide no assurance that we will be a domestically controlled reit 
if we are not a domestically controlled reit  a non us shareholder s gain on sale of our shares will not be subject to united states federal income taxation as a sale of a united states real property interest  if that class of shares is regularly traded  as defined by applicable treasury regulations  on an established securities market like the new york stock exchange  and the non us shareholder has at all times during the preceding five years owned or less by value of that class of shares 
if the gain on the sale of our shares were subject to united states federal income taxation  the non us shareholder will generally be subject to the same treatment as a us shareholder with respect to its gain  will be required to file a united states federal income tax return reporting that gain  and a corporate non us shareholder might owe branch profits tax under section of the internal revenue code 
a purchaser of our shares from a non us shareholder will not be required to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are regularly traded on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit 
otherwise  a purchaser of our shares from a non us shareholder may be required to withhold of the purchase price paid to the non us shareholder and to remit the withheld amount to the irs 
capital gain dividends that are received by a non us shareholder  including dividends attributable to our sales of united states real property interests  and that are deductible by us in respect of our taxable year and thereafter will be subject to the taxation and withholding regime applicable to ordinary income dividends and the branch profits tax will not apply  provided that the capital gain dividends are received with respect to a class of shares that is regularly traded  as defined by applicable treasury regulations  on an established securities market like the new york stock exchange and the foreign shareholder does not own more than of that class of shares at any time during the taxable year in which the capital gain dividends are received 
as such  qualifying non us shareholders will no longer be subject to withholding on capital gain dividends as though those amounts were effectively connected with a united states trade or business  and qualifying non us shareholders will no longer be required to file united states federal income tax returns or pay branch profits tax in respect of these capital gain dividends 
these recharacterized dividends will still be subject to united states federal income tax and withholding as ordinary dividends  currently at a tax rate as reduced by applicable treaty 
backup withholding and information reporting information reporting and backup withholding may apply to distributions or proceeds paid to our shareholders under the circumstances discussed below 
the backup withholding rate is currently 
amounts withheld under backup withholding are generally not an additional tax and may be refunded by the irs or credited against the reit shareholder s federal income tax liability 
a us shareholder will be subject to backup withholding when it receives distributions on our shares or proceeds upon the sale  exchange  redemption  retirement or other disposition of our shares  unless the us shareholder properly executes  or has previously properly executed  under penalties of perjury an irs form w or substantially similar form that provides the us shareholder s correct taxpayer identification number  and certifies that the us shareholder is exempt from backup withholding because it is a corporation or comes within another exempt category  it has not been notified by the irs that it is subject to backup withholding  or it has been notified by the irs that it is no longer subject to backup withholding 
if the us shareholder has not and does not provide its correct taxpayer identification number on the irs form w or substantially similar form  it may be subject to penalties imposed by the irs  and the reit or other withholding agent may have to withhold a portion of any capital gain distributions paid to it 
unless the us shareholder has established on a properly executed irs form w or substantially similar form that it is a corporation or comes within another exempt category  distributions on our shares paid to it during the calendar year  and the amount of tax withheld  if any  will be reported to it and to the irs 
distributions on our shares to a non us shareholder during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld  if any  will generally be reported to the non us shareholder and to the irs 
this information reporting requirement applies regardless of whether the non us shareholder is subject to withholding on distributions on our shares or whether the withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty 
also  distributions paid to a non us shareholder on our shares may be subject to backup withholding  unless the non us shareholder properly certifies its non us shareholder status on an irs form w or substantially similar form in the manner described above 
similarly  information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to proceeds a non us shareholder receives upon the sale  exchange  redemption  retirement or other disposition of our shares  if the non us shareholder properly certifies its non us shareholder status on an irs form w or substantially similar form 
even without having executed an irs form w or substantially similar form  however  in some cases information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to proceeds that a non us shareholder receives upon the sale  exchange  redemption  retirement or other disposition of our shares if the non us shareholder receives those proceeds through a broker s foreign office 
other tax consequences our tax treatment and that of our shareholders may be modified by legislative  judicial  or administrative actions at any time  which actions may be retroactive in effect 
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by the congress  the irs and the treasury department  and statutory changes  new regulations  revisions to existing regulations  and revised interpretations of established concepts are issued frequently 
likewise  the rules regarding taxes other than federal income taxes may also be modified 
no prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions or the direct or indirect effect on us and our shareholders 
revisions to tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax or other consequences of an investment in our shares 
we and our shareholders may also be subject to taxation by state  local or other jurisdictions  including those in which we or our shareholders transact business or reside 
these tax consequences may not be comparable to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 
erisa plans  keogh plans and individual retirement accounts general fiduciary obligations fiduciaries of a pension  profit sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to title i of the employee retirement income security act of  erisa  must consider whether their investment in our shares satisfies the diversification requirements of erisa  the investment is prudent in light of possible limitations on the marketability of our shares  they have authority to acquire our shares under the applicable governing instrument and title i of erisa  and the investment is otherwise consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities 
trustees and other fiduciaries of an erisa plan may incur personal liability for any loss suffered by the plan on account of a violation of their fiduciary responsibilities 
in addition  these fiduciaries may be subject to a civil penalty of up to of any amount recovered by the plan on account of a violation 
fiduciaries of any ira  roth ira  keogh plan or other qualified retirement plan not subject to title i of erisa  referred to as non erisa plans  should consider that a plan may only make investments that are authorized by the appropriate governing instrument 
fiduciary shareholders should consult their own legal advisors if they have any concern as to whether the investment is consistent with the foregoing criteria 
prohibited transactions fiduciaries of erisa plans and persons making the investment decision for an ira or other non erisa plan should consider the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of erisa and the internal revenue code in making their investment decision 
sales and other transactions between an erisa or non erisa plan  and persons related to it  are prohibited transactions 
the particular facts concerning the sponsorship  operations and other investments of an erisa plan or non erisa plan may cause a wide range of other persons to be treated as disqualified persons or parties in interest with respect to it 
a prohibited transaction  in addition to imposing potential personal liability upon fiduciaries of erisa plans  may also result in the imposition of an excise tax under the internal revenue code or a penalty under erisa upon the disqualified person or party in interest with respect to the plan 
if the disqualified person who engages in the transaction is the individual on behalf of whom an ira or roth ira is maintained or his beneficiary  the ira or roth ira may lose its tax exempt status and its assets may be deemed to have been distributed to the individual in a taxable distribution on account of the prohibited transaction  but no excise tax will be imposed 
fiduciary shareholders should consult their own legal advisors as to whether the ownership of our shares involves a prohibited transaction 
plan assets considerations the department of labor  which has administrative responsibility over erisa plans as well as non erisa plans  has issued a regulation defining plan assets 
the regulation generally provides that when an erisa or non erisa plan acquires a security that is an equity interest in an entity and that security is neither a publicly offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the investment company act of  the erisa plan s or non erisa plan s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity  unless it is established either that the entity is an operating company or that equity participation in the entity by benefit plan investors is not significant 
each class of our shares that is  our common shares and any class of preferred shares that we have issued or may issue must be analyzed separately to ascertain whether it is a publicly offered security 
the regulation defines a publicly offered security as a security that is widely held  freely transferable and either part of a class of securities registered under the exchange act  or sold under an effective registration statement under the securities act of  as amended  provided the securities are registered under the exchange act within days after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which the offering occurred 
each class of our outstanding shares has been registered under the exchange act 
the regulation provides that a security is widely held only if it is part of a class of securities that is owned by or more investors independent of the issuer and of one another 
however  a security will not fail to be widely held because the number of independent investors falls below subsequent to the initial public offering as a result of events beyond the issuer s control 
our common shares and our preferred shares have been widely held and we expect our common shares and our preferred shares to continue to be widely held 
we expect the same to be true of any additional class of preferred stock that we may issue  but we can give no assurance in that regard 
the regulation provides that whether a security is freely transferable is a factual question to be determined on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances 
the regulation further provides that  where a security is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is  or less  some restrictions on transfer ordinarily will not  alone or in combination  affect a finding that these securities are freely transferable 
the restrictions on transfer enumerated in the regulation as not affecting that finding include any restriction on or prohibition against any transfer or assignment which would result in a termination or reclassification for federal or state tax purposes  or would otherwise violate any state or federal law or court order  any requirement that advance notice of a transfer or assignment be given to the issuer and any requirement that either the transferor or transferee  or both  execute documentation setting forth representations as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer which are among those enumerated in the regulation as not affecting free transferability  including those described in the preceding clause of this sentence  any administrative procedure which establishes an effective date  or an event prior to which a transfer or assignment will not be effective  and any limitation or restriction on transfer or assignment which is not imposed by the issuer or a person acting on behalf of the issuer 
we believe that the restrictions imposed under our declaration of trust on the transfer of shares do not result in the failure of our shares to be freely transferable 
furthermore  we believe that there exist no other facts or circumstances limiting the transferability of our shares which are not included among those enumerated as not affecting their free transferability under the regulation  and we do not expect or intend to impose in the future  or to permit any person to impose on our behalf  any limitations or restrictions on transfer which would not be among the enumerated permissible limitations or restrictions 
assuming that each class of our shares will be widely held and that no other facts and circumstances exist which restrict transferability of these shares  we have received an opinion of our counsel  sullivan worcester llp  that our shares will not fail to be freely transferable for purposes of the regulation due to the restrictions on transfer of the shares under our declaration of trust and that under the regulation each class of our currently outstanding shares is publicly offered and our assets will not be deemed to be plan assets of any erisa plan or non erisa plan that invests in our shares

seven of the nine ground leases require minimum annual rent ranging from approximately  to  per year  rent under two ground leases has been pre paid 
generally payments of ground lease obligations are made by our manager or tenant 
however  if a manager or tenant did not perform obligations under a ground lease or elected not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel 
any pledge of our interests in a ground lease may also require the consent of the applicable ground lessor and its lenders

hotel industry conditions as a result of terrorism concerns  the war with iraq and the impact of a recessionary economy  the us hotel industry experienced significant declines in occupancy  revenues and profitability in  and during  the us hotel industry benefited from an expanding economy and limited new hotel supply 
for  seven of our eight combinations of hotels reported increases in revenue per available room  or revpar  however hotel profitability generally remained below levels 
all of our operating agreements and leases contain security features  such as security deposits and in certain instances  guarantees  which are intended to protect payment of owner s priority returns and minimum rents to us 
however  the effectiveness of these various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if the profitability of our hotels continues at the current level for an extended period 
if any of our hotel operators  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our revenues and cash flows may decline and our ability to continue to pay dividends may be jeopardized 
recent developments agreement with prime hospitality corp 
on december   we entered into an agreement with prime for the management of of our hotels former wyndham hotels and amerisuites hotels 
this agreement was effective january   with respect to the amerisuites hotels and was effective february   with respect to the prime hotels sm 
this agreement provided that our wyndham hotels would be rebranded as prime hotels sm and that our amerisuites hotels would continue to be operated as amerisuites 
this agreement provides that prime pay us an owner s priority return of  per year plus of cash flow after payment of operating costs  payment of our priority return  funding the ff e reserve and reimbursement of working capital and guaranty advances  if any 
prime provided a limited guarantee of our priority return of  per year 
this agreement has an initial term expiring in and prime has two consecutive renewal options for years each  thereafter 
in october  prime was sold to the blackstone group  or blackstone 
in january  blackstone sold the amerisuites brand and transferred operating responsibility for these hotels to hyatt 
we believe the transfer of operating responsibility from prime to hyatt was a breach of our agreement with prime 
pursuant to a guarantee given by prime and being honored by blackstone and hyatt  the minimum returns due to us have continued to be timely paid 
however  as a result of the revpar declines at the prime hotels sm  this hotel combination experienced a decline in revpar and the income that we realized from these hotels is less than we would have realized without such declines 
we are currently having discussions with hyatt concerning the operating plans for all of these hotels with particular reference to hyatt s plans to improve operations at the prime hotels sm 
if we cannot reach agreement with hyatt regarding these matters  we may decide to assign operations for some or all of these hotels to a new operator and to seek remedies which may be available to us from hyatt  prime and or blackstone 
agreement with intercontinental 
on december   we agreed to purchase hotels from intercontinental  for  the hotels include four full service intercontinental hotels  four full service crowne plaza hotels  three full service holiday inn hotels and two staybridge suites hotels  and have a total of  rooms suites and approximately  square feet of meeting rooms 
the hotels are located in six states in the united states  one intercontinental hotel and one staybridge suites hotel are located in toronto  canada  and one intercontinental hotel is located in san juan  puerto rico 
the  purchase price includes  which we have agreed to pay intercontinental during the three years following the closing in connection with certain improvements to the hotels 
on february   we completed the acquisition of of the hotels 
the purchase of one intercontinental hotel with an allocated purchase price of  was delayed and is expected to be completed by june  changed circumstances may further delay this purchase or prevent its occurring 
simultaneously with our purchase of these hotels  we entered a long term combination management agreement for of the hotels and a long term lease for one hotel  the intercontinental hotel in san juan  puerto rico  with subsidiaries of intercontinental 
when the acquisition of the remaining hotel is completed  it will be added to the management agreement for the hotels purchased on february  the combined annual amount payable to us for all hotels as owner s priority return under the management agreement and base rent under the lease is  in  increases to  in and increases to approximately  after the full  purchase price has been paid 
in addition  we are entitled to receive cash flow remaining after base and incentive management fees are paid to intercontinental at the managed hotels and  starting in  a percentage of increases in gross revenues over a threshold at each of the hotels 
the owner s priority return under the management agreement and the base rent under the lease are measured and payable in us dollars 
other amounts due under these agreements  with respect to the two hotels located in canada  may be measured in canadian dollars  but will be payable in us dollars 
the management agreement and the lease will each extend through  and intercontinental has two all or none renewal options for years each 
the obligations to pay owner s priority return under the management agreement and the base rent under the lease are supported by a limited  partial guaranty from intercontinental until the operations at these hotels reach negotiated levels 
further  the obligation to pay the owner s priority return under the management agreement is also supported by a limited  partial guaranty from the intercontinental subsidiary tenant for the puerto rico hotel 
the agreements also provide for a reserve for capital expenditures starting in management agreements and leases as of december   each of our hotels is included in one of eight combinations of hotels which is either leased to one of our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  and managed by an independent hotel operating company or leased to a third party 
at december   we had managed hotels and leased hotels 
our consolidated income statement includes hotel operating revenues and expenses of our managed hotels  and only rental income for leased hotels 
with the closing of the acquisition of hotels from intercontinental on february   described above  we own hotels of which are managed and leased

hotel operating expenses for our managed hotels  including expenses for periods prior to our ownership of some of these hotels and for periods when some of the hotels were leased from us by third parties  were  in  a decrease of from hotel operating expenses of  in this decrease is due primarily to lower franchise related costs at certain of our rebranded hotels partially offset by increased wage and benefit costs 
certain of our managed hotels had net operating results that were  and  less than the minimum returns due to us in and  respectively 
these amounts have been reflected in our consolidated statement of income as a net reduction to hotel operating expenses in each year because the minimum returns were funded by our managers 
the decrease in rental income is primarily a result of the elimination of  of minimum rent for of our hotels which were previously leased to third parties but are now managed for our account by independent hotel operating companies 
this decrease was partially offset by increased rental income resulting from our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels in and and an increase in percentage rent due to increased sales at our leased hotels in versus ff e reserve income represents amounts paid by our tenants into restricted accounts owned by us  the purpose of which is to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures 
the terms of our leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels 
the increase in ff e reserve income is primarily due to increased levels of hotel sales versus at certain of our recently modernized courtyard by marriott hotels 
this increase is partially offset by six hotels under our agreement with marriott which were changed from leased to managed hotels during and seven additional hotels under this agreement which were changed from leased to managed hotels in june the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels and for leased hotels where the ff e reserve is owned by our tenants are not reported as ff e reserve income in our consolidated statement of income 
the decrease in interest income is due to a lower average cash balance  offset to some extent by a higher average interest rate during we recorded a gain on the sale of a summerfield suites hotel located in buckhead  georgia in the second quarter 
we recorded a  gain on lease terminations in as a result of the termination of our leases with wyndham and candlewood 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average borrowings and a higher weighted average interest rate during the increase in depreciation and amortization is due principally to the depreciation of hotels acquired during and the impact of the purchases in and of depreciable assets with funds from ff e reserve accounts owned by us 
this is offset to some extent by the sale of one hotel in and the retirement of fully depreciated assets of  and  throughout and  respectively 
the increase to general and administrative expense is due principally to the impact of additional hotel investments during and and due diligence costs of approximately incurred in in connection with a failed potential acquisition 
in  we recorded an expense of  to write off the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with  of senior notes we redeemed 
the decreases in net income  net income available for common shareholders and net income available for common shareholders per common share were primarily due to the gain on lease terminations recorded in and the other investment and operating activities discussed above 
the decrease in net income available for common shareholders per common share was also impacted by our sale of million common shares in february and march cash flow from operations was  in  a increase from  in primarily due to changes in items affecting net income discussed above

this decrease is attributable primarily to the general slowdown of business travel in the united states and the impact of changes in management of some of our hotels resulting from tenant lease defaults 
hotel operating expenses for our managed hotels  including expenses which relate to periods prior to our ownership of some of these hotels and for periods when some of the hotels were leased from us by third parties  were  in  a increase from hotel operating expenses of  in this increase is due primarily to higher wage and benefits costs

these amounts have been reflected in our consolidated statement of income as a net reduction to hotel operating expenses in each year because the minimum returns were funded by our managers 
the decrease in rental income is due primarily to the elimination of  of rental income in for the hotels previously leased to wyndham which began to be managed by third parties in april and may  the replacement of  of rental income under our agreement with marriott with hotel operating revenues and expenses for hotels which were changed from leased to managed hotels during and and decreased percentage rent due to lower hotel sales at our leased hotels and the impact of lease defaults in these decreases were partially offset by rental income resulting from our acquisition of candlewood hotels in april and seven candlewood hotels in july  and from returns from our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels during and the decrease in ff e reserve income is due primarily to reduced levels of hotel sales attributable to the general slowdown of business travel across the united states and the lease defaults described above 
part of this decrease is also due to activities related to the hotels under our agreement with marriott which were leased and began to be managed at various times during and  as discussed above 
the increase in interest income is due to a higher average cash balance  offset to some extent by a lower average interest rate during we recorded a  gain on lease terminations in  as a result of the termination of our leases with wyndham and candlewood 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average borrowings  partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate during the increase in depreciation and amortization is due principally to the impact of the depreciation of hotels acquired in july of and the hotels acquired in april  capital improvements we funded at some of our courtyard by marriott hotels and the impact of the acquisition of depreciable assets during and purchased with funds from ff e reserve accounts owned by us and other funds 
this increase was partially offset by the retirement of fully depreciated assets of  and  throughout and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expense is due principally to the impact of additional hotel investments during and we recorded expenses on the early extinguishment of debt of  and  on february  and july   respectively  to write off the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with  and  respectively  of senior notes we redeemed 
the increases in net income  net income available for common shareholders and net income available for common shareholders per common share were primarily due to the gain on lease terminations recorded in  and the other investment and operating activities discussed above 
cash flow from operations was  in  a increase from  in primarily due to the impact of changes in working capital 
cash used in investing activities was  in  a increase from  in  primarily because we purchased a greater number of hotels in cash provided by financing activities was  in  a increase over cash used in financing activities of  in  primarily because of increased borrowings to fund our hotel acquisitions  offset partially by our preferred equity issuance in and increased distributions on common and preferred shares in liquidity and capital resources our operators and tenants as of march   all of our hotels are operated under management agreements or leases with unrelated third party hotel operating companies 
all costs of operating and maintaining our hotels are paid by the third party hotel managers as agent for us or by third party hotel tenants for their own account 
these third parties derive their funding for hotel operating expenses  ff e reserves  and returns and rents due us generally from hotel operating revenues and  to the extent that these parties fund our returns and minimum rents under their guarantees to us  from their separate resources 
we define coverage for each of our combination hotel management agreements or leases as total hotel sales minus all expenses which are not subordinated to minimum payments to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the aggregate minimum payments to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features of our nine agreements is presented in the table on pages and of our eight operating agreements in place during  four hotel combinations  representing hotels  generated coverage of at least x during the remaining four combinations  representing hotels  generated coverages of 
x to 
x in two hundred twenty six hotels we own in seven combinations  of our total investments  at cost  are operated under management agreements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if combined total hotel sales less total hotel expenses and required ff e reserve payments fail to equal or exceed amounts due to us 
our managers and tenants or their affiliates may also supplement cash flow from our hotels in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our hotels 
guarantee or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our management agreements or leases  do not subject us to repayment obligations but  under some of our agreements  these guarantee or supplemental payments may be recovered by the third party operator or tenant from the future cash flows from our hotels after our future minimum returns and rents are paid 
as of march   all payments due  including those payments due under leases or operating agreements whose hotels have generated less than x coverage during  are current 
however  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if the profitability of our hotels continues at the current level for an extended period 
if any of our hotel operators  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our revenues and cash flows may decline 
our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels and minimum rents from our leased properties 
we receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly 
we receive our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels in excess of minimum returns and percentage rents either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  interest and distributions 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
we maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
in  federal legislation known as the reit modernization act  or the rma  was enacted and became effective on january  the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to a trs if the hotel is managed by an independent third party 
the income realized by our trs in excess of the rent it pays to us is subject to income tax at corporate tax rates 
as  and if  the financial performance of the hotels operated for the account of our trs improves  these taxes may become material  but the anticipated taxes are not material to our consolidated financial results at this time 
our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at most of our hotels are escrowed as ff e reserves 
as of december   there was approximately  on deposit in these escrow accounts  of which  was held directly by us and reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
the remaining is held in an account owned by one of our tenants and is not reflected on our balance sheet  but we have security and remainder interests in the account owned by this tenant 
during   was contributed to these accounts and  was spent from these accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate occasional cash needs that may result from timing differences between the receipt of rents and returns and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks 
our credit facility matures in june and may be extended at our option to june upon our payment of an extension fee 
borrowings under the credit facility can be up to  and the credit facility includes a feature under which the maximum amount available for borrowing may be expanded to  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our credit facility are unsecured 
funds may be drawn  repaid and redrawn until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility per annum at december  is payable at a spread above libor 
as of december   we had  outstanding on our facility 
we are currently having preliminary discussions with the lead lender of our credit facility concerning possible enlargement and extension of our credit facility 
at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and  available on our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our credit facility or other lines of credit and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions 
as described above  on december   we announced our agreement to purchase hotels from intercontinental for  we acquired of the hotels on february   for approximately  using proceeds from the senior notes issuance described below and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to complete the purchase of the final hotel for  by june   using existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the  purchase price includes  which we have agreed to pay intercontinental during the next three years in connection with certain improvements to the hotels 
we expect to fund  for improvements to three of our marriott hotel portfolios in with funds from existing cash balances or borrowings under our credit facility 
our minimum annual rent for these hotels will increase by approximately of the amounts we fund  which amounts are in addition to recurring ff e reserve funding from hotel operations 
pursuant to our agreement with intercontinental for management of staybridge suites hotels part of a hotel combination  we agreed to fund  for rebranding costs and other capital improvements 
as part of this agreement  intercontinental will provide us with a  deposit to secure its obligations under the management agreement that we will not escrow 
the timing of our funding to intercontinental and its funding of the deposit to us are expected to be simultaneous 
as of december    of these fundings have occurred and the balance is expected to occur in pursuant to the agreement we entered with prime on december   for management of hotels  we agreed to fund  for rebranding costs and other capital improvements during as of december    of funding has occurred 
the balance of this funding is expected to occur during  although it may be delayed because of our current discussions with hyatt as described above 
our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility are as follows  in   in   in and  in as of december   we had one mortgage note we assumed in connection with our acquisition of a hotel with a principal balance of  this mortgage note requires monthly payments of principal and interest of and is expected to have a principal balance of  at maturity in the mortgage note is prepayable at a premium beginning on august  none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity date 
on december   a distribution of per series b preferred share was declared with respect to fourth quarter and was paid to shareholders on january  on december   a distribution of per common share was declared with respect to fourth quarter results and was paid to shareholders on january   using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   we sold  of our common shares in a public offering at per share 
on march   we sold an additional  common shares of beneficial interest at per share pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
net proceeds  from both these sales  after underwriting and other offering expenses  were  these proceeds were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on april   we redeemed all of our outstanding series a preferred shares at their liquidation preference of per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions of per share 
this redemption was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   we issued  of senior notes due net proceeds after underwriting and other offering expenses were approximately  as described above  these proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of hotels from intercontinental on february  when amounts are outstanding on our revolving credit facility and  as the maturity dates of our credit facility and term debt approach over the longer term  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional long term debt and issuing new equity securities 
as of december   we had  available on our shelf registration 
this amount was reduced by our february issuance of  of senior notes due to  an effective shelf registration allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for those securities 
although there can be no assurance that we will consummate any debt or equity security offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financing  including investment grade debt or equity securities offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions and to pay our debt and other obligations 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations purchase obligation ground lease obligations capital improvements total on december   we announced our agreement to purchase hotels from intercontinental 
we acquired of the hotels on february  for approximately  nine of our hotels are on leased land 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payment of ground lease obligations are made by our managers or tenants 
however  if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel 
represents amounts we expect to fund in addition to recurring ff e reserve funding from hotel operations 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  guarantees  joint ventures or partnerships 
as of december   our secured debt obligations were limited to one mortgage note of  secured by a single property 
none of our debt documentation requires us to provide collateral security in the event of a ratings downgrade 
debt covenants our debt obligations at december   were our revolving credit facility  our  of publicly issued term debt and our  mortgage note 
our public debt is governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our credit facility agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our bank credit facility contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our credit facility agreement  our senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rate applied to borrowings 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of  or more 
similarly  a default on our public debt indenture would be a default on our credit facility

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our four most critical accounting policies concern our investments in hotels and are as follows classification of leases 
certain of our hotel investments are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased hotel  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
allocation of purchase price and recognition of depreciation expense 
the acquisition cost of each hotel investment is allocated to various property components such as land  buildings and improvements  and each component generally has a different useful life 
for hotels acquired subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocate the value of real estate acquired among building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships 
acquisition cost allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on our estimates or  under some circumstances  studies commissioned from independent experts 
we compute related depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
the value of intangible assets is amortized over the term of the respective lease 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs or incorrect estimates of useful lives could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
impairment of assets 
we periodically evaluate our hotel investments for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related hotel investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that hotel 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
variable interest entities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  that was effective for all enterprises with variable interest entities created after january  in december  fasb issued a revised fin  which provided for the deferral of the effective date of the interpretation to january   for variable interest entities created prior to january  under fin  if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
generally  expected losses and expected residual returns are the expected negative and positive variability  respectively  in the fair value of the variable interest entities net assets 
when our trs enters a new operating agreement or materially modifies an existing operating agreement we are required to assess if we are or continue to be the primary beneficiary 
this assessment requires us to make estimates of the future cash flows of our trs 
incorrect assumptions or estimates of  among other things  occupancy  average daily room rate and operating expenses of our hotels may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary 
the adoption of fin had no effect on our financial statements 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our hotels operate 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to hotels we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
property management agreements  leases and operating statistics as of march   we owned hotels which are grouped into nine combinations and managed by or leased to separate affiliates of hotel operating companies including intercontinental  marriott  host marriott corporation  or host  barcelo crestline corporation  or barcelo crestline  hyatt  and bre homestead village  llc  or homestead

see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operaion recent developments in this annual report on form k for the current status of these operating arrangements 
seasonality our hotels have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of the us hotel industry with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income because our contractual management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our rents and return payments to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
seasonality may affect our hotel operating revenues  but we do not expect seasonal variations to have a material impact upon our financial results of operations or upon our operators or tenants ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage returns and rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross hotel revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our operators or tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased operating costs at our properties  all of our operating agreements contain security features  such as security deposits and in certain instances  guarantees of our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future 
the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
as of march   our outstanding publicly traded debt consisted of five issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually issued on february  no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
if at maturity these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately  changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at march   and discounted cash flow analyses  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately  each of our fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
we have one mortgage payable secured by a hotel in wichita  kansas  with a fixed rate of that matures on july  this note requires principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to an amortization schedule and contains a provision that allows us to make repayment at a premium to face value after august  our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in june we can extend the maturity for one year for a fee 
at december   we had  outstanding and  available for drawing under our revolving credit facility 
repayments under our revolving credit facility may be made at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility are subject to interest at libor plus a premium 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding indebtedness of  at december   was per annum 
the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on floating rate interest expense as of december  impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving bank credit facility or other floating rate debt
