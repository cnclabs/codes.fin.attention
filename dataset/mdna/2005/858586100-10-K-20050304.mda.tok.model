item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some information contained in the management s discussion and analysis is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties 
the results achieved this year are not necessarily an indication of future prospects for the company 
actual results in future years may differ materially 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  fluctuations in the volume and timing of product orders  changes in demand for the company s products  changes in technology  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace  availability of raw materials  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications all over the world 
the overall business comprises three reportable segments surfactants surfactants  which accounted for percent of total net sales  are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes  dishes  carpets  floors and walls  as well as shampoos  lotions  fabric softeners  toothpastes and cosmetics 
other applications include germicidal quaternary compounds  lubricating ingredients  emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products  and plastics and composites 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites five in the united states us and one in canada  three european sites and two latin american sites 
on january   the company began producing in brazil following the purchase of a local unilever subsidiary 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of total net sales  include three primary product lines phthalic anhydride pa  polyurethane polyols and polyurethane systems 
pa is used in polyester alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
polyurethane polyols are used in the manufacture of laminate insulation board for the construction industry and are also sold to the appliance  coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyurethane systems provide thermal insulation and are sold to the construction  industrial and appliance markets 
in the us  polymer product lines are manufactured at one site 
the company also began manufacturing polyurethane polyols at its german facility in in  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with sinopec  jinling petrochemical corporation in nanjing  china 
the joint venture was formed to manufacture the company s aromatic polyester polyols for china s domestic market 
construction of a manufacturing facility in nanjing is expected to be completed by mid specialty products specialty products  which accounted for three percent of total net sales  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are manufactured primarily at one us site 
because of the diverse markets it serves  the company has numerous competitors 
the company generally competes on price  product performance and the ability to meet specific 
table of contents needs of customers 
in some instances  particularly for the surfactants segment  the company competes with internal manufacturing capabilities of its customers 
the impact of such competition  particularly when combined with excess capacity in the chemical industry  was felt in late  all of and the first half as the company lost sales volume in its surfactants business when two major customers shifted business from the company into the customers own internal production facilities 
by the second half of  the culmination of small to moderate sales volume gains for numerous company product lines had offset the effects of the lost business 
a number of the company s key raw materials and energy sources are commodities  principally natural gas used to power the company s plants and petroleum based and plant based materials  whose prices fluctuate due to weather  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
during and  raw material costs increased due to instability in the middle east and to tight supplies resulting from greater material consumption by china and other parts of asia 
this trend is likely to continue in the near future 
increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements with the company that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent raw material costs from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods when there is excess industry capacity 
accordingly  some product lines or market segments may take time to recover raw material cost increases 
this was true in european markets during  particularly with respect to the company s united kingdom subsidiary 
the company relies heavily on processing equipment to manufacture its products 
in that sense  the company is capital intensive  and therefore  its manufacturing costs are relatively fixed in nature 
as a result  gross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales is susceptible to disproportionate declines when volume decreases 
such cost behavior played an important role in the company s decreased profitability in improved sales volume in  coupled with the benefit of a salary freeze and the asset impairment charge  helped earnings recover from the impact of the volume decline in the company s operating expenses  which include marketing  administrative and research and development expenses  are predisposed to period to period fluctuations due principally to the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans  obligations associated with environmental remediation liabilities and the impact on translation of fluctuations in foreign currencies 
the company operates in a setting of extensive local  state and federal regulations concerning the environment 
the company has been named as a potentially responsible party  to perform environmental remediation at the company s expense  at a number of geographic sites 
the company believes it has adequate reserves for all known environmental sites  but an adverse determination could result in a significant negative effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in  fluctuations related to deferred compensation plans and environmental matters resulted in a million decline in administrative expenses versus for further discussions of these matters  see the environmental and legal matters and critical accounting policies sections of this management discussion and analysis 
the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation added million to operating expenses in  as the european euro  british pound sterling and the canadian dollar all grew stronger against the us dollar during 
table of contents despite a percent year to year increase in net income  was a challenging year 
the effect of sales volume growth was largely offset by rapidly escalating raw material prices 
management is optimistic about business fundamentals are favorable  particularly in north america 
sales volume for the polymers segment should continue to grow due to strong demand and greater market penetration 
the company continues to pursue new surfactant opportunities in soap bars and fabric softeners 
management also believes that european margins and volume should improve 
during the fourth quarter of  a primary competitor of the company announced plans to shut down its united kingdom surfactant plant 
while the earnings contribution from the company s chinese joint venture are expected to be minimal in construction of the polyester polyol facility is expected to be complete by mid year  management believes that  longer term  there is upside potential for this plant in serving asia s construction market 
the company s research efforts will continue to focus on innovation into new markets or higher margin applications in existing markets 
building on the improvement in profits is essential to achieving the company s operating margin and return on capital goals 
results of operations compared with summary net income for increased million  or percent  to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the weak prior year net income included million  or per diluted share  for environmental remediation charges  an asset write down  severance and higher deferred compensation expense 
below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year improvement in net income 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
consolidated net sales increased million  or percent  to million for from million for approximately million of the increase was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  due particularly to the strengthening euro  british pound sterling and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
all three segments reported year to year increases in net sales dollars 
surfactants segment net sales were up million  or percent  due to higher selling prices  favorable foreign currency translation and increased sales volumes 
net sales for the polymers segment increased million  or percent  due primarily to higher selling prices and higher sales volume 
the specialty products segment reported a million  or eight percent  increase in net sales due to higher sales volumes of food ingredient and pharmaceutical products 
operating income was up million  or percent  to million for from million for all three segments reported higher operating income in than in higher sales volumes across all segments and a favorable sales mix  particularly for domestic surfactants  contributed to the operating income improvement 
in addition  million of expenses for asset impairment losses did not recur in however  high raw material costs continued to temper profits  particularly in europe where competitive pressures made it difficult to recover escalating raw material costs through selling price increases 
operating expenses  which include 
table of contents marketing  administrative and research and development expenses  declined million  or two percent  to million for from million for most of the decline was in administrative expenses  which reflected a million decrease in deferred compensation expense and a million decrease in legal and environmental expenses 
in addition  operating expenses included million of separation costs related to a planned reduction in the us workforce 
the foregoing reductions were partially offset by the million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation of the company s foreign subsidiary operating expenses 
for additional details regarding the fluctuations of net sales and operating income  see the segment results discussion that follows this summary 
interest expense declined million  or percent  between years due to a higher proportion of bank debt  which carries lower interest rates than the company s long term notes 
income from the company s philippine joint venture increased million between years 
income in the other  net  caption  which includes foreign exchange gains and losses and investment related income and expense  fell million from year to year 
the other  net result reflected million of foreign exchange loss in compared to million of exchange gain in in addition  results for included investment related income of million compared to investment related expense of million in the effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for the higher effective tax rate was primarily attributable to factors that lowered the effective rate and did not reoccur 
in  the tax benefit realized on foreign joint venture equity income and federal and state tax credits increased as a percentage of consolidated income due to the decline in domestic operating results in that year 
in  the rate increased as a result of tax provided on a million dividend received from the company s philippine joint venture  which was more than offset by a tax benefit realized on a million charitable contribution of intellectual property during segment results dollars in thousands surfactants polymers specialty products segment results corporate total for the year ended december  net sales operating income for the year ended december  net sales operating income surfactants surfactants net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for approximately million of the increase was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  due particularly to the strengthening euro  british pound sterling and canadian 
table of contents dollar against the us dollar 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  surfactants net sales increased million or percent 
sales volume was up three percent from year to year 
domestic net sales increased million  or percent  on sales volume that increased one percent 
higher selling prices  due primarily to three current year price increases to partially pass rising raw material prices to customers  accounted for approximately million of the domestic net sales gain 
the first half decline in domestic sales volume that resulted from the prior year loss of business from two large customers who moved previously outsourced production into internal production facilities has been offset by the culmination of small to moderate sales volume gains for numerous company product lines 
the mix of sales has shifted somewhat as the sales volume gained tended to have higher unit selling prices than the sales volume lost 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  net sales for foreign operations increased million  or percent  on a seven percent volume increase 
the company s mexican and european operations accounted for most of the improvement in foreign operations net sales  reporting increases of million and million  respectively 
sales volume for mexican operations increased percent due to an increase in fabric softener sales volume 
sales volume for european operations increased six percent between years 
surfactants operating income for increased million  or two percent  over operating income reported for excluding the effects of currency translation  surfactants operating income increased million from year to year 
domestic operations operating income improved million  or percent  between years 
a more favorable mix of sales  along with the modest sales volume gain  accounted for about half of the domestic operating income growth 
also factoring into the year over year operating income improvement were million in expenses for impairment losses that did not recur in the impairment losses were recognized for equipment used in the manufacture of high viscosity paste at the company s millsdale joliet  illinois  plant 
this equipment represented a small portion of the plant s manufacturing capacity 
higher raw material costs  due to short supplies and high crude oil prices  dampened the year s operating income 
operating income for foreign operations fell million from year to year 
european operations reported an operating loss of million in  a drop of million from operating income of million  as higher raw material costs more than offset the effect of higher sales volume 
due to excess industry manufacturing capacity and vertically integrated competitors  attempts to raise selling prices in europe have not been successful in recovering all of the rapidly escalating raw material cost increases  particularly for the united kingdom subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s primary united kingdom competitor announced plans to shut down its surfactant plant 
operating income for the company s mexico subsidiary improved million on the strength of the aforementioned sales volume increase 
polymers polymers net sales increased million  or percent  from year to year 
higher selling prices  due primarily to partially passing raw material cost increases to customers  a percent increase in sales volume  and million of favorable foreign currency translation on european sales all led to the increase in net sales 
the higher selling prices accounted for approximately million of the year to year net sales improvement 
excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  polyurethane polyols net sales increased million  or percent  on sales volume that grew percent due primarily to an 
table of contents improved u 
s 
economy and to an increased share of the growing european laminate board market 
higher selling prices also contributed as the company benefited from three selling price increases  which passed a portion of raw material cost increases on to customers 
pa s net sales were up million  or percent  due to higher selling prices that resulted primarily from passing raw material cost increases on to customers and  to a lesser extent  from increasing manufacturing fees to merchant market customers twice in also contributing was sales volume that improved percent due largely to an improved economy 
sales volumes improved for all major customers 
polyurethane systems net sales improved million  or percent  on sales volume that increased percent due primarily to increased business with a customer that was first acquired during the second quarter of polymers operating income for increased million  or percent  over operating income for gross profit was up million  or percent  from year to year 
gross profit for polyurethane polyols increased million  or percent  due to the percent increase in sales volume and the benefit of a full year of internal production at the company s european polyurethane polyol plant  which commenced operations in july prior to july  the company outsourced most of its production of polyurethane polyols for the european market 
rising diethylene glycol and orthoxylene costs partially offset the effect of increased sales volume  particularly in the first half of the selling price increases that were attained in the second  third and fourth quarters minimized the effect of rising raw material costs in the second half of the year 
gross profit for pa increased million  or percent  due primarily to higher sales volume 
the manufacturing fee increases discussed above also contributed to the increase 
higher raw material costs somewhat tempered the year to year gross profit improvement 
gross profit for polyurethane systems declined million  or two percent  despite higher sales volume 
a change in sales mix coupled with higher raw material costs offset the effect of greater sales volume 
it is expected that polymer raw material costs will continue to increase in the near term 
as a result  first quarter selling prices were raised for polyurethane polyol products 
polymer operating expenses for were million  or eight percent  higher than operating expenses for domestic research expenses increased million due to an increased allocation of resources required to support the business 
european operating expenses were up million from year to year due to a full year of expenses for the german polyol facility that did not commence operations until the third quarter of and to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation 
specialty products net sales for were million  a million  or eight percent  increase from the million reported for operating income increased million  or percent  to million for from million for the net sales and operating income gains reflected increased volumes for food ingredient and pharmaceutical products 
operating expenses increased million  or six percent  primarily due to a higher allocation of research resources to support the business 
corporate expenses corporate expenses  which primarily include corporate administrative including legal and environmental expenses and corporate manufacturing expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments  decreased million  or seven percent  to million in from 
table of contents million in deferred compensation expense was down million from year to year to million in from million in a decrease in the company s common stock price to per share at december   from per share at december   led to the decline 
legal and environmental expenses fell million between years due primarily to million of additional remediation reserve requirements identified in no such expenses were necessary for general legal expenses were up million from year to year  partially offsetting the effect of the lower remediation expenses 
also contributing to the overall decline in corporate expenses were million of non recurring charges for separation costs associated with a planned reduction in the us work force 
current year expenses related to the company s enterprise resource planning erp system implementation project were approximately million higher than those of the prior year  as the company completed its installation of the erp system at its france and germany subsidiaries 
the implementation project is now complete 
results of operations compared with summary net income for fell million  or percent  to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for below is a summary discussion of the factors leading to the year to year drop in profitability 
a more detailed discussion of segment operating performance follows the summary 
consolidated net sales increased million  or five percent  to million in from million in the effects of foreign currency translation contributed million  or three percent  of the increase in consolidated net sales 
the remaining two percent increase in consolidated net sales was attributable primarily to sales price increases  as consolidated volumes were essentially flat with last year 
all three segments reported increases in net sales from year to year 
surfactants segment sales were up million  or three percent  due to favorable foreign currency translation and higher sales prices  as higher european volumes were offset by lower domestic  canadian and south american sales volume 
net sales for the polymers segment increased million  or percent  due primarily to higher selling prices that reflected rising raw material costs and higher sales volume 
the specialty products segment reported nearly flat year to year net sales 
despite the increase in net sales  operating income fell million  or percent  to million in from million in gross profit dropped million  or percent  from year to year  primarily due to lower domestic surfactants sales volume and higher surfactants and polymers raw material costs 
in addition  gross profit was unfavorably impacted by a million charge for impairment losses on specific surfactants equipment 
operating expenses  consisting of marketing  administrative and research and development expenses  increased million  or six percent  to million in from million in the year to year operating expense increase included million of environmental expenses related to remediation requirements at previously and currently owned facilities  a million increase in deferred compensation expense that resulted primarily from the appreciation in value of the mutual fund assets held for the deferred compensation plan  and a fourth quarter charge of million for separation costs associated with 
table of contents a five percent reduction in the company s domestic work force 
for additional details regarding the fluctuations in net sales  gross profit and operating income  see the segment results discussion that follows this overview 
interest expenses increased million  or nine percent  between years due to a higher proportion of fixed rate debt 
the company secured additional fixed rate debt in first half of to lock in low long term rates  although such rates are higher than current short term rates 
income from the company s philippine joint venture decreased to million in from million a year ago 
a change in product mix coupled with lower royalty income accounted for the drop in joint venture profit 
other  net  which includes foreign currency gains and losses and investment income and expense  increased million between years 
foreign currency exchange gains on european operations debt that is denominated in us dollars accounted for most of the increase 
the gains reflected the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the lower effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the tax benefit realized on foreign joint venture equity income and federal and state tax credits  which increased as a percentage of consolidated income due to the decline in domestic operating results 
the decrease is also attributable to a greater percentage of consolidated income being generated in foreign countries where the overall effective tax rate is lower 
segment results dollars in thousands surfactants polymers specialty products corporate total for the year ended december  net sales operating income for the year ended december  net sales operating income surfactants surfactants net sales increased million  or three percent  from year to year 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  due particularly to the strengthening euro and british pound sterling against the us dollar 
excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  net sales for foreign operations increased million  or six percent  on sales volume that increased four percent 
domestic net sales dropped million  or two percent  on sales volume that declined five percent 
european operations  most notably the company s uk subsidiary  accounted for the foreign volume gain 
the company s growing share of the uk s sulfonation market as well as new sales resulting from the late acquisition of the pentagon chemicals specialties biocides and specialty surfactants 
table of contents businesses led to the improvement in the uk operations volume 
the decline in domestic sales volume was due principally to the loss of business from two large customers who brought previously outsourced production into internal production facilities 
lost share at some smaller laundry and cleaning products customers  due to competitive situations  also contributed to the drop in volume 
the company had anticipated that growth in its fabric softener products would reduce the impact of the lost business  however  while fabric softener growth has occurred  it has not materialized as rapidly as originally projected 
surfactants operating income fell million  or percent  from to  primarily due to a gross profit decline of million  or percent  to million in from million in essentially all of the gross profit decline represents a domestic gross profit decrease of million  or percent  from year to year due to the previously noted five percent drop in sales volume 
because of the generally fixed nature of the company s manufacturing costs  gross profit is susceptible to significant declines when sales volumes fall as occurred in the company s us business in cost increases for a number of key surfactant raw materials also contributed to the lower domestic gross profit 
in addition to the lower sales volume and higher raw material costs  domestic gross profit was negatively affected by million of asset impairment losses related primarily to equipment located at the company s millsdale joliet  illinois plant that was specifically used for the processing of a product that will no longer be manufactured at that site 
no alternative use could be found for the equipment  which represented a very small portion of the plant s production capacity 
gross profit for foreign operations increased million  or three percent  between years 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  foreign gross profit fell million from year to year 
the positive impact of the sales volume increase was more than offset by higher raw material costs  particularly in europe 
operating expenses increased million  or percent  from to excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation  operating expenses declined million 
domestic research and development expense accounted for the decrease  which resulted from lower payroll related expenses and year to year reallocation of resources to the specialty products segment 
polymers polymer net sales increased million  or percent  from year to year 
higher prices  due primarily to passing recent raw material cost increases to customers  a four percent increase in sales volume and million of favorable foreign currency translation on european sales all led to the increase in net sales 
within the polymers segment  polyurethane polyols net sales increased million  or percent  on sales volume that grew percent due primarily to an improved us construction market that led to higher sales volumes to existing customers and from an increased share of the growing european laminate board market 
polyurethane systems net sales improved million  or percent  on sales volume that increased percent due to the acquisition of a major new customer during the year 
pa s net sales were down million  or three percent  on sales volume that declined five percent  as demand from two major customers declined in as a result of a shrinking share of their respective markets 
despite its increased net sales and sales volume  polymers operating income decreased million  or four percent  to million in from million in gross profit was up just million  or one percent  between years 
gross profit for polyurethane systems and pa improved million and million  respectively  while gross profit for polyurethane 
table of contents polyols dropped million 
the aforementioned sales volume increase accounted for the improvement in polyurethane systems gross profit 
pa s gross profit was positively impacted by lower manufacturing costs  particularly utilities and depreciation 
the decrease in polyurethane polyols gross profit was due to higher raw material costs that more than offset the effect of increased sales volume 
second quarter selling price increases were effective in passing on only a portion of the higher costs to customers 
polymer raw material prices are expected to increase further as global demand for ethylene and petroleum based products is high and current supplier inventories are low 
polymer operating expenses increased million  or nine percent  from year to year 
higher expense in europe led to million of the increase 
foreign currency translation accounted million of europe s increase  while the remainder of the change was due to higher administrative and marketing expenses supporting the new german facility 
domestic expense increased million due primarily to higher product development expenses 
specialty products net sales for the year were million  a million increase from the million reported a year ago 
despite the increase in net sales  operating income declined million  or percent  due to a lower sales volume of higher margin pharmaceutical products 
higher research expense also contributed to the operating income decline 
corporate expenses corporate expenses  which primarily include corporate administrative and corporate manufacturing expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments  increased million  or six percent  from million in to million in environmental expenses were up million between years due to contractual obligations for shared remediation costs associated with a formerly owned manufacturing site and anticipated remediation expenses for a currently owned facility 
a million increase in deferred compensation expense  arising primarily from the appreciation in value of the mutual fund investments held for the deferred compensation plan  contributed to the corporate expense increase for an explanation regarding the company s deferred compensation plan see the critical accounting policies section of this discussion also factoring into the higher corporate expenses was a fourth quarter charge of million for separation costs associated with a five percent reduction in the company s us work force 
the reduction in force  which was part of a strategy to reduce operating costs and streamline operations  was realized through a process of voluntary and involuntary terminations and through eliminating unfilled open positions 
costs associated with implementation of the company s erp system were down million due primarily to the completion of the north american implementation in the fourth quarter of stepan uk s erp implementation was completed in the fourth quarter of  and the erp implementation throughout the rest of europe will occur in a million recovery of settlement costs related to an old legal case also offset the corporate expense increases 

table of contents liquidity and financial condition net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for compared to million for net income increased by million from year to year 
offsetting the net income increase in was working capital  which was cash neutral compared to a cash source of million in accounts receivable increased during  reflecting generally higher selling prices 
accounts payable and inventories both increased  reflecting the impact of higher raw material costs 
additional factors in the change in cash from operations include a swing of million in environmental and legal liabilities due to a million net reduction in those reserves in versus a net increase of million in the prior year capital spending totaled million for compared to million in for  capital expenditures are projected to increase approximately percent to percent  including spending to support the new china joint venture polymers and the new plant in brazil surfactants 
consolidated debt decreased by million during  from million to million 
as of december   the ratio of long term debt to long term debt plus shareholders equity was percent  compared to percent one year earlier 
approximately million of total company debt relates to unsecured promissory notes with maturities extending until these notes are the company s primary source of long term debt financing  and are supplemented by bank credit facilities to meet short and medium term needs 
the company maintains contractual relationships with its domestic banks that provide for revolving credit of up to million  which may be drawn upon as needed for general corporate purposes through may  under a revolving credit agreement 
at december   there were borrowings totaling million under this agreement 
the company also meets short term liquidity requirements through uncommitted domestic bank lines of credit 
the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain bank term loans and short term bank lines of credit in their respective countries to meet working capital requirements as well as to fund capital expenditure programs and acquisitions 
the company s stepan europe subsidiary completed a new euro denominated bank term loan totaling million during early  which was used to repay short term bank debt and to fund new capital spending 
as of december   the company s european subsidiaries had euro denominated term loans totaling million including current maturities 
the european subsidiaries also had short term debt totaling million under short term bank credit lines at december   with unborrowed capacity of approximately million at that date 
the company s mexican subsidiary had million of debt outstanding at december  additionally  the company s chinese joint venture has entered into a credit agreement allowing the joint venture to borrow up to million  in local currency  to finance plant construction 
as of december   there were no borrowings under this loan facility  however  the company expects this loan facility to be fully utilized during stepan company has issued a guaranty to the lender for the company s proportionate interest percent in this credit facility 
the company s loan agreements contain provisions  which  among others  require maintenance of certain financial ratios and place limitations on additional debt  investments and payment of dividends 
as of december   the company would have been out of compliance with the interest coverage test under its us loan agreements 
the company obtained amendments for these loan agreements  effective december   from all of its 
table of contents lenders 
as a result  the company was in compliance with its us loan agreements as of december   and has remained in compliance since that date 
due to lower current year earnings in europe  stepan europe has obtained agreements from its banks to waive certain required financial ratios under its bank term loans through december  the company is in compliance with the rest of its loan agreements 
the majority of cash at december   was located outside the united states 
the company anticipates that cash from operations and from committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  dividends and other planned financial commitments for the foreseeable future 
any substantial acquisitions would require additional funding 
contractual obligations at december   the company s contractual obligations  including estimated payments by period  were as follows payments due by period dollars in thousands total beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other total purchase obligations consist of raw material  utility and telecommunication service purchases made in the normal course of business 
other comprises deferred revenues that represent commitments to deliver products  expected required contributions to the company s funded defined benefit pension plans and estimated payments related to the company s unfunded defined benefit supplemental executive and outside directors pension plans 
the above table does not include million of other non current liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the non current liabilities consist of liabilities related to the company s funded defined benefit pension plans and deferred compensation plans for which payment periods can not be determined 
non current liabilities also include environmental and legal liabilities that are primarily contingent in nature see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension funding in  the company contributed million and million  respectively  to its funded us and united kingdom pension plans 
the company expects to contribute approximately million and million  respectively  to the us and united kingdom plans in payments related to the unfunded non qualified plans will approximate million in compared to million in 
table of contents letters of credit the company maintains two standby letters of credit under its workers compensation insurance agreements 
these letters of credit are renewed annually and amended to the amounts required by the insurance agreements each year 
as of december   the company had million in standby letters of credit for these agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements the securities and exchange commission requires disclosure of off balance sheet arrangements that either have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
an off balance sheet arrangement is defined as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party  under which the company has any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or an obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by  and material to  the registrant  where such entity provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with  the registrant 
as of december  and  the company did not have any of the noted off balance sheet arrangements 
environmental and legal matters the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which is typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately million for  million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
the company has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
it is the company s accounting policy to record liabilities when environmental 
table of contents assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
because reported liabilities are recorded based on estimates  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december  the company s reserve was million for legal contingencies and environmental matters compared to million at december  during  non capital cash outlays related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in for certain sites  estimates cannot be made of the total costs of compliance or the company s share of such costs  accordingly  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on future results of operations 
in the event of one or more adverse determinations in any annual or interim period  the impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations for those periods could be material 
however  based upon the company s present belief as to its relative involvement at these sites  other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in this report and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company 
see also note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company maintains deferred compensation plans 
these plans allow management to defer receipt of its bonuses and directors to defer receipt of director fees until retirement or departure from the company 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices a limited selection of mutual funds or company common stock made by the plan participants 
the company maintains at least enough company common stock in treasury to cover the equivalent number of common stock shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option  which 
table of contents periodically requires the company to purchase its common shares from the open market 
the plans allow for the compensation being deferred to grow or decline based on the results of investment options chosen by the participants 
ultimately  upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive the cash equivalent value of the investment choices they have made as of the date of plan distribution 
as a result  any appreciation in the value of stepan company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan result is additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the market price of stepan company stock or the value of the mutual funds results in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
it is these market price movements that result in the significant period to period fluctuations that impact the company s consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the company s deferred compensation liability is million  of which approximately percent represents deferred compensation tied to the performance of stepan company common stock and the remainder is tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of stepan company common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
similarly  a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will fluctuate generally in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
while these market value adjustments affect the income statement due to their impact on the company s ultimate cash liability  there is not an offsetting income statement impact from fluctuation in the asset value  as generally accepted accounting principles require unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities be recorded as a direct adjustment to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
dividends and capital gains received from the mutual funds  as well as impairment losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss under the other  net caption of the consolidated statements of income 
since the stepan company common stock is held as treasury stock  no further adjustments are made to equity as a result of market price movements in the stock 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this management s discussion and analysis for discussion of the company s reserves and range of loss estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
the company believes recognition of revenue upon shipment is the appropriate point of revenue recognition as the company has no further performance obligations to the customer other than in connection with customer volume discount programs 
volume discounts due customers are estimated based on the terms of the customer contracts and related shipment information and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and are reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
customer contracts are generally annual in nature 
depending upon demand  the annual contract program provisions and the mix of customers  the company s allowance for volume discounts will fluctuate from period to period 
for arrangements where the company consigns product to a customer location  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory
