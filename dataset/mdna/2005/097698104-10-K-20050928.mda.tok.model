please refer to the note regarding forward looking statements section of this form k 
overview sales of the company s geophysical products are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
during fiscal  despite high oil and gas prices  the energy industry became increasingly cautious on marine seismic exploration spending  causing an industry wide slowdown in marine seismic activity 
due to this slowdown  marine seismic contractors significantly reduced the size of their fleets which  in turn  resulted in lower sales of geophysical equipment  including the company s air guns and underwater connectors 
marine seismic exploration started to improve during fiscal  and this improvement has continued throughout fiscal the continuing high price of oil  increased worldwide energy demand and the depletion of proven oil and natural gas reserves has caused an increased demand for marine seismic surveys 
as a result  geophysical equipment sales increased for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  based on the level of scheduled shipments and customer inquiries  the company anticipates that this improvement will continue into fiscal sales in the industrial products segment increased by for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  with continuing improvement in the us economy  the company anticipates that industrial products sales should increase in fiscal due primarily to the increase in the geophysical equipment business as described above  the company s balance sheet continued to strengthen in fiscal working capital at june  increased by from working capital at june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances and projected cash flow from operations are adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs 
year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased by  cash flow from operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was  for the year ended june   primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and deferred income taxes and higher current liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories 
for the year ended june   the company used  for capital expenditures funded from operating cash flow 
of this amount   relates to the company s exercise of the option to purchase the land and building in cypress  texas used by a g 
the remainder of the capital expenditures relates to equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately  the company expects to fund these capital expenditures from operating cash flow 
since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s geophysical equipment sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers 
at june  and  the five customers with the highest balances due represented and  respectively  of the accounts receivable balances on those dates 
in october  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the company was authorized to buy up to  shares of its common stock in open market or private transactions 
although the program remains authorized  the company has not repurchased any shares and currently has no plan to make repurchases 
year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased by  cash flow from operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was  for the year ended june   primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and deferred income taxes partially offset by higher accounts receivable 
for the year ended june   the company used  for capital expenditures funded from operating cash flow 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in addition  the company does not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or any special purpose entities and has not issued any guarantees 
contractual obligations the company had no long term borrowings  capital leases  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities at june  and the company is obligated for minimum lease payments as of june  under several operating leases for its facilities as follows contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations such amounts are exclusive of any additional rent for taxes  utilities or similar charges  under triple net leases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under lease commitments for further information regarding future payments and other information relating to such leases 
securities and exchange commission informal inquiry by letter dated january   the company was informed that the staff of the securities and exchange commission the staff had begun an informal inquiry regarding certain corporate and accounting matters 
in its letter  the staff stated that the inquiry should not be construed to indicate that any federal securities laws had been violated or to reflect on the integrity of any person  the company or its securities 
although the company believes that it has acted properly and legally and is voluntarily cooperating with the staff s informal inquiry  it can neither predict the length  scope or results of the informal inquiry  or the impact  if any  on its operations 
the company has complied with the information requests of the staff 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment increased by  or due primarily to higher a air gun system sales  b sales of air gun replacement parts  and c sales of underwater electrical connectors 
industrial products sales for the year ended june  increased by  or compared to the year ended june   reflecting higher volume associated with improvement in the domestic economy 
consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the year ended june  versus for the year ended june  cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the geophysical segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   due primarily to a higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase  b a smaller addition to the inventory valuation reserve in fiscal  and c the implementation of a price increase in january cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the industrial products segment was for the year ended june   unchanged from the year ended june  although manufacturing costs increased in the industrial products segment  such increase was offset by a price increase effective january and higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase in fiscal research and development r d costs for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  the major portion of the r d cost increase relates to the company s seismic source monitoring system ssms 
ssms is utilized to measure air gun depth  air pressure and near field energy output for each gun array  enhancing the accuracy and therefore the usefulness of marine seismic survey data 
the company is currently working on more advanced stages of ssms that will deliver further benefits to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or for the year ended june  from the year ended june  due primarily to higher a compensation expense  b professional fees  c advertising and trade show expenses  and d bad debt expense 
the company conducted  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  an annual impairment test of goodwill balances as of july  and the results of these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the june  and goodwill balances 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of  which was the same as the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses  fully offset by exempt income relating to foreign sales 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of  which was higher than the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses  partially offset by exempt income relating to foreign sales 
the above mentioned factors resulted in a net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales for the year ended june  increased by  or  from the year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment increased by  or  primarily due to several complete energy source systems sales of traditional guns which amounted to  and the first sale of the company s annular port guns which amounted to  the remainder of the increase was attributable to higher sales of air gun replacement parts and underwater electrical connectors reflecting increased marine seismic activity 
in contrast  sales of complete energy source systems sales during year ended june  amounted to only  industrial products sales for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june   primarily reflecting higher volume associated with the gradual improvement in the domestic economy and the addition of new customers 
consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the year ended june  versus for the year ended june  cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the geophysical segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   due primarily to higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve in fiscal and were  and  respectively 
these amounts were charged to cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the industrial products segment increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   due primarily to higher compensation costs 
research and development expense in fiscal was  more than in the prior fiscal year  reflecting work on the development of a new product  the ssms  and a reduction in spending on the annular port gun project 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or for the year ended june  versus the year ended june   primarily due to increased bad debt expense  and higher professional fees 
higher professional fees relate primarily to costs associated with the securities and exchange commission s informal inquiry 
the company conducted  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  an annual impairment test of goodwill balances as of july  and the results of these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the june  and goodwill balances 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of  which was higher than the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses  partially offset by exempt income relating to foreign sales 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was a benefit of  reflecting a loss before income taxes of  and an increase in net deferred tax assets partially offset by state income taxes 
the above mentioned factors resulted in a net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net loss of  for the year ended june  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include revenue recognition  recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill 
these policies are discussed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  including the establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or that it is less likely that they would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenue recognition was previously considered a key accounting policy but not a critical accounting policy 
the company  however  has concluded that it is appropriate to categorize revenue recognition as a critical accounting policy because recent foreign customer transactions have required the exercise of considerable subjective judgment 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  these are based upon information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned 
the company s reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria manufacturing products based on customer specifications 
delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period  whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer 
establishing a set sales price with the customer 
collecting the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured 
no significant contingencies exist 
inventory reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts  management establishes an inventory valuation reserve 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management 
the actual results may differ from this estimate  and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
at june  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost  less an estimate for scrap value 
in many instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
at june   the cost of inventory which has more than a five year supply on hand and the cost of inventory which has had no sales during the last five years amounted to approximately  management nevertheless believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a current cash charge since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 
the company records increases in inventory valuation reserves in cost of sales and decreases in inventory valuation reserves when items are scrapped or disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve was increased by  in addition  during fiscal the company scrapped or disposed of items which had a cost of  the inventory valuation reserve balance and activity information is presented in schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for fiscal years  and deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and  because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset 
net deferred tax assets decreased by  from  at june  to  at june  reflecting principally the utilization of the alternative minimum tax credit carry forward  utilization of the tax loss carry forward  and amortization of goodwill for tax purposes  partially offset by an increase in the inventory valuation reserve of goodwill impairment testing as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of july   the initial test  and as of each july thereafter through july  all five tests were conducted by management with the assistance of an independent valuation company  and the results of such tests indicated no impairment 
the company s goodwill carrying amounts relate solely to the acquisition of custom products and a g  which are two sfas reporting units 
bolt  the parent of custom products and a g  is a third reporting unit and has no goodwill 
both bolt and a g are in the geophysical equipment segment  and custom products is in the industrial products segment 
step one of the goodwill impairment test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount that a willing party would pay to buy or sell the unit other than in a forced liquidation sale 
the carrying amount of a reporting unit is total assets  including goodwill  minus total liabilities 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value  the company considers goodwill not to be impaired 
if the fair value is below the carrying value  the company would proceed to the next step  which is to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
any such impairment loss would be recognized in the company s results of operations in the period in which the impairment loss arose 
the company s method of determining the fair value of the custom and a g reporting units is to obtain from the valuation company an estimate of the fair value of these reporting units based on up to three different valuation approaches a a capitalized cash flow method  b a market approach that gives consideration to the prices paid for publicly traded stocks  and c a projected net income approach that examines the projected net income of certain publicly traded stocks and determines a multiple of earnings that the valuation specialist believes should be applied to the business unit s estimated earnings 
the company reviewed the estimated fair values utilizing each of the above approaches  and in each of the five annual tests performed  utilized the discounted cash flow method when reviewing for impairment 
the results of the other methods were also generally consistent with the company s conclusion that goodwill was not impaired 
the company also compared the values from the above approaches to the market capitalization of the company including the bolt unit that has no goodwill reflected in the financial statements to provide an overall test to ascertain the reasonableness of the approach used 
at all annual impairment test dates except july   the company s market capitalization exceeded the carrying value of stockholders equity at the impairment test date 
at july   the company s market capitalization was less than the company s stockholders equity  however this condition was reversed by august when the market price of the company s stock increased 
goodwill represents approximately of the company s total assets at june   and is thus a significant estimate made by management 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a current cash charge because the company s goodwill amounts reflected on its balance sheet arose out of acquisition accounting several years ago

recent accounting developments accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires that voluntary changes in accounting principle be applied retrospectively to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in the income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new principle be applied prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
apb required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas also applies to changes in accounting principle required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
if the pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
sfas requires that retrospective application be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as the impact on a profit sharing contribution or bonus  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas requires that a change in depreciation or amortization of long lived assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas leaves unchanged many of the requirements of apb  including those relating to the reporting of a change in accounting estimate  a change in the reporting entity and the correction of an error 
in addition  sfas leaves unchanged the requirements of sfas relating to the reporting of accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is allowed for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date of the statement 
the provisions of sfas will have an impact on the company s financial statements in the future should there be voluntary changes in accounting principles 
conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which is an interpretation of sfas statement no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin requires that an entity recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
if the fair value of such liability can be reasonably estimated  such liability should be recognized when incurred  which is generally upon acquisition  construction  development or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing of the conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  and december  for calendar year entities 
the company believes that fin will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the company does not engage in conditional asset retirement obligations 
share based payment in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas revised 
sfas revised is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas revised also supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the approach in sfas revised is similar in most respects to the approach described in sfas a key requirement of sfas revised is that all share based payments to employees  including stock option grants  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of the cost of employee share payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas revised is effective in the first interim period or annual reporting period beginning after june  the company believes that sfas revised will currently have no impact to the company s consolidated financial statements because under the terms of the company s existing stock option plan  no options can be granted subsequent to june  and all options were fully vested as of june  should the company provide share based payments in the future  however  the company will have to fair value these awards and recognize this cost in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of sfas revised 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas is an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb 
the guidance in apb is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
apb  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets which should be based on the recorded amount of assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the foregoing narrow exception and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the company are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges consummated in fiscal periods beginning after june  sfas will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the company does not engage in nonmonetary asset exchanges 
inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  by providing clarification on the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  stipulated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires that these items be handled as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
sfas also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that the adoption of this standard will have no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because it is already in compliance with this new standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
