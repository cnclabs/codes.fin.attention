item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in part iv  item of notes to consolidated financial statements  of this form k  which information is incorporated by reference into this part i  item pay tv group industry overview new frontier media  through its wholly owned subsidiary ten also referred to as pay tv group  is focused on the distribution of adult entertainment programming through electronic distribution platforms including cable television  dbs  hotels and c band 
adult entertainment content distribution has evolved over the past twenty five years from home video platforms video cassette to cable television systems and dbs providers  and most recently to the internet 
cable television operators began offering subscription and ppv adult programming from network providers such as playboy enterprises  inc playboy in the early s 
conditional access technology enables cable television operators or satellite providers to sell content as ppv ie  individual movie  a timed block of programming  or as an event for a set fee 
in addition  it also permits cable television operators or satellite providers to sell the pay tv group s programming on a monthly  quarterly  semiannual and annual basis 
ppv and vod programming competes well with other forms of entertainment because of its relatively low price point 
kagan world media kagan estimates that adult ppv and vod revenue generated by cable systems and dbs providers in was million 
as more cable operators add adult and distributors continue to expand their offerings  kagan projects revenues from the adult category will grow to billion by the year ppv programming is delivered through any number of delivery methods  including a cable television  b dth to households with large satellite dishes receiving a low power analog or digital signal c band or dbs services such as those currently offered by echostar communications corporation and directv group  inc  c wireless cable systems  and d low speed dial up or broadband internet connections ie  streaming video 
the pay tv group provides programming on both a ppv and subscription basis to home satellite dish viewers through large backyard satellite dishes receiving a low power analog or digital signal c band 
according to general instrument corporation s gi access control center reports  the us c band market has declined year over year  from  households as of april to  as of april the pay tv group also provides ppv and subscription programming to small dish viewers receiving a high power digital signal via dbs providers such as echostar communications corporation s dish network 
as of march   echostar communications corporation dish and directv group  inc directv had million and million subscribers  respectively  according to public filings made by each company 
kagan estimates that the number of dbs subscribers will grow to million by the year in addition  the pay tv group provides its programming on a ppv  subscription and vod basis through large multiple system operators msos and their affiliated cable systems  as well as independent  privately held cable systems 
as of april  the pay tv group maintained distribution arrangements with nine of the ten largest domestic cable msos that control access to million  or  of the total basic cable household market 
according to the national cable and telecommunications association ncta  cable msos delivered service to million basic households in the united states as of february the most recent statistics available 
in addition  kagan indicates that as of december  total analog and digital addressable cable service ie  basic cable households that have the capability of receiving ppv or subscription services was provided to million households 
growth in the ppv market is expected to result in part from cable system upgrades utilizing fiber optic  digital compression technologies or other bandwidth expansion methods that provide cable operators additional channel capacity 
cable operators have shifted from analog to digital technology in order to upgrade their cable systems and to respond to competition from dbs providers who offer programming in a digital environment 
when implemented  digital compression technology increases channel capacity  improves audio and video quality  provides fully secure scrambled signals  allows for advanced set top boxes for increased interactivity  and provides for integrated electronic programming guides epg 
the pay tv group expects that all of its future cable launches will be on a digital platform 
according to the ncta  as of december  over of us cable customers  or approximately million households  received digital cable service 
this represents an increase of over the number of digital subscribers receiving service at the end of million 
kagan estimates that the number of digital cable subscribers will grow to million by the year  which will represent an digital penetration rate 
cable operators are also using their upgraded plants to provide their digital customers with vod services due to technology constraints  dbs providers are not able to provide vod service to their customers at this time 
vod is a more advanced form of pay per view service which provides a digital video subscriber with the ability to watch movies  tv shows  infomercials  and other content on demand with full vcr functionality  in contrast to watching programs at preset times 
the pay tv group currently provides programming to over million vod enabled households 
kagan estimates that there were million vod enabled households at the end of  compared to only million vod enabled households at the end of kagan projects that there will be million vod enabled households by the end of description of networks the pay tv group provides seven  hour per day adult programming networks pleasure  ten  ten clips  ten blue  ten blox  ten xtsy  and ten max 
the following table outlines the current distribution environment for each service table summary of networks estimated network households in thousands network distribution method as of march  as of march  as of march  pleasure cable   ten cable dbs   ten clips cable dbs   video on demand cable  ten xtsy c band cable dbs  ten blueplus c band cable n a n a ten max c band cable ten blue cable   ten blox cable   total network households   ten xtsy  ten blueplus and ten max addressable household numbers include million  million  and million c band addressable households for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the pay tv group discontinued providing its ten blueplus network in february the above table reflects network household distribution 
a household will be counted more than once if the home has access to more than one of the pay tv group s services  since each service represents an incremental revenue stream 
the pay tv group estimates its unique household distribution as of march  and to be million and million cable homes  respectively  and million and million dbs homes  respectively 
ten family of networks programming strategy the ten family of networks is designed to be offered together as one cohesive programming package 
the counter programming strategy employed between each of the seven ppv networks and vod service provides the widest variety of content to the consumer while at the same time supporting an efficient use of ten s vast content library 
premiere titles are programmed on vod first and then flow through to the ppv networks 
because ten does not duplicate titles across its ppv channels or between ppv and vod in a single month  ten is able to give its consumers access to more unique titles  a wider variety of talent  and a greater variety of studio representation than any of its competitors 
ten focuses on prime time viewing blocks and programs specific types of content in those blocks to create an appointment viewing calendar with the intent of driving viewers to traditionally less popular nights of the week for viewing adult content 
all networks are counter programmed to one another  creating an even greater level of variety for the consumer with multiple channels 
ultimately  this strategy is responsible for the fact that ten has services per unique addressable home 
following are individual descriptions of each network 
pleasure on june   the pay tv group launched pleasure  a hour per day adult network that incorporates the most edited standard available in the category 
pleasure is distributed via cable television operators 
pleasure s programming consists of adult feature length film and video productions and is programmed to deliver subscription and ppv households up to monthly premiere adult movies with a total of up to adult movies per month 
pleasure was specifically designed to provide adult content programming to operators that have not yet embraced a less inhibited adult programming philosophy and for those operators that wish to use the service to upsell subscription or ppv households to a less edited network such as ten or ten clips 
pleasure is distributed via cable system operators on either a pay per view or pay per block basis at prices ranging from to ten on august   the pay tv group launched ten  a hour per day adult network that incorporates a partial editing standard targeted to cable television system operators and dbs providers

ten was developed to capitalize on the number of cable operators dbs providers now willing to carry partially edited adult network services and the momentum toward broader market acceptance of partially edited adult programming by their subscribers 
new frontier media believes the growing market acceptance of partially edited programming is due  in large part  to the higher buy rates the theoretical percentage of network households ordering one ppv movie  program or event in a month achieved for cable system operators dbs providers as compared to network programming that incorporates the most edited adult programming 
ten clips the pay tv group launched ten clips on may  the unique formatting of this network provides for thematically organized clips that are compiled into minute blocks of programming in order to provide more variety in a single viewing block and encourage appointment viewing by the ppv adult consumer 
through the pay tv group s proprietary database technology  approximately eight scenes are organized thematically and programmed into one minute block 
ten clips delivers unique thematic blocks with over different adult film scenes during a typical month 
this clips format is the most differentiated service in the adult category and consistently generates higher buy rates than feature driven adult services 
ten clips is distributed via cable system operators and dbs providers on a pay per view and pay per block basis at retail prices ranging from to and on a monthly subscription basis for 
ten blue ten blue was launched on january  as the pay tv group s newest  partially edited network

additionally  ten blox was designed specifically to achieve broader market acceptance by appealing to people with different ethnic backgrounds and interests 
ten blox is distributed via cable system operators on a pay per view or pay per block basis at retail prices ranging from to 
ten on demand video on demand ten on demand is the brand under which the pay tv group delivers its vod service 
this service is available to cable operators in each of the pay tv group s three editing standards 
ten provides a standard content package of titles in addition to several title add on packages of specialized content 
content is refreshed on a monthly basis and provides for a day early release window to the ppv services 
accordingly  there is no duplication of content between the ppv networks and the vod content in any one month 
most cable mso s are currently accepting to hours of ten on demand content 
ten on demand is distributed via cable operators on a per movie basis at retail prices ranging from to 
in addition  the pay tv group provides its ten on demand service to on command corporation on command  the leading provider of in room interactive entertainment for the hotel industry and its guests

cable operators and dbs providers distribute ten xtsy on a pay per view or pay per block basis at retail prices ranging from to and on a monthly subscription basis for 
ten xtsy had   and  active c band subscriptions as of march   and  respectively 
c band retail prices range from to for monthly and quarterly subscriptions 
ten blueplus ten blueplus was primarily provided to the c band dth market 
given the continued decline in the number of addressable households in the c band market and the continued decline in the pay tv group s revenue from this market  the pay tv group made the decision to discontinue this service in february ten max ten max incorporates the same editing standard as ten xtsy and is programmed to compliment this network by utilizing thematically organized clips similar to the ten clips format from ten xtsy s premieres  network specials and compilations 
ten max is distributed via c band dth and cable operators 
c band retail prices range from to for monthly and quarterly subscriptions 
ten max had   and  active c band subscriptions as of march    and  respectively 
satellite transmission the pay tv group delivers its video programming via satellite transmission 
satellite delivery of video programming is accomplished as follows video programming is played directly from the pay tv group s boulder  colorado digital broadcast center 
the program signal is then scrambled encrypted so that the signal is unintelligible unless it is passed through the proper preauthorized decoding devices 
the signal is transmitted uplinked by an earth station to a designated transponder on a communications satellite 
the transponder receives the program signal uplinked by the earth station  amplifies the program signal and broadcasts downlinks it to satellite dishes located within the satellite s area of signal coverage 
the signal coverage of the domestic satellite used by new frontier media is the continental united states  hawaii  alaska  and portions of the caribbean  mexico  and canada 
the pay tv group s programming is received by c band subscribers  cable system operators and dbs providers 
this programming is received in the form of a scrambled signal 
in order for subscribers to receive the programming the signal must be unscrambled 
c band subscribers purchase programming directly from the pay tv group 
the satellite receivers of c band subscribers contain unscrambling equipment that may be authorized to decode the pay tv group s satellite services 
each set top box or satellite receiver has a unique electronic address 
this address is activated for the requisite services purchased 
cable system operators and dbs providers receive their programming in the same manner as a c band subscriber 
these multi channel distributors in turn  provide the received programming to their captive subscriber audience 
the equipment utilized by cable system operators and dbs providers is similar to that utilized by c band subscribers but manufactured to an industrial grade specification 
the cable system operators and dbs providers are able to remotely control each subscriber s set top box or satellite receiver on their network  and cause it to unscramble the television signal for a specified period of time after the subscriber has made a purchase of a premium service or ppv vod movie or event 
transponder and vod transport agreements new frontier media maintains satellite transponder lease agreements for two full time analog transponders with intelsat usa sales corporation intelsat on its intelsat americas satellite and mhz of total bandwidth allocation on a digital transponder on its intelsat americas satellite 
these transponders provide the satellite transmission necessary to broadcast each of the pay tv group s seven adult networks

cmc is a business unit of comcast cable  which is a division of comcast corporation comcast 
cmc encodes and delivers content to headends currently serving comcast s vod enabled cable systems 
the cmc vod platform helps to optimize resources at the local level by providing operators the ability to centrally manage the delivery and quality control of on demand content

digital broadcast center the pay tv group internally encodes  originates  distributes and manages its own networks 
the company has differentiated itself by developing broadcast and broadband distribution capabilities to fully control and exploit its large content library across various platforms 
the pay tv group acquired the necessary broadcast technologies and support services from third party providers  and internally developed its own media asset management systems  for the distribution of video based content to cable and dbs providers 
the pay tv group  through its boulder  colorado based digital broadcast center  currently broadcasts channels  with capacity to add additional channels  to cable dbs systems and direct to home c band subscribers 
broadcast of all media to air is accomplished using state of the art digital technology solutions  which includes playlist automation for all channels  seachange mpeg encoding and playout to air and mpeg encoding for broadband use  a storage area network for near line content movement and storage  archiving capability on dlt data cartridges  and complete integration of its media asset management database for playlist automation and program scheduling 
the pay tv group has worked with its uplinking vendor  wiltel communications  llc wiltel to secure a license to allow an ghz microwave transmission in order to provide a fully redundant path from the broadcast center to its uplink facility 
the technology team that manages the broadcast center also oversees the pay tv group s media asset management needs 
using its own core proprietary asset management systems  supplemented with other third party software programs  the digital broadcast center catalogs  monitors  and distributes the group s licensed content across multiple technology platforms 
network programming prior to may  the pay tv group had contracted with an outside third party in california to screen  license  edit  and program content for most of its services 
at the same time  the pay tv group edited and programmed content in house for ten blue  ten blox  ten clips  ten max and the on command vod content 
in may  the pay tv group discontinued its relationship with the outside third party in california and brought all screening  licensing  editing and programming functions in house 
the pay tv group now has its own office in california 
this office ensures that all legal documentation is obtained for each title licensed ie  cast lists  talent releases and two photo identifications for each cast member  screens the content to ensure the commercial and broadcast viability of the title  and  once the title is deemed acceptable  ships the title  related documentation and promotional content to boulder

the pay tv group acquires of its feature length broadcast programming for each network by licensing the exclusive and non exclusive rights from over forty five third party studios and independent producers within the industry for generally a five year term 
the group does not produce any of its own adult feature content for its networks 
the pay tv group acquires approximately premiere titles per month 
in addition  the pay tv group may license library content on an as needed basis 
library content are titles that have generally been produced within the last three years but have never been broadcast on a cable television or dbs platform 
once the pay tv group licenses a title  it will undergo several rigorous quality control processes prior to playing to air to ensure compliance with the strict broadcasting standards the pay tv group uses for its adult content 
the pay tv group obtains age verification documentation for each title it licenses  including two forms of photo identification for each cast member in the film 
this documentation is maintained on site for the duration of the license term 
in july  the company licensed the rights for seven years to metro global media  inc s metro  title adult film and video library and multi million still image archive in exchange for  shares of its common stock at per share and  warrants to purchase its common stock at an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock on the date the warrants were issued 
in june  new frontier media reached an agreement to license all of the broadcast and electronic distribution rights to approximately  adult films under a content license agreement with pleasure productions  inc call center service the pay tv group s in house call center receives incoming calls from customers wishing to order c band network programming  or having questions about their c band service or billing 
the call center is accessible from anywhere in the us via toll free numbers 
its workstations are equipped with a networked computer  company owned proprietary order processing software  and telephone equipment 
these components are tied into a computer telephony integrated switch which routes incoming calls and enables orders to be processed and subscriber information to be updated on line 
the pay tv group s call center is operational hours per day  seven days a week  and is staffed according to call traffic patterns  which take into account time of day  day of the week  seasonal variances  holidays  and special promotions 
customers pay for their order with credit cards and electronic checks  which are authorized and charged before the order is sent electronically to gi s access control center in san diego  california for processing 
gi receives the subscriber order and the subscriber s identification information  and sends a signal to the appropriate satellite  which unlocks the service ordered for the applicable period of time 
marketing the pay tv group s marketing department has developed numerous programs and promotions to support its pay per view and vod services 
these include the development of detailed monthly program guides  promotional pieces  direct mail campaigns  and cross channel interstitial programming for use on a cable or dbs systems channel that allows for local insertion 
the pay tv group also maintains a sales force of five full time employees to promote and sell carriage of its programming on cable television  dbs and alternative platforms 
the sales force consists of cable television industry veterans that each has more than ten years of experience in the cable television business in both operations and programming 
the pay tv group s sales team attends at least three major industry trade shows per year  including the national cable television association ncta show  dish summit  and the cable television advertising and marketing ctam summit  along with various local trade shows 
the pay tv group s promotions department creates interstitial programming for use on its networks between each movie to promote and market additional movies premiering in the current month  movies premiering in the following month  behind the scenes segments of its movies  and star and director profiles 
this interstitial programming encourages appointment viewing of the pay tv group s networks by cable dbs consumers 
the pay tv group brands its services to the consumer under the ten name and logo 
the pay tv group seeks out low cost  high impact ways to reach its consumer audience and build brand recognition 
competition the pay tv group principally competes with playboy enterprises  inc playboy in the subscription  ppv and vod markets 
playboy has a longer operating history and broader name recognition than the pay tv group 
playboy s size and market position makes it a more formidable competitor than if it did not have the resources and name recognition that it has 
the pay tv group competes directly with playboy with respect to the editing standards of its programming  network performance in terms of subscriber buy rates  and the license fees that the pay tv group offers to cable operators and dbs providers 
however  the pay tv group cannot and does not compete with playboy in the amount of money spent on programming and promoting its products 
while there can be no assurance that the pay tv group will be able to maintain its current distribution and fee structures in the face of competition from playboy or any other content provider  the pay tv group believes that the quality and variety of its programming  as well as the attractive revenue splits and its ability to generate higher buy rates for its programming  are the critical factors which have influenced cable operators and dbs providers to choose the pay tv group s programming over its competition 
the pay tv group also faces general competition from other forms of non adult entertainment  including sporting and cultural events  other television networks  feature films  and other programming 
in addition  the pay tv group faces competition in the adult entertainment arena from other providers of adult programming including producers of adult content  adult video dvd rentals and sales  books and magazines aimed at adult consumers  telephone adult chat lines  adult oriented internet services and adult oriented wireless services 
seasonality the pay tv group s business is generally not seasonal in nature 
customer concentration new frontier media derived   and of its total revenue for the year ended march  from dish  time warner cable and comcast corporation  respectively  through its pay tv group 
the loss of any of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on the pay tv segment and upon the company as a whole 
internet group industry overview according to pew internet american life pew  a non profit entity whose initiative is the timely information on the internet s growth and societal impact  nearly million american adults have high speed connections in the home and of the online population in the us is made up of adults age or older 
pew also cites data that shows that americans are behind in comparison to other parts of the world with respect to broadband penetration 
according to the most recent data from the federal communications commission  in south korea ranked first in the world in broadband penetration with of its citizens having a broadband connection at home  hong kong was second with  canada was third with  and the united states was eleventh with 
according to ncta  the us cable industry served approximately million high speed internet customers as of december  up from million in december  an increase of year over year 
according to jupiter research  a leading research advisory organization  million us households have broadband access 
this is predicted to grow to million households  or of online households  by in anticipation of the continued increase in broadband users  during the fiscal year ended march  the internet group shifted its focus from the dial up web surfer to creating an award winning website targeted specifically to the broadband consumer 
this site  ten 
com  features over  hours of video content  over  photos  live chat  and voyeur cams 
ten 
com is offered to consumers on a monthly subscription basis for or a three month subscription for 
traffic to ten 
com is derived from advertising on the pay tv group s networks 
in addition  a targeted network of affiliated adult webmasters directs traffic to ten 
com and is compensated only if the traffic converts into a paying member to ten 
com 
monthly subscription revenue declined during the fiscal year ended march   as the internet group was not attracting enough new traffic to ten 
com to offset the churn of its recurring membership base 
the internet group also sells ten 
com through revenue sharing partnerships with third party gatekeepers 
the internet group executed its first such revenue sharing agreement with on command during the fiscal year ended march  under the terms of the agreement  the internet group is the exclusive provider of adult content for on command s tv internet service 
the internet group is providing a customized version of its ten 
com broadband product for delivery through on command s tv internet service in its hotel rooms nationwide 
during the fiscal year  the internet group will be focused on the development of a wireless product for distribution both domestically and internationally 
based on a february  press release  juniper research  an entity that provides analytical research reports and consultancy services to the telecommunications industry  is predicting the following with respect to the mobile adult content market a the value of mobile adult content will increase by more than to billion in  b this growth will come from video clips and streaming video  c the majority of revenues will be derived from europe and the asia pacific region  and d north american mobile adult revenues will pass the million mark by the end of the decade 
in addition  this same press release stated that a the value of the global mobile adult market will reach billion by  b the scale of content available directly from operators in the uk and mainland europe will likely rise dramatically in the short and medium term  c more than half the net additions to the user base of adult text based services will come from asia  and d european customers are currently the biggest spenders on adult content  with an average annual revenue per user of more than juniper research also suggests that the us market size will initially be limited because the wireless operators are reluctant to offer this type of content for fear of regulatory or consumer backlash 
however  wireless customers in the us will still be able to access this content by browsing wireless internet sites  such as the one that our internet group has developed over the past several months 
according to ctia  the wireless trade association  the number of wireless subscribers in the us has increased since to approximately million 
the wireless product currently being developed will include a wireless enabled web site  photo and video content  and ring moans 
the product will be sold on a subscription and a la carte basis 
product pricing and revenue sharing agreements with the carriers are still being developed 
launches for the wireless product are anticipated to occur in the us  south america and europe within the next three to six months 
the internet group will also be working to develop interactive adult games for distribution on cable  dbs and hotel platforms during the fiscal year 
description of internet revenue streams business to consumer ten 
com the internet group offers ten 
com to consumers on a recurring monthly subscription basis for or for three months at 
the site is targeted to adult broadband consumers and provides access to over  hours of video content 
the internet group generates traffic to its web sites through two primary sources 
the first  type in traffic  is generated when a consumer types the name of the internet group s web site into their browser address bar 
there is no cost to the internet group when traffic comes to its web site in this manner 
currently  the internet group actively markets its ten 
com web site on the pay tv group s networks in order to drive type in traffic to its site 
approximately of the internet group s traffic is currently generated from advertising on the pay tv group s networks or through type in traffic 
the second way in which the internet group generates traffic is through its affiliate marketing programs utilizing banner ads  hypertext  or graphic links 
the marketing programs compensate an affiliated webmaster for a referred visitor if the visitor becomes a member to ten 
com 
the affiliated webmaster programs currently pay out an amount equal to of the first month s membership revenue for a new member 
the internet group then keeps of the revenue from each recurring monthly membership 
during the past few years  the internet group has decreased its reliance on affiliated webmaster programs as a way to generate traffic to its sites 
business to business content and traffic sales content sales the internet and pay tv groups have licensed thousands of hours of adult video content and over  still images from various adult studios  all of which have been organized thematically and  if necessary  digitized for internet distribution 
the internet group  in addition to using this content within its own web site  sublicenses this content to webmasters through its business to business programs on a flat rate monthly basis 
traffic sales the internet group had developed a significant source of revenue by selling traffic from its own web site to other adult web sites 
since every visitor to the internet group s web site does not necessarily purchase a membership  the internet group maximized its return on traffic by pushing these exiting non member visitors to other adult web sites 
in doing so  it was able to generate revenue from affiliate webmaster programs on a pay per member basis 
while the revenue from the sale of traffic did not have the potential to generate long term recurring revenue like the internet group s membership revenue  it also did not have the credit and working capital issues associated with membership revenue 
because the internet group has seen a significant decline in traffic to its site  it also has seen a corresponding decrease in the amount of traffic available to resell 
the internet group does not expect any significant revenue from traffic sales in the future 
marketing the internet group currently generates approximately of its traffic to ten 
com from advertising its site on the pay tv group s networks and through type in traffic 
prior to the fiscal year ended march   the internet group actively marketed its websites through affiliate webmaster programs which were incentive based traffic generation programs that compensated affiliated webmasters for traffic referrals 
during the fiscal year ended march   the internet group ceased actively marketing its traffic acquisition programs 
currently  the internet group has a small group of affiliated webmasters that send traffic to ten 
com and are compensated if the traffic converts into a paying member 
the affiliate webmaster programs currently pay out an amount equal to of the first month s membership revenue for a new member 
the internet group then keeps of the revenue from each recurring monthly membership 
data center the internet group had its own data center in sherman oaks  california that provided for all of its web farm  hosting and co location needs 
the data center occupied approximately  square feet 
the internet group moved its data center to boulder  colorado in january where it has been integrated with the pay tv group s digital broadcast facility 
this move allowed the internet group to significantly reduce its data center costs 
integrating the data center with the broadcast facility enables the company to more efficiently leverage its content across multiple platforms 
the data center uses leading networking hardware  high end web and database servers  and computer software to effectively address the internet group s diverse systems and network integration needs 
e commerce billing historically  credit card purchases  primarily through visa and mastercard  have been face to face paper transactions 
this has evolved into face to face swipe transactions with the advent of point of sale terminals and a magnetic stripe on the back of the card storing the cardholder s information 
the credit card system  however  was never designed for non face to face transactions such as those that occur on the internet 
because the credit card system was not designed for non face to face transactions  it is understandable that most fraud originates in this area 
the credit card networks were not engineered to verify a valid card in a card not present environment such as the internet 
the card associations  instead of investing in modifications of its legacy networks necessary to operate in this changing environment  have combated fraud in card not present environments by charging high chargeback fees and penalties to merchants and banks 
in the past few years the number of banking relationships available for merchant banking has dropped  the cost of chargebacks has increased  and the acceptable level allowed for chargeback rates has also been dramatically reduced 
the internet group utilizes one credit card company to process its membership revenue from ten 
com and maintains chargeback and credit ratios that are well below the requirement 
competition the adult internet industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented given the relatively low barriers to entry 
the leading adult internet companies are constantly vying for more members while also seeking to hold down member acquisition costs paid to webmasters 
increased tightening of chargebacks by credit card companies has reduced membership sales and further intensified this already competitive environment 
the internet group believes that the primary competitive factors in the adult internet industry include the quality of content  technology  pricing  and sales and marketing efforts 
although the internet group no longer actively competes for traffic with its primary internet competitors  the group believes that it has a distinct competitive advantage in forming third party gatekeeper arrangements for the distribution of ten 
com since it already has many of the same relationships through the pay tv group s contracts 
employees as of the date of this report  new frontier media and its subsidiaries had employees

based solely on a review of such reports provided to the company and written representations from such persons regarding the necessity to file such reports  the company is not aware of any failures to file reports or report transactions in a timely manner during the company s fiscal year ended march  risk factors this report on form k contains forward looking statements 
you can identify forward looking statements by their use of the forward looking words anticipate  estimate  project  likely  believe  intend  expect  or similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections regarding future developments  operations  or financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
when considering the forward looking statements made in this report  you should consider the risks set forth below and other cautionary statements throughout this report 
you should also keep in mind that all forward looking statements are based on management s existing beliefs about present and future events outside of management s control and on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect 
if one or more risks identified in this report or other filing materializes  or any other underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated  projected  or intended 
the loss of any of our major customers  dish network  time warner cable  and comcast corporation  would have a material adverse affect on our operating performance and financial condition 
dish network  one of the leading providers of direct broadcast satellite services in the united states  time warner cable and comcast corporation  are major customers of our pay tv group 
the loss of any of dish network  time warner cable  and comcast corporation as customers would have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 
for our fiscal year ended march   our revenues from dish network  time warner cable  and comcast corporation were approximately   and  respectively  of our total company wide revenues 
dish network is not contractually required to carry our programming and can cancel its broadcast of our programming at any time 
management considers its long standing personal contacts with its counterparts at dish network to be critically important to maintaining dish network as a major customer  especially given the nature of our content and the importance of dish network s reliance on our judgment and ability in assuring that all of its programming has been pre screened and appropriately edited in accordance with established guidelines 
limits to our access to distribution channels could cause us to lose subscriber revenues and adversely affect our operating performance 
our satellite uplink provider s services are critical to us 
if our satellite uplink provider fails to provide the contracted uplinking services  our satellite programming operations would in all likelihood be suspended  resulting in a loss of substantial revenue to the company 
if our satellite uplink provider improperly manages its uplink facilities  we could experience signal disruptions and other quality problems that  if not immediately addressed  could cause us to lose subscribers and subscriber revenues 
our continued access to satellite transponders is critical to us 
our satellite programming operations require continued access to satellite transponders to transmit programming to our subscribers 
we also use satellite transponders to transmit programming to cable operators and dbs providers 
material limitations to satellite transponder capacity could materially adversely affect our operating performance 
access to transponders may be restricted or denied if we or the satellite owner is indicted or otherwise charged as a defendant in a criminal proceeding  the fcc issues an order initiating a proceeding to revoke the satellite owner s authorization to operate the satellite  the satellite owner is ordered by a court or governmental authority to deny us access to the transponder  we are deemed by a governmental authority to have violated any obscenity law  or our satellite transponder provider determines that the content of our programming is harmful to its name or business 
in addition to the above  the access of our networks to transponders may be restricted or denied if a governmental authority commences an investigation concerning the content of the transmissions 
our ability to convince cable operators and dbs providers to carry our programming is critical to us 
the primary way for us to expand our cable subscriber base is to convince additional cable operators and dbs providers to carry our programming 
we can give no assurance  however  that our efforts to increase our base of subscribers will be successful 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our primary cable dbs competitor  who has significantly greater resources than us  we will not be able to increase subscriber revenues 
our ability to increase subscriber revenues and operate profitably is directly related to our ability to compete effectively with playboy  our principal competitor 
playboy has significantly greater financial  sales  marketing and other resources to devote to the development  promotion and sale of its cable programming products  as well as a longer operating history and broader name recognition  than we do 
we compete with playboy as to the editing standards of its programming  network performance in terms of subscriber buy rates  and the license fees that we offer to cable operators and dbs providers 
failure to maintain our agreements with cable msos on favorable terms could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we currently have agreements with the nation s five largest cable msos 
our agreements with these operators may be terminated on short notice without penalty 
if one or more cable msos terminates or does not renew our agreements  or does not renew the agreement on terms as favorable as those of our current agreements  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to compete effectively with other forms of adult and non adult entertainment  we will also not be able to increase subscriber revenue 
our ability to increase revenue is also related to our ability to compete effectively with other forms of adult and non adult entertainment 
we face competition in the adult entertainment industry from other providers of adult programming  adult video rentals and sales  books and magazines aimed at adult consumers  adult oriented telephone chat lines  adult oriented internet services  and adult oriented wireless services 
to a lesser extent  we also face general competition from other forms of non adult entertainment  including sporting and cultural events  other premium pay services  other television networks  feature films and other programming 
our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the quality and appeal of our competitors content  the technology utilized by our competitors  the effectiveness of their sales and marketing efforts and the attractiveness of their product offerings 
our existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors  may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this may allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their product offerings 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive technology research and development and adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their content 
additionally  increased competition could result in price reductions  lower margins and negatively impact our financial results 
the continued addition of new competitors to the video on demand distribution platform will likely have a material adverse affect on our operating performance 
revenue from our pay tv group s video on demand vod service became a significant part of our overall revenue mix during our fiscal year ended march  the continued addition of new competitors to the vod platform  either on platforms where we have previously enjoyed exclusivity or where we currently share the platform  may continue to have an adverse affect on our operating performance 
we face competition on the vod platform from established adult video producers with post production capabilities  as well as independent companies that distribute adult entertainment 
these competitors include producers such as video company of america  hustler  vivid video  wicked pictures  and metro global media inc in the event that cable companies seek to purchase adult video content for their vod service directly from adult video producers or other independent distributors of such content  including playgirl  our vod business is likely to suffer 
for the fiscal year ended march   revenue from our vod service was of our total pay tv revenue 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the internet 
because of the adult oriented content of our web site  we may be subject to obscenity or other legal claims by third parties 
we may also be subject to claims based upon the content that is available on our web site through links to other sites 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed if we were found liable for this content 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure to this liability may require us to take steps that would substantially limit the attractiveness of our web site and or its availability in various geographic areas  which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue 
furthermore  our insurance may not adequately protect us against all of these types of claims 
increased government regulation in the united states and abroad could impede our ability to deliver our content and expand our business 
new laws or regulations  or the new application of existing laws could prevent us from making our content available in various jurisdictions or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
these new laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  taxation  user privacy and other matters relating to our products and services 
moreover  the application to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  pornography  obscenity  libel  employment and personal privacy is still developing 
cable system and dbs operators could become subject to new governmental regulations that could further restrict their ability to broadcast our programming 
if new regulations make it more difficult for cable and dbs operators to broadcast our programming  our operating performance would be adversely affected 
the current republican administration in washington dc could result in increased government regulation of our business 
it is not possible for us to predict what new governmental regulations we may be subject to in the future 
continued imposition of tighter processing restrictions by the various credit card associations and acquiring banks would make it more difficult to generate revenues from our website 
our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment for our products and services is critical to us 
unlike a merchant handling a sales transaction in a card present environment  the e commerce merchant is responsible for all fraud perpetrated against them 
our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment for our products and services has been or could further be restricted or denied for a number of reasons  including but not limited to visa tier capital ratio requirements for financial institutions have significantly restricted the level of adult related internet activity a particular bank may be allowed to process in any given month  if we experience excessive chargebacks and or credits  if we experience excessive fraud ratios  if there is a change in policy of the acquiring banks and or card associations with respect to the processing of credit card charges for adult related content  continued tightening of credit card association chargeback regulations in international areas of commerce  association requirements for new technologies that consumers are less likely to use  an increasing number of european and us banks will not take accounts with adult related content in this regard we note that american express has a policy of not processing credit card charges for online adult related content 
to the extent other credit card processing companies were to implement a similar policy it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 
if we are not able to retain our key executives it will be more difficult for us to manage our operations and our operating performance could be adversely affected 
as a small company with approximately employees  our success depends upon the contributions of our executive officers and our other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could have a significant adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we cannot assure that new frontier media will be successful in attracting and retaining these personnel 
it may also be more difficult for us to attract and recruit new personnel due to the nature of our business 
our inability to identify  fund the investment in  and commercially exploit new technology could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
we are engaged in a business that has experienced tremendous technological change over the past several years 
as a result  we face all the risks inherent in businesses that are subject to rapid technological advancement  such as the possibility that a technology that we have invested in may become obsolete 
in that event  we may be required to invest in new technology 
our inability to identify  fund the investment in  and commercially exploit such new technology could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
our ability to implement our business plan and to achieve the results projected by management will be dependent upon management s ability to predict technological advances and implement strategies to take advantage of such changes 
negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts by opponents of adult content could adversely affect our operating performance and discourage investors from investing in our publicly traded securities 
we could become a target of negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts by one or more advocacy groups who oppose the distribution of adult entertainment 
these groups have mounted negative publicity campaigns  filed lawsuits and encouraged boycotts against companies whose businesses involve adult entertainment 
the costs of defending against any such negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts could be significant  could hurt our finances and could discourage investors from investing in our publicly traded securities 
to date  we have not been a target of any of these advocacy groups 
as a leading provider of adult entertainment  we cannot assure you that we may not become a target in the future 
because we are involved in the adult programming business  it may be more difficult for us to raise money or attract market support for our stock 
some investors  investment banking entities  market makers  lenders and others in the investment community may decide not to provide financing to us  or to participate in our public market or other activities due to the nature of our business  which  in turn  may hurt the value of our stock  and our ability to attract market support

the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
our business our goal is to be the leading provider in the electronic distribution of high quality adult entertainment via cable  satellite  broadband  hotel and wireless platforms 
as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment  we use the following core competencies leveraging our technical infrastructure we own and operate a broadcast origination facility where our licensed content is a ingested at one central point and converted into multiple digital formats that allow for broadcast  vod  internet and wireless delivery  b tagged with meta data that allows for efficient cataloging of the elements included in the movie  c edited into the proper formats required by our customers ie  most edited  partially edited  and least edited  and d subjected to several rigorous quality control reviews prior to airing on any platform 
by owning and operating our own technical infrastructure  including our proprietary media asset management software tool  we are able to quickly respond to new revenue opportunities with zero to very little capital outlay 
for example  over the years  we have worked closely with many cable msos in understanding and perfecting the delivery of vod content  allowing us to become the leader in the delivery of vod content in the adult category 
we have been able to easily capitalize on new opportunities for delivering our content to the hotel industry due to our technical infrastructure 
we responded to the demand for new partially edited ppv services by launching two new networks in only days at very little additional cost 
we launched our first wireless enabled web site in two months 
we believe that our technical infrastructure will allow us to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities in the cable  satellite  broadband  hotel  and wireless markets  as well as any new platforms that may be discovered 
content library we license content from a network of over forty five different adult studios  allowing us access to a wider variety of directors  actors and actresses  and content niches than our primary competitor 
we are committed to providing our consumers with variety  breadth and depth of content in order to appeal to the widest audience base possible 
we understand that our content is purchased in an impulse environment and that in order to capture those purchases we must provide a large amount of compelling content to the consumer 
we use our extensive library to program our ppv networks  vod service  internet website  and wireless product 
content is used continuously through the life of the license term and will be repurposed in many ways  including using clips of the content and creating compilations or blocks of programming from several movies 
we spend approximately million annually licensing content for our ppv  vod  internet and wireless products 
the amount spent annually on licensing content has been relatively flat for the past four years 
expertise in aggregation and editing of adult content we consider ourselves to be experts in the aggregation and editing of high quality adult content 
we ensure that we have all proper documentation required to verify that the cast members of the movies that we license are eighteen years or older 
we have developed processes and procedures to edit our content into various predetermined standards and censor that content for community standards 
we believe that the value we provide is insuring the existence of all age verification documents and appropriate content censorship in order to protect the brand equity of our distribution partners 
we monitor the trends in the video sales and rental market to understand what content niches are popular and program our networks to correspond to these trends 
we monitor the trends of the vod buys of our own content to understand what type of content is selling the best and adjust our programming models for these trends 
we understand how to create compelling vod content packages for our customers to launch on their systems  including ten latinas  ten hunks  four play four feature length movies sold as one asset  quick n nasty  and double features 
we strive to provide the best performing ppv networks and vod service to the cable dbs hotel markets 
we program seven ppv networks in order to accommodate different editing standards and different programming niches to best serve our customers needs 
we also ensure that the interstitial programming that we create is entertaining  edgy  and appeals to our consumer audience 
reliable cash flows we consider our ability to generate reliable  recurring cash flows from operations to reinvest in our business to be a strength of our business 
we are able to reinvest these cash flows into capital expenditures to ensure that we are operating at maximum efficiency  that our broadcast operations are fully redundant  that our increasing storage needs are met  and that we are able to rapidly respond to changing technology requirements or platforms through which to distribute our products 
in addition  we are able to reinvest our cash flows into acquiring compelling  unique  quality content for our products 
we also believe that our ability to generate reliable  recurring cash flows  as well as our current cash balances  will help us with the challenges of increasing competition in the vod market and with any regulatory issues that may arise from the current conservative administration 
our people we consider our employees to be a key driver to our business 
we are fortunate to be able to attract high quality marketing  branding  sales and technology employees who share our desire to use technology to make ourselves as efficient and effective as possible  who share our desire to build a worldwide recognizable brand  and who share our desire to obtain distribution on all electronic platforms willing to distribute adult content 
we operate our company in two different segments pay tv and internet 
our core business resides within the pay tv segment and this is where the majority of our financial and human resources are concentrated 
pay tv segment our pay tv segment is focused on the distribution of its seven ppv networks and its video on demand vod service to cable msos and dbs providers 
in addition  the pay tv group has had success in delivering its vod service to hotel rooms through its current distribution arrangement with on command 
the pay tv group earns a percentage of revenue on each pay per view  subscription  or vod transaction related to its services 
revenue growth occurs as the pay tv group launches its services to new cable msos or dbs providers  experiences growth in the number of digital subscribers for systems where its services are currently distributed on line growth  launches additional services to its existing cable dbs partners  experiences new and on line growth for its vod service  is able to effect increases in the retail price of its products  and is able to increase the buy rates for its products 
the pay tv group seeks to achieve distribution for at least four of its services on every digital platform in the us based on the current market of million dbs households and million digital cable households  the pay tv group currently has of its defined market share 
revenue growth for the pay tv group for the year ended march  was driven primarily by growth in revenue from its vod service provided to the cable industry growth in the distribution of its partially edited services revenue from the pay tv group s vod service became a significant part of its overall revenue mix during the fiscal year ended march   as cable operators upgraded their systems to deliver content in this manner 
the pay tv group currently delivers its vod content to million cable network households as compared to million a year ago  as well as to  hotel rooms through its distribution arrangement with on command 
the company expects that the majority of cable operators will continue to upgrade their systems to allow for the delivery of vod content to the home 
vod can only be delivered in a digital  cable environment 
currently  per the ncta  there are million digital cable households in the us we estimate that million digital cable households are currently vod enabled and  of this amount  million provide adult content to their vod customers 
prior to our fiscal year  we were the sole provider of adult vod content to the two largest us cable msos 
during the third quarter of our fiscal year  our primary competitor in this market was added to the time warner vod adult platform 
although our primary competitor was added to this platform  it did not negatively impact the number of hours of vod content that we provide to the time warner affiliates 
in fact  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we increased the number of vod hours provided to over since our primary competitor was added to the platform  however  our vod revenue from time warner has declined 
during our fiscal year  the largest cable mso in the us will begin transitioning the editing standard on its vod platform from most edited to partially edited 
at the same time  this cable mso will add adult content provided by two smaller competitors to its vod platform 
we anticipate that our primary competitor will also be added to this mso s vod platform during our fiscal year 
at this time it is impossible for us to determine the exact effect this change will have on our revenue 
however  we do anticipate that any decline in revenue from the addition of competition will be more than offset by the increase in revenue expected from transitioning the editing standard of the content from most edited to partially edited 
we do anticipate that the addition of competition to vod platforms where we have enjoyed exclusivity in the past will slow our vod revenue growth in the short term 
however  we expect that our vod cable revenue will increase as msos a continue the deployment of this technology to their digital cable subscribers  b increase the number of digital customers annual growth of digital cable households has been per year  c increase the amount of space allocated on their vod servers to the adult category currently we provide over hours of programming each month  d begin to actively market vod to their consumer base  and e improve the consumer s user interface to make the product easier to use 
the pay tv group s relationship with on command generated incremental vod revenue for the year ended march  however  revenue from on command declined during our fiscal year 
the decline was a result of on command sourcing some content from our competitors instead of exclusively through us 
we continue to provide over of the content to the on command platform 
future growth from vod revenue generated through the hospitality industry is dependent upon the addition of new hotel properties by on command and an increase in business traveler occupancy rates 
in addition to the growth in vod  the pay tv group continued to experience growing acceptance for its partially edited services during the fiscal year 
accordingly  we are seeing a shift in our distribution away from our most edited service pleasure as more cable operators choose to launch our partially edited services ten  ten clips  ten blue and ten blox 
during our fiscal year we did experience one instance in which an affiliate system of a cable mso removed all adult content from its ppv platform and distributed adult content via its vod platform exclusively 
the result was a decrease in overall revenue from the adult category  as the buys from their ppv platform did not fully transition to the vod platform 
as such  this mso has decided not to pursue this action in any of their other systems 
we do not anticipate that other cable msos will remove adult entirely from their ppv platforms until vod becomes a more generally accepted manner by which to watch video content 
we believe this shift from ppv to vod will occur slowly over a three to six year period  in the same manner in which cable msos transitioned their consumer base from analog cable to digital cable 
we continue to launch our ppv services to cable msos  and we are anticipating new launches of our partially edited services to the largest cable mso in the us as it transitions its editing standard from most edited to partially edited 
to date  the focus of the pay tv group has been on the distribution of its ppv and vod services to cable  dbs and hotel platforms in the us market only 
the pay tv group also provides its two least edited services to the c band market on a direct to the consumer basis 
c band customers contact the pay tv group s in house call center directly to purchase the networks on a one month or three month subscription  or ppv basis 
the pay tv group retains of the revenue from these customers and over of the sales are made via credit cards 
this market has been declining for several years as these consumers convert from c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller  inch digital dbs satellite systems 
the pay tv group has been able to decrease its transponder  uplinking  marketing  and call center costs related to this business over the years in order to maintain its margins 
however  based on the rate of revenue decline and the expected erosion of its c band margins  the pay tv group expects that it will no longer be operating this business by the end of its fiscal year 
the pay tv group expects continued declines in revenue from this segment of its business during looking forward  management has identified certain challenges and risks that could impact the pay tv group s future financial results including the following increased competition from other adult companies attempting to provide vod content and ppv services to cable providers or dbs platforms increased regulation of the adult industry increased competition attempting to acquire compelling adult content each of these challenges and risks has the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  we believe that our company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks 
we believe that many opportunities accompany these challenges and risks 
among these opportunities  we believe the following exist for the pay tv group continued growth in the vod market  including potential distribution by dish network obtaining distribution with the regional bell operating companies rboc as they begin to deploy video content to their consumers obtaining distribution for our ppv services with directv implementation of technologies that will allow for distribution of our content on new platforms future international distribution opportunities internet segment the internet group generates revenue by selling monthly memberships to its website  ten 
com  by earning a percentage of revenue from third party gatekeepers like on command for the distribution of ten 
com to their customer base  and by selling pre packaged video and photo content to webmasters for a monthly fee 
in fiscal year  the internet group also generated revenue by selling traffic from its sites that did not convert into a member to other webmasters 
due to the decline in the volume of traffic to ten 
com  we no longer generate revenue from selling non converting traffic to other webmasters 
during our and fiscal years  we significantly restructured our internet business 
the decision to restructure our internet business was based on a number of factors including the large number of adult websites competing for web surfers  the lack of barriers to entry into the adult internet business  the increased regulation from visa and mastercard  and the amount of free adult content available on the internet 
through this restructuring we moved the internet group from los angeles  california to boulder  colorado  decreased staffing levels from approximately employees to seven  decreased the number of websites we were creating and managing from thirty to one  discontinued the practice of purchasing large amounts of traffic  and focused the business on creating a premiere broadband website branded as ten 
com 
in addition  in connection with a legal settlement  the internet group transferred approximately of its primary domain names to a third party as of april  the transfer of these domain names resulted in a significant  although expected  decline in traffic volume to ten 
com 
once the restructuring was completed  we shifted our focus to forming long term revenue sharing partnerships with third party gatekeepers for the distribution of ten 
com  whereby we could gain direct access to consumers in search of adult entertainment 
we completed one such agreement with on command for the distribution of ten 
com through their digitally wired hotel rooms 
over of revenue from the internet group continues to be generated from monthly memberships to ten 
com 
however  we have seen this revenue erode over the past several years since the current traffic volume to ten 
com does not generate enough new monthly sign ups to offset the churn of our renewing membership base 
the decline in our membership revenue slowed during our fiscal year as new marketing efforts increased traffic to ten 
com  generating monthly sign ups that were close to or slightly exceeding our monthly cancellation rate 
in addition  we increased the retail price for our website from to during the fiscal year 
we are working on implementing new pricing strategies to increase revenues generated by our website  including selling our searchable library of content on a pay per view and pay per minute basis 
we have also seen a decrease in revenue generated from selling pre packaged content to webmasters during the past three fiscal years 
this decrease in revenue from the sale of content is due to a softening in demand for content by third party webmasters 
webmasters are decreasing their reliance on outside sources for content and demanding lower prices for the content that they do purchase 
in addition  we have not allocated any significant resources towards a sales effort for these content products 
during our fiscal year we will be implementing usage based pricing as an alternative to our current flat monthly rate pricing 
we believe that this will be a more attractive alternative for our webmaster customers 
during the fiscal year  our internet group will be focused on the development of a wireless product for distribution both domestically and internationally 
this wireless product will include a wireless enabled web site  photo and video content  and ring moans 
we anticipate selling our product on a subscription and a la carte basis 
product pricing and revenue sharing agreements with the carriers are still being developed 
we anticipate initial launches to occur in the us  south america and europe within the next three to six months 
we are unable to project the revenues associated with our wireless product at this time 
our internet group will also be working to develop interactive adult games for distribution on cable  dbs and hotel platforms during our fiscal year 
we anticipate launches for these products in the second half of that fiscal year 
we are unable to project the revenues associated with our interactive products at this time 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances  goodwill impairment  and prepaid distribution rights content licensing 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed with our audit committee the development  selection  and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
revenue recognition our revenues for the pay tv group are primarily related to the sale of our ppv and vod services to cable dbs and hotel affiliates 
the cable affiliates do not report actual monthly ppv or vod sales for each of their systems to the pay tv group until days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the pay tv group s historical experience for each affiliated system 
the pay tv group subsequently adjusts its revenue to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt of the cash 
historically  any differences between the amounts estimated and the actual amounts received have been immaterial due to the overall predictability of pay per view revenues 
since vod is such a new service  the revenue expected from new vod cable affiliates can be more difficult to predict 
the pay tv group believes that it is conservative in estimating the impact of the rollout of vod households  and it continually adjusts estimates to reflect actual revenue remitted 
the recognition of revenues for both the pay tv and internet groups is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
income tax expense and accruals our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves at the time that we determine that it is probable that we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable 
such liabilities are recorded in the line item income taxes payable receivable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense  or additional paid in capital when appropriate  when the amounts involved become known 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
accounting for investments in debt and equity securities we hold investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  excluded from earnings and initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments to the available for sale securities fair value impact the consolidated financial statements by increasing or decreasing assets and shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are reflected in income 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method 
through the end of fiscal year  the company amortized its goodwill over years using the straight line method 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas  that was effective for the company as of the beginning of fiscal year  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
the company completed the initial impairment test during the first quarter of fiscal year and concluded that the fair value of the company s reporting unit the pay tv group exceeded its respective carrying value as of june  and  therefore  no impairment existed at that date 
in addition to the initial impairment test completed during the first quarter of fiscal year  we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment process compares the fair value of the pay tv group to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the pay tv group 
we concluded for the   and fiscal years that the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment charge was required 
if actual operating results or cash flows are different than our estimates and assumptions  we could be required to record impairment charges in future periods 
prepaid distribution rights content licensing our pay tv and internet group s film and content libraries consist of newly produced and historical film licensing agreements 
we account for the licenses in accordance with sfas financial accounting by broadcasters 
accordingly  we capitalize the costs associated with the licenses and certain editing costs and amortize the costs on a straight line basis over the life of the licensing agreement usually to years 
pursuant to sfas  the costs associated with the license agreements should be amortized in a manner that is consistent with expected revenues to be derived from such films 
we have determined that it is appropriate to amortize these costs on a straight line basis under the assertion that each usage of the film is expected to generate similar revenues 
we regularly review and evaluate the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis and assess if an accelerated method would more appropriately reflect the revenue generation of the content 
through our analysis  we have concluded that the current policy of recognizing the costs incurred to license the film library on a straight line basis most accurately reflects the revenue generated by each film 
we periodically review our film library and assess if the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the films 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film library  we will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value of the film library to the fair market value 
results of operations pay tv group the following table outlines the current distribution environment and network households for each network and our vod service estimated network households in thousands network distribution method as of march  as of march  as of march  pleasure cable   ten cable dbs   ten clips cable dbs   video on demand cable  ten xtsy c band cable dbs  ten blueplus c band cable n a n a ten max c band cable ten blue cable   ten blox cable   total network households   ten xtsy  ten blueplus and ten max addressable household numbers include million  million  and million c band addressable households for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the pay tv group discontinued providing its ten blueplus network in february the above table reflects network household distribution 
a household will be counted more than once if the home has access to more than one of the pay tv group s services  since each service represents an incremental revenue stream 
the pay tv group estimates its unique household distribution as of march  and to be million and million cable homes  respectively  and million and million dbs homes  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain financial information for the pay tv group for the three years ended march in millions twelve months ended march percent change vs vs net revenue ppv cable dbs vod cable hotel c band total cost of sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating income net revenue ppv cable dbs revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s ppv revenues from to was attributable to the following items an increase in revenues generated by our three services on the dish platform a increase in cable ppv revenues from our partially edited services revenue from our ten  ten clips and ten xtsy networks on the dish platform increased year over year 
we attribute this to an increase in the number of subscribers to the dish platform as well as to certain changes that dish has made to the way it prices and packages its adult programming networks 
the increase in revenue from our partially edited services is related to the continued growing acceptance by our consumer base for our partially edited services  ten  ten blue  ten blox  and ten clips 
we view this as a positive development given the higher buy rates and higher retail rates associated with this editing standard 
in anticipation of the increased acceptance for partially edited programming  we launched two new networks  ten blue and ten blox  in january the distribution of our four partially edited services increased to million network households as of march  from million network households as of march   representing an increase of 
approximately half of this increased distribution during our fiscal year can be attributed to our newest distribution agreement with cox communications  inc at the same time that we are experiencing an increase in the distribution of our partially edited services  we are experiencing a decline in the distribution of our most edited service  pleasure  by certain msos 
revenue from our pleasure service declined year over year as one of our largest customers transitioned from distributing primarily pleasure in to primarily distributing our partially edited services in additionally  during the fiscal year we anticipate the loss of additional pleasure distribution as the largest cable mso in the us transitions its services from most edited to partially edited 
however  this loss in distribution should be offset by this mso adding one or more of our partially edited services 
vod cable hotel revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s vod revenue from to is attributable to the following an increase in the number of households to which ten on demand is available distribution for ten on demand increased to million households as of march  from million households as of march   representing an increase of 
much of the increase in this distribution was attributable to the largest cable mso in the us upgrading its affiliate systems to be vod capable 
during the current fiscal year  we were the exclusive provider of adult vod content to this mso s platform 
the editing standard for this content was our most edited  resulting in lower average revenues per subscriber 
beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year  this cable mso will be transitioning its vod content to partially edited 
at the same time  we will begin to share the vod platform with two competitors 
it is too soon to determine the exact impact to our revenue as a result of the changes being implemented by this cable mso 
we anticipate that any decline in revenue from additional competition will be more than offset by the increase in revenue generally associated with distributing partially edited content instead of most edited content 
additionally  during our fiscal year  we anticipate that our largest competitor will also be added to this platform 
we do not know when this will occur during the year or what the impact to our revenues will be at that time 
until the third quarter of our current fiscal year  we were the exclusive provider of adult vod content to the time warner affiliate systems 
at that time  our largest competitor was added to the vod platform 
although competition has been added to the platform  we do continue to retain the largest share of vod content  providing over hours of vod content to the time warner systems 
however  our revenue has declined since competition was added to the platform 
we do not anticipate any further declines in our revenue as a result of the additional competition 
revenue from our hotel vod service provided to on command declined from this decline was a result of on command adding content from our competitors during our fiscal year 
we continue to provide over of the content to this platform 
ppv cable dbs revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s ppv revenues from to was attributable to the following items a increase in revenue generated by our three services on the dish platform an increase in cable revenue from our partially edited services revenue from our ten  ten clips and ten xtsy networks on the dish platform increased year over year 
this increase was due to an overall increase in ppv buys for each service while the number of monthly subscribers to each service increased 
we believe that the increases in buys and subscribers can be attributed to the increase in overall subscribers to the dish platform 
the increase in cable revenue from our partially edited services is related to the growing acceptance for our partially edited services  as discussed above 
our four partially edited services were distributed to million network households as of march   as compared to million network households as of march   representing a increase 
vod cable hotel revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s vod revenues from to was attributable to the following items an increase in the number of vod households to which ten on demand is available the addition of vod revenue from the hospitality industry revenue from our vod service became a significant contributor to the pay tv group s revenue mix during the fiscal year as cable operators aggressively upgraded their plants to deliver content in this manner to their customers 
our vod content was available through our distribution arrangements with cable msos to million cable network households as of march   up from million households as of march   representing an increase of 
during the fiscal year  we also began delivering our vod content to over  hotel rooms through our distribution arrangement with on command 
through this agreement we deliver up to titles on a monthly basis to on command for use on their in room entertainment platform  which they provide to the hospitality industry 
c band revenue the year over year decreases in c band revenue are due to the continued decline of the c band market as consumers convert c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller  inch digital dbs satellite systems 
the total c band market declined from to and from to although the c band market has continued to decline  our c band revenue has declined at a slightly slower rate due to the fact that our only competitor on this platform went out of business during the fiscal year 
providing service to the c band market continues to be profitable for us  generating operating margins of approximately during the fiscal year 
we will continue to closely monitor this business and when margins erode to an unacceptable level we will discontinue providing our content on this platform 
we anticipate that we will no longer be providing our networks on the c band platform by the end of the fiscal year 
in an effort to minimize costs associated with this revenue stream  we discontinued selling ten blueplus on the c band platform during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of expenses associated with our digital broadcast facility  satellite uplinking  satellite transponder leases  programming acquisition and conforming costs  vod transport costs  amortization of content licenses  and c band call center costs 
the decrease in costs of sales from fiscal year to is due to a a decline in costs associated with our in house call center  b a decrease in our c band transponder costs  c a decrease in our uplinking costs  and d a decrease in our programming and editing costs 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in our vod transport costs 
our call center costs decreased year over year due to staff layoffs necessitated by declining call volume as the c band market continues to erode 
our c band transponder costs have decreased year over year due to the termination of the transponder lease related to our ten blueplus network  which we ceased broadcasting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  as well as to the renegotiation of our existing analog transponders during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
we anticipate annual savings of  under the new pricing structure for our remaining two analog transponders 
our uplinking costs declined year over year due to the renegotiation of this contract with our current provider during the first quarter of our fiscal year 
our programming and editing costs have decreased year over year because we are no longer outsourcing these services to a third party 
our own in house programming and editing departments are able to perform these services at a much lower cost 
vod transport costs have increased year over year in line with the increase in our vod distribution and the number of programming hours that we are providing to cable msos 
as of the beginning of our fiscal year we will be utilizing a new vod transport provider to deliver our vod content to the largest cable operator in the us we are anticipating annual savings of over million once this change is fully implemented 
the increase in cost of sales from fiscal year to is due to a a increase in costs associated with our digital broadcast center and b the addition of vod transport costs during the fiscal year 
the increase in costs related to our digital broadcast facility is due to the hiring of additional personnel to manage our growing vod business 
we also began paying transport costs to tvn for the services they provide in delivering our vod content to cable msos during the fiscal year 
the increase in these costs was partially offset by a decrease in c band call center costs and a decrease in transponder costs from to the pay tv group successfully renegotiated the lease costs for its analog transponders during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we discontinued one of our c band services allowing us to terminate the lease for one of our analog transponders 
operating income operating income increased from to primarily as a result of an increase in our gross margins 
gross margins increased to from year over year due to a increase in revenue combined with a decrease in cost of sales 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined from of revenue during our fiscal year to of revenue during our fiscal year 
overall  operating expenses increased 
this increase in operating expenses is a result of an increase in our brand promotion costs 
during the fiscal year we incurred costs for several consumer outreach events to promote the ten brand and services 
in addition  we incurred increased costs for a brand marketing event at the major adult industry trade show held annually in january 
the increase in our brand promotion costs was partially offset by a decline in marketing costs associated with our c band barker channel  which we discontinued using during the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we anticipate that our operating costs will increase during the fiscal year as we intend to have a much larger presence at many of our major cable and dbs trade shows due to the increased competitive pressures 
in addition  we anticipate operating costs will increase in due to salary adjustments given to many of our staff in order to remain competitive in the market place 
operating income increased from to largely as a result of a increase in revenue year over year 
gross margins increased from to year over year and operating expenses declined during the same period 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the fiscal year from for the fiscal year 
the decrease in operating expenses from to is primarily related to a decrease in c band marketing costs during the fiscal year 
at the end of the first quarter of our fiscal year  the pay tv group discontinued using its barker channel to market its c band services 
the decrease in operating costs associated with the barker channel was offset by an increase in sales commissions and costs associated with the pay tv group s in house promotions department 
sales commissions increased during the fiscal year due to an increase in distribution for our ppv and vod services 
costs associated with operating our in house promotions department increased during the fiscal year as we hired more personnel to produce and edit the promotional and branding elements of our ppv and vod programming 
internet group the following table sets forth certain financial information for the internet group for the three years ended march in millions twelve months ended march percent change vs vs net revenue net membership sale of content sale of traffic total cost of sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating income loss net revenue the decline in net membership revenue from to and the decline in net membership revenue from to was a result of a decline in traffic to our web sites as we eliminated most of our traffic generating programs during the and fiscal years 
we ceased actively purchasing traffic for our web sites during the fiscal year ended march  instead  we depended primarily upon our adult domain names and the advertising of ten 
com on the pay tv group s networks to generate type in traffic for ten 
com 
at the end of the fiscal year  we transferred domain names to a third party in settlement of a lawsuit 
the loss of these urls resulted in an expected decline in the volume of traffic to ten 
com during the fiscal year such that the number of new monthly sign ups was not enough to offset the monthly cancellation rate 
during the fiscal year we implemented new pricing and marketing strategies that helped to slow the decline in our membership revenue 
during the year we increased our monthly membership to from 
in addition  we now offer a three month membership for 
this price increase applies only to new members joining our site 
accordingly  the price increase will initially have a minimal effect on our revenue as old members continue to be billed at the rate in effect at the time that they joined the site 
in addition  we are investigating alternative pricing methodologies for our website  including pay per minute and pay per view 
we believe that offering unique payment terms for our website content will increase revenues 
the decrease in revenue from the sale of content during the past three fiscal years is a result of a softening in demand for content by third party webmasters 
webmasters are decreasing their reliance on outside sources for content and demanding lower prices for the content that they do purchase 
in addition  we did not allocate any significant resources towards a sales effort for our content products during the and fiscal years 
during the fiscal year we contracted with a third party marketing company to sell our content products to the webmaster community 
we terminated this relationship during the year because we were not experiencing any increases in the sale of our content products 
we are currently investigating other ways to price our webmaster products  including selling content on a bandwidth usage basis rather than a flat  recurring monthly fee 
revenue from the sale of traffic was earned by forwarding exit traffic and traffic from selected vanity domains to affiliated webmaster marketing programs domestically  monetizing foreign traffic via international dialer companies  marketing affiliated webmaster sites through our double opt in email list  and by directing traffic to our pay per click ppc search engine  www

due to the decline in traffic volume to ten 
com  our sale of traffic revenue was completely eliminated during the fiscal year 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of variable expenses associated with credit card fees  bandwidth costs  traffic acquisition costs purchase of traffic  web site content costs and depreciation of assets 
cost of sales  as a percentage of revenue  was   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of sales from to is primarily related to a decline in depreciation expense and bandwidth costs 
the decline in these costs was partially offset by an increase in content amortization and traffic acquisition costs 
depreciation costs have declined from as much of our equipment has reached the end of its depreciable life 
bandwidth costs have declined due to the continued renegotiation of these services with our vendors 
traffic acquisition costs have increased due to new marketing programs implemented during the fiscal year 
these marketing programs pay webmasters a one time fee of of the first month s membership revenue 
the effect of these marketing programs has been to attract additional traffic to our site  resulting in a slight reduction in our churn rate 
as a result of these new marketing programs  traffic acquisition costs increased from of net membership revenue in to of net membership revenue in content amortization costs increased during because we are fully allocating the amortization of the pleasure library to the internet group since this content is primarily utilized within the ten 
com website 
the decrease in cost of sales from to is related to a decline in depreciation expense and bandwidth costs 
these costs declined due to the data center restructuring completed during the fiscal year see data center restructuring below through which we wrote off excess equipment  moved the data center to boulder  colorado  and negotiated more favorable bandwidth rates 
in addition  we eliminated the costs associated with our pay per click search engine and email program at the end of fiscal year 
variable costs related to the processing of credit cards for membership revenue also declined from to in tandem with the decrease in this revenue stream 
operating income loss the decline in operating income from to is primarily due to the fact that our cost of sales and operating expenses declined by million while our revenue declined by million year over year 
the decline in operating expenses from to was primarily related to a decrease in legal  advertising  payroll  and property tax expenses 
legal expenses during  which declined from  included a non recurring million charge for the settlement of a lawsuit during the year 
we expect to incur additional costs during the fiscal year with respect to our entry into the wireless market 
we anticipate operating costs related to the wireless market to be less than million during the fiscal year 
costs will relate to product creation  consulting  sales and marketing 
operating income increased from to primarily due to the fact that cost of sales and operating expenses declined by million year over year while revenue for the same period declined by only million 
the decline in operating expenses from to is related to decreases in payroll  benefits and other office expenses for all of our departments as a result of the final restructuring completed during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year see internet restructuring below 
this restructuring resulted in a decrease in sales  marketing  data center  and web development personnel 
restructuring expenses recovery in millions twelve months ended march asset impairment expense restructuring expense recovery total impairment and restructuring data center restructuring during the fiscal year ended march   we adopted a restructuring plan to close the internet group s in house data center in sherman oaks  california and move its servers  bandwidth and content delivery functions to the same location as the pay tv group s digital broadcast facility in boulder  colorado 
total restructuring charges of million related to this plan were recorded during the year  of which  related to the termination of employees 
also included in this charge was million of rent expense related to the data center space in sherman oaks and million related to the write off of excess equipment 
internet restructuring during the fiscal year ended march   we adopted a final restructuring plan to eliminate positions within our internet group 
total restructuring charges of million were recorded  of which  related to the termination of thirteen positions and million related to the write off of excess equipment and operating leases 
asset impairment we recognized impairment losses on certain domain names owned by our internet group of million during the fiscal year ended march  management identified certain conditions  including a declining gross margin due to the availability of free adult content on the internet and decreased traffic to the internet group s domain names  as indicators of asset impairment 
these conditions led to operating results and forecasted future results that were substantially less than had been anticipated at the time of our acquisition of the internet group 
we revised our projections and determined that the projected results would not fully support the future amortization of the domain names associated with the internet group 
in accordance with the company s policy  management assessed the recoverability of the domain names using a cash flow projection based on the remaining amortization period of two to four years 
based on this projection  the cumulative cash flow over the remaining amortization periods was insufficient to fully recover the intangible asset balance 
restructuring recovery during the fiscal year ended march   we reached a settlement with the landlord of the space used by our internet group in sherman oaks  california 
the settlement required that we pay the landlord  we were subsequently released from any ongoing obligations for this space 
as part of this transaction  we reversed the remaining rent restructuring reserve of million into income 
corporate administration the following table sets forth certain financial information for corporate administration expenses for the three years ended march in millions twelve months ended march percent change vs vs operating expenses expenses related to corporate administration include all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the pay tv and internet operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal and accounting expenses  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq and the sec  investor relation cost  and printing costs associated with the company s public filings 
the increase in corporate administration expenses from to is primarily due to a an increase in outside accounting fees  b an increase in listing fees  and c an increase in payroll costs 
these costs were partially offset by declines in consulting and legal fees 
outside accounting fees increased from due to our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act section 
during the current fiscal year  we hired an outside consulting firm to assist us with documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting as required by section in addition  our external audit fees increased as a result of the additional audit work required for section listing fees increased from due to the payment of a one time fee for our application to the nasdaq national market during the fiscal year ended march  payroll costs increased from as a result of additional personnel hired by our accounting and legal departments as well as to an increase in executive bonuses 
the decline in consulting expense is related to fees paid during to our former chief executive officer and to a non cash expense related to the extension of his stock options 
outside legal fees declined due to the addition of an in house attorney who was able to internally manage many legal issues that we had outsourced in past years 
the decrease in corporate administration expenses from to is primarily due to an decrease in legal fees 
legal fees decreased from due to the settlement of a lawsuit with three former officers of our company during the last quarter of our fiscal year 
in addition  we also saw a decrease in our postage  printing and public relation expenses 
these expenses were higher in the fiscal year due to the proxy fight that the company was involved in during that year 
consulting costs also declined from  as we were no longer using an outside corporate advisory firm 
the decline in these costs was offset by an increase in our accounting and auditing costs and an increase in fees paid to our outside board members for the fiscal year 
deferred taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  the separate recognition  measured at currently enacted tax rates  of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion will not be realized 
the company routinely evaluates its recorded deferred tax assets to determine whether it is still more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
during the year ended march   we recognized a net deferred tax asset of  related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we determined that it was more likely than not that million of our net deferred tax assets would not be realized and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance for this amount 
the million relates to potentially expiring net operating loss carryforwards 
during the years ended march  and  we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized and we  accordingly  recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
during the current year  the company generated taxable income against which these tax attributes were applied  and accordingly  reversed a portion of the valuation allowance except as explained below 
during the year ended march   options and warrants were exercised and certain disqualifying dispositions occurred resulting in deductions for tax purposes 
similar benefits were included in the company s net operating losses 
these deductions resulted in a benefit of million to additional paid in capital during the current year

this cash from financing activities was offset by the repayment of a million secured note payable that was due to an unrelated third party 
our remaining debt is related to capital lease and other financing obligations 
interest expense is expected to remain immaterial during the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year we issued million shares of class a redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the proceeds from this offering were used to repay million of the company s notes payable 
an additional million in debt was converted to million shares of class a redeemable preferred stock 
during the fiscal year  we issued million shares of class b redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem million of the company s class a redeemable preferred stock and to fund the purchase and subsequent retirement of  shares of new frontier media  inc common stock from edward bonn  a former officer of the company 
during the fiscal year  we redeemed million of the class a and class b redeemable preferred stock 
in addition  during the fiscal year million of the class b redeemable preferred stock was converted into a note payable which was then subsequently repaid 
much of our cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year was offset by the exercise of stock options and warrants which generated cash from financing activities of million 
if we were to lose our major customers that account for   and of our revenue  our ability to finance our future operating requirements would be severely impaired 
we currently have a million line of credit available through a commercial banking relationship 
this line of credit expires in june  although we anticipate renewing it at that time 
the interest rate applied to the line of credit is variable based on the current prime rate 
the balance on the line of credit is currently and we have not drawn down on it during our fiscal year 
the line of credit  if utilized  would be secured by our pay tv group s trade accounts receivable and it requires that we comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
we paid approximately million in federal and state income taxes during the fiscal year 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be for our fiscal year and that we will pay more federal and state income taxes in due to the full utilization of our available net operating losses and deductions from the exercise of stock options and warrants during our fiscal year 
in addition  we anticipate capital expenditures to be no more than million during our fiscal year and that our content licensing expenditures will be no more than million 
we believe that existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements  and we believe that any capital expenditures that may be incurred can be financed through our cash flows from operations

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
this statement supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance and is effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after june  this statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
the cumulative effect of initially applying this statement  if any  is recognized as of the required effective date 
this statement addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity  in an exchange for goods or services  incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the company has not yet determined what effect sfas r will have on the company s consolidated results of operation or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is principally confined to cash in the bank  money market accounts  and notes payable  which have short maturities and  therefore  minimal and immaterial market risk 
interest rate risk 
as of june   the company had cash in checking and money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and fixed income debt securities 
because of the short maturities of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these assets 
furthermore  the company s borrowings are at fixed interest rates  limiting the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company does not have any foreign currency exposure because it currently does not transact business in foreign currencies
