item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the item selected financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data and the related notes thereto in this annual report on form k 
overview edgewater is an innovative technology management consulting firm providing a unique blend of premium it services 
our primary target is the middle market whose needs span the full spectrum of our offerings 
we also provide specialized premium services to divisions of global companies 
during the fiscal year ended december   we generated revenues  including reimbursement of out of pocket expenses  of approximately million from a total of clients 
headquartered in wakefield  massachusetts  as of december   our company employed approximately technical consulting professionals 
our ability to generate revenue is affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
a decline in the level of business activity of our clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profit margin 
over the past four years  our business has been negatively impacted by weakened it services spending environment  which caused some clients to reduce or defer their expenditures for consulting services 
we have implemented and will continue to implement cost savings initiatives to manage our expenses as a percentage of revenue as appropriate 
the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel expenses consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting  third party vendor payments and non billable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
we consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance 
the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge our clients and the non billable costs associated with securing new client engagements and developing new service offerings 
the remainder of our recurring operating expenses is comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the rent of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue level 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements for new engagements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client engagements and participate in our sales efforts to secure new client assignments 
the company s management monitors and assesses its operating performance by evaluating key metrics and indicators 
for example  we review information related to annualized revenue per billable consultant  periodic consultant utilization rates  gross profit margins and billable employee headcount 
this information  along with other operating performance metrics is used in evaluating our overall performance 
these metrics and indicators are discussed in more detail under results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions  upon which we rely  are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements may be affected 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  valuation of deferred tax assets  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere herein  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
we have identified the policies listed below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from providing it and management consulting services under written service contracts with our customers 
the service contracts we enter into generally fall into three specific categories time and materials  fixed price and fixed fee 
our revenues are generated from sources such as technical consulting  custom software development  integration services  business intelligence consulting and managed services 
revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from strategy engagements  technical consulting and custom software development and integration services  and managed services represented the following for the year ended december  strategy engagements consulting and development and integration services managed services the company derives a significant portion of its service revenue from time and materials based contracts 
time and materials contracts represented  and of service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates 
from time to time  the company may offer volume purchase arrangements as part of its time and materials contracts to its customers 
in accordance with emerging issues task force abstract eitf no 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  the company has deferred payment amounts based upon its current estimates of the actual discounts expected to be earned by the customers 
as of december   the company had recorded as deferred revenue a liability in the amount of million related to volume purchase arrangements 
revenue pursuant to fixed price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting 
fixed price contracts represented  and of service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
over the course of a fixed price contract  we routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period 
to measure the performance and our ability to recognize revenue and profitability on fixed price contracts  we compare actual direct costs incurred to the total estimated direct costs and determine the percentage of the contract that is complete 
this percentage is multiplied by the estimated total contract value to determine the amount of net revenue that should be recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies and procedures  subject to any warranty provisions or other project management assessments as to the status of work performed 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones identified in any particular contract 
typically  the company provides warranty services on its fixed price contracts related to providing customers with the ability to have any design flaws remedied and or have our company fix routine software design defects 
the services  as outlined in the respective contracts  are provided for a specific period of time after a project is complete 
the company values the warranty services based upon historical labor hours incurred for similar services at standard billing rates 
in accordance with sab and sab  revenue related to the warranty provisions within our fixed price contracts is recognized as the services are performed and the revenue is earned 
the warranty term is typically short term or for a day period after the project is complete 
in the event we are unable to accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed on a fixed price contract  or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on a contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted projects are made on a contract by contract basis 
any known or probable losses on projects are charged to operations in the period in which such losses are determined 
a formal project review process takes place quarterly  although most projects are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
management reviews the estimated total direct costs on each contract to determine if the estimated amounts are accurate  and estimates are adjusted as needed in the period revised estimates are made 
there were no recorded losses on contacts during fiscal we also perform services on a fixed fee basis under managed services contracts  which include monthly hosting and support services 
fixed fee contracts represented  and of service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue under fixed fee contracts are recognized as fixed monthly amounts  for a specified period of time  as outlined within the respective contract 
when a customer enters into a time and materials  fixed price contract or a fixed fee contract  the related revenue is accounted for under eitf  revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
for all arrangements  we evaluate the deliverables in each contract to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables represent separate units of accounting  we then measure and allocate the consideration from the arrangement to the separate units  based on reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable 
client prepayments  even if nonrefundable  are deferred classified as a liability and recognized over future periods as services are performed 
as of december   the company has recorded a deferred liability of approximately million included in the financial statement caption of deferred revenue and other liabilities related to customer prepayments 
revenues from software resale contracts are included in service revenues and were less than of total revenues for all periods presented 
revenue and related costs are recognized and amounts are invoiced to our customers upon the customer receipt of the purchased software 
all related warranty and maintenance arrangements are performed by the primary vendor of the software and are not the obligation of the company 
we recognize revenues for services where the collection from the client is probable and our fees are fixed or determinable 
we establish billing terms at the time at which the project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our standard payment terms are days from invoice date 
reimbursement of out of pocket expenses charged to customers is reflected as revenue 
our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from year to year based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
certain significant estimates include those used for fixed price contracts  such as deferrals related to our volume purchase agreements  warranty holdbacks  and allocations of fair value of elements under multiple element arrangements  and the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
in determining our current income tax provision  we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to a value we believe will be recoverable by future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about the company s future income over the life of the deferred tax asset  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
management s assumptions about future income require significant judgment because actual income has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
as of december   the gross value of the deferred tax asset recorded on the company s balance sheet was approximately million 
this amount was comprised of approximately million in federal net operating loss nol carry forwards  million in state nol carry forwards  million in available federal credits  and million in net deferred temporary timing differences 
these amounts were offset by a valuation reserve of approximately million providing for a net deferred tax asset of million 
the valuation reserve is representative of the company s assessment of the expected future realization of recorded deferred tax assets 
when assessing the probability of the future realization of the recorded value of this asset  the company reviews its planned future income and profitability projections 
in projecting future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results and trends  our project pipeline  and other appropriate factors 
based upon these analyses  the company believes that it is more than likely that it will be able to recover the currently recorded value of our net deferred tax assets by achieving a compounded annual revenue growth rate of approximately and achieving annual profitability in the range of to through fiscal however  if we do not generate sufficient future income and profits  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense  thereby reducing net income or increasing net loss  in the period in which it is determined that it is more likely than not that either a portion or all of the deferred tax asset is recoverable 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets intangibles are no longer subject to amortization  rather  they are subject to an assessment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred  but at least annually  by applying a fair value based test 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level  using a discounted cash flow method 
prior to april   the company amortized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives not to exceed years  and periodically reviewed the recoverability of these assets based on the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test requires our management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  the company performs internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows 
this approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and perpetual growth rate  among others 
upon adoption of sfas in fiscal  the company recorded as a change in accounting principle  a non cash impairment charge of million 
on december   our selected annual measurement date  our company recorded an additional non cash charge of million due to a further impairment of the recorded goodwill 
no other impairment has been recorded in the periods presented 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  the company  on june   acquired intelix  inc and recorded million in goodwill and million in identifiable intangible assets  which are being amortized over a period of four to eight years 
on october   the company acquired ranzal and recorded million in goodwill and million in identified intangible assets  which are being amortized over a period of two to five years 
results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december  service revenues 
during the year ended december   total revenues increased by million  or  over fiscal revenues of million to million 
our annualized revenue per billable consultant  adjusted for utilization  increased to thousand during fiscal as compared to thousand in fiscal primarily due to the incremental benefits of improved billing and utilization rates during the fourth quarter of the company increased the number of customers it served to clients during fiscal as compared to clients during fiscal  which was primarily the result of the ranzal acquisition 
while our overall revenue remained flat on a year over year basis  in fiscal  revenue from our five largest customers  including synapse  decreased as a percentage of total revenue to of our total revenues as compared to in fiscal due to the company s revenue diversification efforts 
fiscal revenues were primarily affected by two factors 
our revenues were enhanced by the october  acquisition of ranzal  which added approximately million in fourth quarter revenues 
the incremental year over year increase from ranzal revenues was also mitigated by a decrease of approximately million in revenues related to edgewater technology s core business 
the decrease in edgewater technology core revenues is primarily attributable to a reduction in revenue from synapse  a related party and our largest customer 
synapse revenue declined by approximately million  or  to million as compared to fiscal revenues of million 
the company also experienced continued delays and reductions in overall it spending as the us economic environment continued to be sluggish during cost of services 
cost of services consists of project personnel costs principally related to salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits and travel expenses for personnel dedicated to customer projects 
these costs represent the most significant expense we incur in providing our services 
in total  project personnel costs increased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in the fiscal increase in project personnel costs is partially attributable to the ranzal acquisition  which added approximately billable consultants and million in related personnel costs  and the full year effect of the june intelix acquisition  which added approximately billable consultants in and increased project personnel costs by an additional million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  project personnel costs before out of pocket expense reimbursements increased from during fiscal to during fiscal the increase in project personnel costs  as a percentage of revenues  reflects decreases in the company s billable consultant utilization rates  which decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in as compared to million in gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the fiscal decrease in gross profit is partially related to a decrease in edgewater technology core revenues during the second half of fiscal as market conditions led to a reduced level of it spending and delayed it spending decisions 
the effect of these conditions caused a decrease in our billable consultant utilization rates  which decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal on an overall basis 
the fiscal utilization rate decrease is in large part attributable to a decrease of million in revenues from the company s largest customer 
these decreases in edgewater s core business were offset by the fiscal gross profit contribution of ranzal  which added million in gross profit during the fourth quarter 
additionally  in fiscal  the company experienced an increase in billable and unbilled expenses 
billable and unbilled expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal to as compared to in fiscal this increase represents of the fiscal reduction in gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
fiscal sg a expenses of million  or of revenues  remained consistent with fiscal expenditure levels 
fiscal sg a expenses also totaled million and represented of revenues 
in fiscal  sg a expenses included a bonus accrual of million as compared to a bonus accrual of million in offsetting the current year reduction in bonus expense was an increase in sales and administrative salaries expenses of million  as the company increased sales headcount from average full time equivalents in to average full time equivalents 
in addition  fiscal sg a expenses included additional expenses related to the operations of ranzal in the amount of million  which were included in the fourth quarter operating results 
stock based compensation 
in may  the company s compensation committee authorized restricted share awards to certain executives of the company  aggregating  shares of the company s common stock 
the aggregate compensation expense associated with these awards is approximately million  which amount is being amortized straight line over the vesting term five years 
fiscal compensation expense related to these restricted share awards amounted to million as compared to fiscal expense of million 
the increase is attributable to a full year amortization of the awards in fiscal the company will be required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation in the third quarter of  which is expected to result in an increase in reported stock based compensation expense 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent with the fiscal amount of million 
fiscal depreciation expense decreased by million  to million  as compared to million in fiscal the decrease reflects continued spending controls on purchases of new fixed assets and an overall reduction in depreciation as older assets fully depreciate 
this decrease was offset by an increase in amortization related to the full year amortization of the intelix intangible assets and the incremental amortization related to the ranzal intangible assets of million in fiscal operating loss income 
operating income decreased million to million in as compared to operating income of million in the decrease in income is attributable to comparatively lower utilization rates  directly tied to decreased spending in it consulting markets in fiscal and increased salaries and wages related to strategic personnel investments  which were offset by million in fourth quarter operating income attributable to the recently acquired ranzal operations 
each of these items is explained in further detail above 
interest income expense  net 
we earned net interest income of million in  as compared to net interest income of million in the increase in interest income reflects a fiscal shift of our available cash and cash equivalent balances into less liquid marketable securities  which have increased yields on our invested balances when compared to the yields achieved in the prior year 
average maturity and yield rates for the year ended december  were approximately days and  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
the company  as a result of its net operating loss position for the year ended december   has not recorded a tax provision 
conversely  in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million  which represented a tax provision of million  based on an estimated effective rate of on operating income for state and federal income tax rates  offset by a benefit related to a refund receivable of million related to a net operating tax loss carry back claim 
we have deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior fiscal years  as well as differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their related amounts in the financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax asset amounts 
as of december   the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was approximately million  providing for a net deferred tax asset of million 
income loss from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations decreased million  to million in as compared to income of million in this decrease was primarily a result of lower revenues and operating margins  for the reasons described above 
in addition  a carry back tax claim of million was included in income during the previous year as compared to no carry back claim amounts being recorded in discontinued operations 
we have received and may continue to receive various tax notices and assessments from the irs and various state departments of revenue related to our former staffing businesses  which were sold in and during  our company was able to successfully resolve several outstanding assessments 
on a net basis  the company reversed approximately million from its discontinued operations accrual related to the successful resolution of our tax assessments 
the accrual decrease attributable to the irs notices totaled approximately million 
this decrease was offset by an increase in the accrual of million  which was primarily the result of an increase in a previously established reserve related to the company s expected lease payments on its former corporate headquarters in fayetteville  arkansas in the amount of million 
the increase in the lease accrual was deemed necessary after revising a previously prepared estimate with more current information 
in fiscal  we recorded a reserve of million representing the low end of potential payments to be made under certain irs notices  plus related professional fees 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
net loss income 
we recognized a net loss of million in as compared to net income of million in the net income decreased in primarily as a result of decreased revenue  gross margin and the tax benefit recorded in fiscal results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december  service revenues 
during the year ended december   total revenues increased by million  or  over fiscal revenues of million to million 
our annualized revenue per billable consultant  adjusted for utilization  increased to thousand during fiscal as compared to thousand in fiscal primarily due to improved billable consultant utilization rates 
the utilization rate improvement was attributable to organic growth attained from engaging new customers and retaining follow on business from existing customers during as a result of these fiscal improvements  the company s utilization rates for its billable consultants increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we served clients during fiscal as compared to clients during fiscal in fiscal  our five largest customers  including synapse  represented approximately of our total revenues as compared to in fiscal cost of services 
cost of services  which represents project personnel costs  increased  to million  in as compared to million in a significant portion of the year over year increase of approximately million is directly related to million in additional project personnel costs associated with the addition of billable consultants in connection with the mid year acquisition of intelix 
as a percentage of net revenue  project personnel costs before out of pocket expense reimbursements decreased from during fiscal to in fiscal the decrease  or improvement in project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues  is attributable to significantly improved utilization rates in fiscal   as compared to fiscal   combined with the increase in total billable consultants to as compared to in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased  to million  in as compared to million in gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  improved to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in gross profit and improvement of gross profit as a percentage of revenues  is directly related to the increase in billable hours in connection with the consulting services revenues before out of pocket expense reimbursements of million in fiscal as a result of the increase in billable hours  the average utilization rates improved to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
fiscal sg a expenses increased by million  to million  or of revenues  as compared to fiscal expenditure levels which totaled million and represented of revenues 
the year over year increase in absolute sg a expenses is directly related to fiscal accruals for performance based bonuses  which totaled million 
additionally  fiscal sg a expenses included incremental costs as the result of the intelix acquisition  which totaled million in the current fiscal year 
these increases were offset by reduced facilities and operating expenses in in an effort to streamline operations and costs 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  to million  in as compared to million in this decrease reflects tighter spending controls on purchases of new fixed assets and a relative reduction in depreciation as older assets fully depreciate  offset by slightly higher depreciation and amortization due to the intelix acquisition  which increase fiscal intangible asset amortization by approximately million 
impairment of goodwill 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  we adopted sfas no 
on january  and in accordance therewith  recorded as a change in accounting principle a non cash charge of million relating to an impairment of recorded goodwill 
on december   our selected annual measurement date  we recorded an additional non cash charge of million  relating to a further impairment of goodwill 
our net unamortized goodwill as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
restructuring 
in february  we implemented a workforce reduction to better align our consultant base to our expected revenues 
the company reduced headcount by approximately positions  which resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately million 
the restructuring charge consisted primarily of severance and similar employee payroll related termination expenses 
all amounts were paid as of december  operating income loss 
operating income increased million  to million  in as compared to an operating loss of million in this increase is due to higher utilization and a corresponding increase in revenue  combined with the effects of the restructuring and the impairment of goodwill in  as described above 
interest income expense  net 
we earned net interest income of million in  as compared to net interest income of million in this decrease is due the reduction in overall market interest yields for investment grade securities during the past twelve months and also due to the slightly lower average cash balances as a result of the acquisition of intelix  common stock repurchases and discontinued operations payments 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for  representing a tax provision of million based on an estimated effective rate of on operating income  inclusive of state and federal income tax rates  offset by a refund receivable related to the net operating tax loss carry back claim of million  for which benefit had not been previously recorded 
the effective tax rate for was zero  primarily due to net operating losses for which a benefit was not provided 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of our net deferred assets of approximately million as of december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
income loss from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million  to million  in as compared to a loss of million in this increase was primarily a result of higher operating profitability and the tax carry back claim  and the absence in of the goodwill impairment charge and restructuring charge which were recorded in discontinued operations 
we have received and may continue to receive various tax notices and assessments from the irs related to our former staffing businesses  which were sold in and  and related civil penalties concerning the purported untimely filing of tax information 
we recorded in a reserve of million representing the low end of our estimated exposure of our unresolved tax assessments  plus related professional fees 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
in  we recorded a million charge to discontinued operations relating to a litigation settlement with the purchaser of and successor to our commercial staffing business  which was sold in for approximately million 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
change in accounting principle 
as discussed above  we adopted sfas no 
on january  and  in accordance therewith  recorded as a change in accounting principle a non cash charge of million relating to an impairment of recorded goodwill 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
net income loss 
we recognized net income of million in as compared to a net loss of million in the net income increased substantially in due to additional operating income in offset by goodwill impairment charges taken in  which is described in further detail above 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated years ended december in thousands cash flows provided by used in operating activities  investing activities   financing activities   discontinued operating activities   extraordinary item total cash used during the year    as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  a million or decrease from the december  balance of million 
working capital  which is defined as current assets less current liabilities  decreased million  to million  as of december   as compared to million as of december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is primarily related to edgewater s fiscal stock repurchases of million and net cash used for the acquisition of ranzal of million 
these decreases were partially offset by proceeds from fiscal stock option exercises  which totaled million 
our primary historical sources of funds have been from operations and the proceeds from equity offerings  as well as sales of businesses in fiscal years and our principal historical uses of cash have been to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we generally pay our employees bi weekly for their services  while receiving payments from customers to days from the date of the invoice 
historically  a significant portion of the company s cash flows from operations have been derived from our largest customer  synapse  which is also a related party 
payments received by the company for services rendered to synapse totaled approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
all receivable amounts were collected within our normal business terms and our contracts with synapse are typically for a period of one year or more 
in the event there is a loss of revenue related to synapse  it would be expected that such a loss would have an adverse impact upon the company s operations and cash flows 
however  we believe such an impact could be mitigated through the management of employee headcount and through the redeployment of existing synapse related resources on to other consulting projects 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal changes in operating accounts included the fiscal loss from continuing operations of million  depreciation and amortization of million  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million related to the acquired ranzal operations  and a decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities of million as a result of the fiscal payment of the company s performance based bonus accrual

 depreciation and amortization of million  million in connection with a non cash goodwill impairment charge  and million as a result of net collections on outstanding receivables 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal net outflows related to million in purchases of marketable securities as the company transitioned cash and cash equivalents into longer term and higher yield investments and million in costs related to the october  purchase of ranzal 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million 
this was a result of million in net marketable security redemptions  which were offset by million in costs related to the june acquisition of intelix 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to million in net purchase of marketable securities 
as of december   we have no long term commitments for capital expenditures and all capital expenditures are discretionary 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities in each of these periods was primarily attributable to the repurchase of the company s common stock  which totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these purchases were offset by net proceeds from our employee stock purchase program and exercises of stock options 
net cash used in discontinued operations was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
these amounts represent payments made by the company related to its discontinued operations accrual 
as described in note of the consolidated financial statements and included elsewhere herein  the company  in made a strategic decision to undergo a comprehensive restructuring program to refocus future growth initiatives in its systems integration and consulting business and as a result  committed to divestures in each of its staffing businesses
