item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this section  references to we  us or our are references to cymer 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are the world s leading supplier of light source solutions for the semiconductor industry 
our products provide the essential light source for duv photolithography systems 
almost all consumer electronic devices manufactured in the last several years contain a semiconductor manufactured using light sources  such as ours 
we currently supply light sources to all three lithography tool manufacturers  asm lithography  canon  and nikon  who in turn supply their wafer steppers and scanners to chipmakers 
in addition  we sell replacement parts and services to the lithography tool manufacturers as well as directly to the chipmakers 
our light source systems currently constitute a substantial majority of all excimer light sources incorporated in lithography stepper and scanner tools 
a large portion of our revenue is derived from customers located outside of the united states 
in order to support our foreign customers and our installed base of light sources in foreign countries  we maintain a manufacturing and field service office in korea and field service and support offices in japan  singapore  the people s republic of china  the netherlands and taiwan 
we also maintain field service offices in the united states to service our installed base of light sources located in the united states 
since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from lithography tool manufacturers  we are subject to the volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical in nature and historically has experienced periodic ups and downs 
since  the final year of the last significant and prolonged peak in the cycle  the semiconductor industry experienced one of the longest downturns in its history from through late although this downturn negatively impacted our business and results of operations during  and  we were able to maintain our revenues at a relatively constant level and remain profitable during most of this three year period 
we are very conscious of the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry and make every effort to manage our business through the cycles such that we maintain our annual profitability during the downturn and take the necessary steps during the downturns to be strategically positioned for the next upturn 
during the extended downturn which occurred during through  we made several such strategic investments including the completion of our new manufacturing facilities in san diego and korea  the development and introduction of our new mopa technology and xl platform  on which all of our future duv light sources are planned to reside  and the ongoing work to improve business processes that leverage the overall efficiency of our workforce 
in the latter half of  there were several indicators that the extended downturn in the semiconductor industry  which started in  was coming to an end and that an upturn was in sight 
during the final months of  we experienced strong order growth and our direct customers announced increasing orders and extended delivery times 
in addition  the chipmakers utilization of our duv light sources exceeded the levels achieved in  the peak of the last extended upturn  and the mix of our light source models shipped shifted toward krf products  reflecting the chipmakers need for more capacity expansion 
in addition to the positive industry indicators  which we saw at the end of  we experienced much higher revenue levels and revenue growth from quarter to quarter during the first nine months of from the end of to the end of the third quarter of  our sequential quarter over quarter revenue growth ranged from to 
the combination of these four consecutive quarters of positive industry indicators  our own growing order momentum  and sequential quarterly record light source utilization levels across our installed base led us to believe that we were in an upturn 
however  during the third quarter of  though our business remained strong and we had received no net order push outs  many semiconductor and equipment companies issued warnings about potential shortfalls in revenue and earnings 
in september  the utilization rates of our light sources experienced the largest single monthly decline in our company s history 
starting in october  the reported decline in chip fab utilization caused some chipmakers to hold off on equipment purchases  including the purchase of lithography tools  and we received notification of light source push outs from our direct customers 
our light source system utilization rates at chipmakers continued to decline through the end of with the increasing uncertainty in the semiconductor industry  our ability to forecast the industry cycle became limited to less than one quarter 
due to these circumstances  in october  we took actions to deal effectively with what appeared to be a semiconductor industry slowdown the depth and duration of which we could not predict 
we aligned our cost structure accordingly with these uncertain conditions by reducing our overall expenses  and implementing a reduction in our workforce of approximately on october  since we were able to keep our headcount in line with the volume of our business during this most recent and brief upturn in  this headcount adjustment primarily reflected the change we anticipated in any volume production activities 
in addition  since approximately one third of the employees affected by this workforce reduction were temporary employees  we preserved our ability to ramp up production again quickly in response to any potential re acceleration of orders that might occur early in as ended  it seemed apparent that the long awaited upturn  although realized  had ended without reaching the full magnitude or duration of a normal upturn 
in spite of this  we had a number of noteworthy achievements during the year  including record total revenue of million for the year  record non systems revenue of million for the year  growing recognition of the benefits of the xl series products  and increasing adoption of these products  leading to record shipments in the fourth quarter of  with xl series products accounting for of shipments for the year  average selling prices  on a foreign currency adjusted basis  reaching  in the fourth quarter as a result of the product mix shifting toward arf products  the continued growth of our installed based of light source systems  which reached nearly  units by the end of  the successful subleasing  in the second half of  of the two san diego facilities we vacated in  which will result in reduced general and administrative expenses going forward  and the successful continuation of our efforts to reduce lead times and material costs for our xl series of products 
with visibility limited as we enter  the outlook for our industry cannot be predicted with accuracy 
we will continue to manage our expenses effectively while working to increase our operating efficiency 
we expect to introduce a significant number of new products and product features in to enhance our competitiveness  including two new arf light sources  one of which will be the xla  our third generation mopa product 
since we made significant investments in facilities and equipment during the last several years  we do not foresee a need for a high level of capital expenditures for some time in the future 
in  we plan to increase our management focus on improved asset management with particular emphasis on improving inventory management and turn rate  increasing operating efficiency  and ensuring the competitiveness of our product offerings 
we will be focusing our efforts in on generating a significant amount of cash and improving shareholder returns by achieving higher returns on assets  which includes increasing our inventory turns and return on invested capital during the year 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues product sales other total revenues cost and expenses cost of product sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets gain loss on debt extinguishment total costs and expenses operating income loss other expense net income loss before income tax provision benefit and minority interest income tax provision benefit minority interest net income loss gross margin on product sales critical accounting policies and estimates general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our ongoing internal processes  we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments associated with revenue recognition  valuation of parts used in our refurbishment manufacturing process  inventory allowances  warranty provisions  income taxes  allowances for bad debts  long lived assets valuation  intangible assets valuation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates and judgments upon historical information and other facts and assumptions that we believe to be valid and or reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions and facts form the basis for making judgments and estimates and for determining the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from our estimates if we were to use different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that revenue recognition  valuation of parts used in our refurbishment manufacturing process  inventory allowances  warranty provisions  and income taxes require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements than do other of our accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition our revenues consist of product sales  which include sales of light source systems  consumable and spare parts  upgrades  service  service contracts and training 
for a significant portion of our spare parts sales  our customers return the consumed assembly to us as part of the sale of a new part 
we reuse some of the material within these core assemblies  mainly metal components  for the future build of core assemblies 
as a result  our revenue consists of both cash and the value of the reusable parts received from our customers as consideration for these spare part sales 
our revenues also consist of other revenues  which include revenue from certain funded development activities performed for customers and under government contracts and license agreements 
we do not recognize any revenue for light source systems prior to shipment 
we test the systems in environments similar to those used by our customers prior to shipment to ensure that they meet the customers specifications and will interface with the customers software 
our installation obligations are perfunctory within the framework of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
the shipping terms vary by customer for light source systems shipments 
the majority of light source shipment terms are fob shipping point and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
for those customers with fob destination shipping terms  revenue is recognized upon delivery of the light source system to the customer 
one of our customers has an acceptance provision  which is satisfied by the issuance of an acceptance certificate following a visual inspection of the system by the customer 
we do not recognize revenue on systems shipped to that customer until we receive the acceptance certificate 
we have one arrangement where a portion of the light source system fee is not payable until the system is successfully installed at the end user 
in accordance with sab given the installation is not essential to the functionality of the system  we defer this portion of the fee until the system is installed 
revenue from consumables and spare parts sales is recognized at the point that legal title passes to the customer  which is generally upon shipment from our facility 
revenue associated with our customers return of core assemblies is recognized upon receipt of the returned core assembly 
the amount of the revenue is determined based upon the value of the reusable parts that we expect to yield from the returned core assembly returned 
service and training revenue is generally recognized at the time that the services are rendered or the training class is completed 
service contract revenues are generally recorded as revenue ratably over the life of the contract or per the specific terms of the agreement 
for funded development contracts  which are included in other revenue  funds received are accounted for on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
revenues generated from these types of funded development contracts are derived from cost sharing contracts between certain customers and us 
if milestones on these funded development contracts require that specific results be achieved or reported by us  revenue is not recognized until that milestone is completed 
for some of the funded development contracts that we enter into with customers and government agencies  we evaluate certain criteria to determine whether recording the funds received as revenue is appropriate 
if certain conditions are met  these funds are not recorded as revenue but rather are offset against our own internal research and development expenses in the period that the milestone is achieved or per the terms of the contract 
valuation of parts used in refurbishment manufacturing process and corrected accounting method over the last several years as part of our regular business activities  we have conducted significant parts refurbishment activities related to some of our core assemblies  in particular our chamber assemblies 
the volume of this activity significantly increased in these activities involve arrangements with our customers where we sell a new part to the customer at a reduced sales price if the customer returns the consumed assembly that the new part replaces 
these returned core assemblies contain a certain amount of material  primarily metal components  that may be reused by us in future core assemblies 
upon receipt of these consumed assemblies from our customers  we record an entry to recognize the estimated value of the reusable components as inventory and revenue 
the value of the reusable parts contained within the consumed assembly is determined based upon historical data on the value of the reusable parts that we typically yield from a consumed assembly 
the costs of refurbishment are also capitalized as part of ending inventory
