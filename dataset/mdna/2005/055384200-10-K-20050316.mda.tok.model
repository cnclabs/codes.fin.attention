see item legal proceedings for a discussion of litigation brought against us and benihana relating to our investment 
critical accounting policies management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently uncertain matters 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the statement of operations for the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  evaluation of goodwill for impairment  the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans  the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities in the application of the purchase method of accounting  the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the valuation of real estate held for development and equity method investments and accounting for contingencies 
the seven accounting policies that we have identified as critical accounting policies are i allowance for loan losses  ii valuation of securities as well as the determination of other than temporary declines in value  iii impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  iv impairment of long lived assets  v real estate held for development and sale and equity method investments  vi accounting for business combinations  and vii accounting for contingencies 
we have discussed the critical accounting estimates outlined below with our audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses bankatlantic is in the business of making various loans and as of december  bankatlantic s loans receivable were approximately billion and the related allowance for loan losses was approximately million 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount bankatlantic s considers adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in bankatlantic s loan portfolio 
bankatlantic has developed policies and procedures for evaluating its allowance for loan losses which consider all information available to them 
however  bankatlantic must rely on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown 
as a consequence  if circumstances change  the allowance for loan losses may decrease or increase significantly 
the calculation of allowance for loan losses consists of three components 
the first component requires the identification of identify impaired loans based on management judgment and  if necessary  the assignment of a valuation allowance to the impaired loans 
a loan is deemed impaired when collection of principal and interest based on the contractual terms of the loan is not likely to occur 
valuation allowances are established on loans that are collateral dependent and foreclosure is probable based on management s estimated fair value of the collateral less the cost to dispose of the collateral 
valuation allowances are established on other loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
these valuations are based on available information and require estimates and subjective judgments about fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows 
most of bankatlantic s loans do not have an observable market price and an estimate of the collection of contractual cash flows is based on the judgment of management 
it is likely that materially different results would be obtain if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
this would include updated information that came to management s attention about the loans or a change in the current economic environment 
as a consequence of the estimates and assumptions required to calculate the first component of allowance for loan losses  a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the second component of the allowance requires the grouping of loans that have similar credit risk characteristics so as to form a basis for predicting losses based on loss percentages and delinquency trends as it relates to the group 
management assigns an allowance to these groups of loans by utilizing data such as historical loss experiences  trends in the industry  static pool analysis  delinquency trends and credit scores 
a subsequent change in data trends may result in material changes in this 
table of contents component of the allowance from period to period 
the third component of the allowance is the unassigned portion of the allowance 
this component addresses certain industry and geographic concentrations  the view of regulators  model imprecision  change in underwriting standards and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
this component requires substantial management judgment in adjusting the allowance for the changes in the current economic climate compared to the economic environment that existed historically 
due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unassigned portion of the allowance  the relationship of the unassigned component to the total allowance may fluctuate substantially from period to period 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of incurred credit losses as of the statement of financial condition date 
as of december   bankatlantic s allowance for loan losses was million and bfc s allowance for loan losses was million 
see provision for loan losses for a discussion of the amounts of bankatlantic allowance assigned to each loan product and the amount of our unassigned allowance 
the estimated allowance derived from the above methodology may be significantly different from actual realized losses 
actual losses incurred in the future are highly dependent upon future events  including the economies of geographic areas in which we hold loans 
these uncertainties are beyond management s control 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review bankatlantic s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their examination 
on an on going basis  the loan portfolio is monitored based on the loan mix  credit quality  historical trends and economic conditions 
as a consequence  the allowance for loan losses estimates will change from period to period 
a measure of this change is the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans 
this ratio has declined from at december  to at december  if the historical loss experience in the assigned portion of the allowance for loan losses was increased or decreased by basis points at december   pre tax earnings before minority interest for the year ended december  are estimated to increase or decrease by approximately million and after minority interest at bfc s current proportionate share based on our interest in bankatlantic bancorp  net of income taxes to increase or decrease by approximately million 
valuation of securities and trading activities the securities referred to here do not include bfc s investments in bankatlantic bancorp or levitt 
bankatlantic records its securities available for sale  investment securities  trading securities and derivative instruments in our statement of financial condition at fair value 
the following three methods are used to determine fair value obtaining market price quotes  using a price matrix  and applying a management valuation model 
the following table provides the sources of fair value for investment securities  trading securities and derivative instruments at december  in thousands national market price price valuation quotes matrix model total investment securities mortgage backed securities tax exempt securities other securities equity securities total investment securities trading securities securities owned securities sold not yet purchased total trading securities derivatives total 
table of contents equity securities trade daily on various stock exchanges 
the fair value of these securities in our statement of financial condition was based on the closing price quotations at period end 
the closing quotation represents inter dealer quotations without retail markups  markdowns or commissions and do not necessarily represent actual transactions 
we adjust our equity securities available for sale to fair value monthly with a corresponding increase or decrease  net of income taxes  to other comprehensive income 
declines in the fair value of individual securities below their cost that are other than temporary result in write downs through charges to earnings of the individual securities to their fair value 
a third party service provides a pricing matrix to determine the fair value of debt securities available for sale 
the pricing matrix computes a fair value of debt securities based on the securities coupon rate  maturity date and estimates of future prepayment rates 
the valuations obtained from the pricing matrix are not actual transactions and will not be the actual amount realized upon sale 
it is likely that materially different results would be derived if different interest rate and prepayment assumptions were used in the valuation 
debt securities available for sale are adjusted to fair value monthly with a corresponding increase or decrease  net of income taxes  to other comprehensive income 
debt securities held to maturity are recorded at historical cost with the fair value disclosed on our statement of financial condition 
declines in the fair value of individual securities below their cost that are other than temporary result in write downs through charges to earnings of the individual securities to their fair value 
future contracts or commitments to purchase residential loans that are not listed on an exchange for which we cannot obtain broker quotes are nit available are valued based on a valuation model 
management estimates the valuation of these contracts based on market information 
this valuation requires a significant amount of judgment in assessing the estimated fair value 
these estimates would be significantly different if the assumptions concerning credit quality were changed 
at december   the fair value and unrealized gain associated with securities in our statement of financial condition was million and million  respectively 
if interest rates were to decline by basis points  we estimate that the fair value of the debt securities portfolio would increase by million 
in contrast  if interest rates were to increase by basis points  we estimate that the fair value of the securities would decline by million 
the above changes in value are based on various assumptions concerning prepayment rates and shifts in the interest rate yield curve and do not take into account any mitigating steps that management might take in response to changes in interest rates 
we are likely to obtain significantly different results if the assumptions were changed 
at december  in our statement of financial condition securities had a fair value of million and unrealized gains were million 
securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings 
the fair value of these securities is determined by obtaining security values from various sources  including dealer price quotations and price quotations for similar instruments traded and management estimates 
the majority of the securities owned are listed on national markets or market quotes can be obtained from brokers 
the fair values of securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are highly volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and changes in the market environment 
the most significant factors affecting the valuation of securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased is the lack of liquidity and credit quality of the issuer 
lack of liquidity results when trading in a position or a market sector has slowed significantly or ceased and quotes may not be available 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
the test requires the determination of the fair value of our reporting units and a comparison of the reporting units fair value to their carrying value 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using discounted cash flow present value techniques and management valuation models 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
these fair value estimates require a significant amount of judgment 
changes in management s valuation of its reporting units may affect future earnings through the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
at september  bankatlantic bancorp s goodwill impairment testing date the fair value of bankatlantic bancorp reporting units was greater than their carrying value  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
if the fair value of bankatlantic bancorp reporting units declines below the carrying amount  bankatlantic bancorp would have to perform the second step of the impairment test 
this step requires the determination of the fair value all assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
this allocation will include core deposit intangible assets that are currently not recognized on our financial statements 
these unrecognized assets may result in a significant impairment of goodwill 
at december   total goodwill at bankatlantic bancorp was million 
the fair value of bankatlantic bancorp s goodwill assigned to bank operations and ryan beck exceeds the carrying value by million and million  respectively 
table of contents the acquisition of bluegreen common stock in april resulted in approximately million of goodwill and the acquisition of bowden in april resulted in million of goodwill being recorded by levitt 
levitt performed its annual impairment test in december and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when testing a long lived asset for recoverability  it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation period 
changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows as well as evaluating estimated lives of long lived assets are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment 
a change in the estimated life of a long lived asset may substantially increase depreciation expense in subsequent periods 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  we are required to group long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other assets 
these cash flows are based on projections from management reports which are based on subjective interdepartmental allocations 
fair values are not available for many of our long lived assets  and estimates must be based on available information  including prices of similar assets and present value valuation techniques 
at december   total property and equipment was million  which includes from bankatlantic bancorp  and million from levitt 
bankatlantic bancorp core deposit intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at the branch level by reviewing the undiscounted cash flow by branch in order to assess recoverability 
at december   bankatlantic bancorp s core deposit intangible asset was million 
the undiscounted cash flows of the branches assigned to the core deposit intangible assets exceeded its carry amount at december  during  bankatlantic bancorp expects to relocate its new corporate headquarters 
at december  the facility was considered held and used  as defined by fasb statement no 
 with a book value of million 
based on a november appraisal  management believes the carrying value of the facility to be recoverable 
during  bankatlantic management finalized a plan to renovate the interior of bankatlantic s branches 
as a result of the renovation plan  bankatlantic shortened the estimated lives of million of branch fixed assets resulting in million of accelerated depreciation during in october  levitt purchased an occupied office building in fort lauderdale  florida for million that it intends to use as its executive offices upon termination or modification of the existing tenant lease 
accounting for business combinations the company and its subsidiaries accounts for business combinations  such as bankatlantic bancorp s community acquisition  ryan beck s gruntal transaction  levitt s bluegreen purchase and levitt s bowden acquisition based on the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires the acquirer to fair value the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the fair values are based on available information and current economic conditions at the date of acquisition 
the fair values may be obtained from independent appraisers  discounted cash flow present value techniques  management valuation models  quoted prices on national markets or quoted market prices from brokers 
these fair values estimates will affect future earnings through the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
such different fair value estimates could affect future earnings through different values being utilized for the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired 
real estate held for development and sale and equity method investments 
table of contents real estate held for development and sale consists primarily of the combined activities of levitt and its subsidiaries as well as the activities of a owned real estate joint venture in riverclub which bankatlantic bancorp is the primary beneficiary as defined by fin as a consequence of the implementation of fin on july   the company consolidated riverclub in its financial statements effective january  in periods prior to  riverclub was accounted for on the equity method 
also included in real estate held for development and sale is real estate held directly by bfc of approximately million at december   which includes burlington manufacturers outlet center  a shopping center in north carolina and the unsold land at the commercial development known as center port in pompano beach  florida 
at december   and  the combined balance of real estate held for development and sale and investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries were million  million and million  respectively 
real estate held for development and sale includes land acquisition costs  land development costs  interest and other construction costs  all of which are accounted for in our financial statements at accumulated cost or when circumstances indicate that the inventory is impaired at estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on disposition of real estate in the normal course of business under existing and anticipated market conditions 
the evaluation takes into consideration the current status of the property  various restrictions  carrying costs  costs of disposition and any other circumstances that may affect fair value  including management s plans for the property 
due to the large acreage of land holdings  disposition in the normal course of business is expected to extend over a number of years 
uncertainties associated with the economy  interest rates and the real estate market in general may significantly change the valuation of real estate investments 
land and indirect land development costs are accumulated and allocated to various parcels or housing units using specific identification and allocation based upon the relative sales value  unit or area methods 
direct construction costs are assigned to housing units based on specific identification 
other capitalized costs consist of capitalized interest  real estate taxes  tangible selling costs  local government fees and field overhead incurred during the development and construction period 
see capitalized interest  below 
start up costs and selling expenses are not capitalized 
our subsidiaries account for joint ventures using the equity method of accounting if they own at least of the voting stock or exercises significant influence over the operating and financial policies but do not own a controlling interest 
under the equity method  the initial investment in a joint venture is recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted to recognize the subsidiary s share of the joint venture s earnings or losses 
joint venture investments and levitt s investment in bluegreen are evaluated annually for other than temporary declines in value 
evidence of other than temporary declines includes the inability of the joint venture or investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment and consistent joint venture operating losses 
the evaluation is based on available information including condition of the property and current and anticipated real estate market conditions 
revenue recognition revenue and all related costs and expenses from home  land and commercial property sales are recognized at the time that closing has occurred  when title and possession of the property and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer  and when other sale and profit recognition criteria are satisfied as required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for real estate transactions 
in order to properly match revenues with expenses  construction and land development costs incurred but not paid at the time of closing are estimated 
estimated costs to complete are determined for each closed home and land sale based upon historical data with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
the accuracy of estimates is monitored by comparing actual costs incurred subsequent to closing to the estimate made at the time of closing and modifications to the estimates are made based on these comparisons 
the estimation process is not expected to change in the future nor are actual results expected to materially differ from such estimates 
capitalized interest interest incurred relating to land under development and construction is capitalized to real estate inventories during the active development period 
interest is capitalized as a component of inventory at the effective rates paid on borrowings during the pre construction and planning stage and during the periods that projects are under development 
capitalization of interest is discontinued if development ceases at a project 
interest is amortized to cost of sales as related homes  land and units are sold 
contingent liabilities 
table of contents contingent liabilities consist of ryan beck arbitration proceedings  litigation and regulatory and tax uncertainties arising from the conduct of our consolidated business activities 
reserves for legal and other claims are established when it becomes probable that a loss will be incurred and the loss is reasonably estimated 
attorneys  consultants and other professionals assess the probability of the estimated amounts 
changes in these assessments can lead to changes in the recorded reserves and the actual costs of resolving the claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for the claim 
the reserving for contingencies is based on management s judgment and changes in circumstances could significantly affect the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
bfc financial corporation summary of consolidated results of operations net income increased to million in from million in and million in included in these totals is income from discontinued operations of million and million for the years and  respectively  attributable to ryan beck s sale of gms 
additionally  in  the company realized an extraordinary gain of million associated with ryan beck s acquisition of the assets of gruntal because the fair value of the assets acquired exceeded the purchase price 
also in  the company realized a loss of million due to the initial implementation of fas relating to the goodwill impairment associated with bankatlantic bancorp s ownership of ryan beck in that bankatlantic bancorp performed the required goodwill impairment test and determined that the goodwill assigned to the ryan beck subsidiary was impaired

since the beginning of  bankatlantic has opened nearly  new checking and savings accounts  and the fourth quarter of marked the twelfth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in new low cost checking and savings account openings 
since january   total low cost deposits have increased from approximately million to approximately billion  an increase of 
non interest bearing demand deposits now constitute of deposit funding  up from last year and before initiation of the campaign 
these trends are expected to continue as bankatlantic increases its advertising expenditures  creates other marketing programs and maintain its commitment to superior customer service 
subject to changes in the interest rate environment  bankatlantic net interest income is expected to improve in during  the net interest margin  which we define as interest and dividend income minus interest expense 
was positively impacted by management s decision to prepay certain of its high rate fhlb advances in and although bankatlantic bancorp incurred pre payment penalties that decreased earnings in those periods  bankatlantic bancorp prepaid these fixed rate advances with the expectation that it would lower its funding costs and improve its interest margin in future periods 
bankatlantic s management believes the impact of this decision will be realized commencing in 

table of contents bankatlantic also believes that is florida s most convenient bank campaign will to decrease average cost of its deposit funding as balances of non interest bearing and other low cost deposits grow and constitute a larger percentage of total deposit funding 
bankatlantic credit quality continues to improve 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans declined to at year end 
in  bankatlantic had net recoveries of million vs 
net charge offs of million for and million for  and the associated ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average outstanding loans declined during each of these respective years to  and 
in addition to lower loan charge offs  in bankatlantic was successful in recovering and collecting loans in its commercial real estate loan and leasing portfolios that had been charged off 
however there is no assurance that bankatlantic will have similar success in future periods and higher net charge off ratios are expected 
bankatlantic s is emphasizing origination and purchase of loans collateralized by real estate  which have lower historical loss experiences than bankatlantic s discontinued loan products and non real estate loans  which has favorably impacted the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding 
since december   the ratio has declined from to at december  this trend  combined with net recoveries from loans charged offs during prior periods  necessitated a negative provision for loan losses of million in we believe that bankatlantic s credit ratios reflect the improving credit quality of its loans 
although significant changes in the quality of bankatlantic loan portfolio are not expected  we caution that changes in the local or national economy  or changes within certain industries  could have a dramatic impact on the performance of bankatlantic loans 
bankatlantic s other income continued to improve during  due primarily to increased fees associated with the additional new deposit accounts opened during the year 
bankatlantic expects to continue to experience an increase in other income during as bankatlantic continues its florida s most convenient bank initiatives and expands and renovates its branch network 
furthermore  the integration of the assets that were acquired from gruntal has enabled ryan beck to significantly increase its distribution capabilities and revenues since the latter half of the increase to over financial consultants enables the investment banking and trading lines of business to distribute their products to an increased account base of over  clients 
bankatlantic bancorp s expenses increased significantly during due primarily to the costs linked to bankatlantic marketing initiatives  including the hiring of new employees to service customers and advertising expenditures to promote bankatlantic s florida most convenient bank campaign 
our financial services division also incurred higher expenses associated with regulatory compliance and internal audit costs relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
bankatlantic bancorp believes that these expenses related to compliance will be less in than  but that expenses related to our marketing initiatives will continue to increase during as we continue to implement the florida s most convenient bank initiatives 
additionally  bankatlantic s branch expansion and renovation plans will also result in increased expenses

for the year ended december  compared to the same period interest and dividend income interest and dividend income in our financial services division decreased by million  or  from bankatlantic s interest income on average loans increased slightly as the small decline in average loan yields was offset by an increase in average loan balances 
the growth in balances primarily resulted from the origination of commercial real estate and home equity loans 
during  the bank originated over billion of corporate and commercial loans and over million of home equity loans 
beginning in july the prime rate of interest increased from to at december   while long term loan rates declined slightly from the december levels 
the increase in short term interest rates contributed to average loan yields only declining slightly from the prior period 
tax equivalent interest income on investment securities declined million  primarily due to a decline in the average balance of the investment portfolio 
maturities and prepayments on us agency obligations  primarily mortgage backed securities  were only partially replaced by purchases of new agency securities and purchases of tax exempt securities 
during  bankatlantic began investing in tax exempt securities as the yields on these securities were more attractive than alternative investments 
this decrease in bankatlantic interest income was partially offset with an increase of approximately  in interest on trading securities at ryan beck 
investment banking our financial services division investment banking revenue consists of investment banking revenue  principal transactions revenue and commission revenue at ryan beck 
investment banking revenue increased to million in from million in the improvement in investment banking revenue at ryan beck of approximately million in from was largely attributable to the increase in merger and acquisition and advisory business in in both the financial institutions group and the middle market investment banking group 
ryan beck s financial institutions group completed transactions during  versus during principal transactions decreased million from the period 
the decrease in principal transaction revenue was primarily the result of reductions in trading revenue associated with the firm s fixed income proprietary trading activity 
commission revenue increased million from the

table of contents during prior periods  bankatlantic discontinued the origination of syndication  lease financings and indirect consumer loans and made major modifications to the underwriting process for small business loans collectively  discontinued loan products 
the loans associated with the discontinued loan products gave rise to a significant portion of bankatlantic s net charge offs during each of the years in the three year period ended december  the decline in those portfolios during the past three years resulted in a reduction of bankatlantic s allowance for loan losses 
additionally  bankatlantic was able to realize net recoveries associated with previously charged off loans during the years ended december  and which favorably impacted the provision for loan losses 
the provision for recovery from loan losses improved in each of the years in the three year period ended december  this improvement resulted from several factors including the discontinuation of the loan products discussed above and changes made in bankatlantic s credit policies which focused bankatlantic s loan production on collateral based loans which historically have had lower loss experiences than other loan products 
the discontinued loan products accounted for approximately of net charge offs in the past five years 
in and  bankatlantic experienced noticeable benefits from its change in policy  as the balances and the associated losses in discontinued loan products declined  while bankatlantic experienced substantially lower losses from its loans originated under its new credit policy 
during  bankatlantic s loan provision was a recovery due to significant recoveries from discontinued loan products 
the majority of these recoveries were from bankruptcy settlements associated with syndication loans charged off in prior periods 
in  the recovery in loan losses primarily resulted from a million recovery of a residential construction loan that was charged off in  as well as continued net recoveries from bankatlantic discontinued loan products 
bankatlantic s total charge offs from continuing loan products during consisted of a  charge down of one commercial real estate loan and various smaller charges offs associated with small business  residential and consumer loans 
bankatlantic s total recoveries from continuing products during related primarily from its million recovery of the residential construction loan mentioned above 
bankatlantic s improvement in net charge offs during compared to resulted from commercial real estate loan charge offs during and lower discontinued loan product net charge offs during the commercial real estate loan charge offs during were associated with two loans

bankatlantic recorded a million allowance for loan losses in connection with the community savings acquisition in march the allowance amount represents the acquired allowance calculated based upon bankatlantic s methodology which was not significantly different than the allowance recorded by community at the acquisition date 
in  the acquired allowance for loan losses was reduced by  with a corresponding reduction in goodwill for loans acquired in connection with the community acquisition that had either matured or were prepaid and which had been assigned a valuation allowance

the allowance for commercial real estate loans increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase primarily reflects portfolio growth associated with high balance loans and additional reserves associated with loans to borrowers in the hospitality industry 
this industry was designated as having a higher credit risk than the other industries in bankatlantic s portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses to total gross loan percentages declined for each loan category during the three year period ended december   except for commercial business and discontinued loan products 
the decline reflects improving credit quality of the loan portfolio due  in part  to changes in bankatlantic s credit policies and procedures which began in the increase in the ratio for discontinued loan products reflects a high percentage of aviation leases due to lease repayments and charge offs in this portfolio 
aviation leases have a higher loss experience than other discontinued loan products 
commercial business allowance to gross loans percent increased due to an increase in the allowance for loans collateralized by time share properties during at december   bankatlantic s commercial real estate portfolio included several large lending relationships  including relationships with unaffiliated borrowers involving individual lending commitments in excess of million with an aggregate outstanding balance of billion 

table of contents the unassigned portion of the allowance for loan losses addresses certain individual industry conditions  general economic conditions and geographic concentration 
the major factors contributing to the increase in the unassigned allowance for loan losses during the past three years were the expanded geographical area in which bankatlantic originated commercial real estate loans  the growth in consumer and purchased residential loan portfolios and adverse economic trends associated with small business loans 
during  bankatlantic opened commercial loan offices in orlando and jacksonville  florida 
the loans originated outside bankatlantic s primary markets may have substantially different loss experiences than loans secured by collateral in south florida 
loans originated in commercial lending branch offices outside of south florida amounted to million at december  also contributing to bankatlantic s increase in the unassigned portion of the allowance during was the growth in bankatlantic s purchased residential and home equity loan products 
bankatlantic purchased billion of residential loans during of which were secured by properties located in california  many of which were hybrid loans with interest only payments for a period of three to ten years  followed by conversion to a fully amortizing loan at the then prevailing interest rates for the remaining term of the loan 
these types of delayed amortizing loans may have a greater default or recovery risk than existing traditional amortizing loans in our portfolio 
during  bankatlantic modified its underwriting policies to allow for higher loan to value ratios based on beacon scores for home equity loans  and bankatlantic originated approximately million of home equity loans during primarily in its south florida market 
the charge offs for home equity loans in the southeastern united states during the four quarters ended september  exceeded all other regions in the country 
additionally  the southeastern united states losses on non real estate secured small business loans were more than double any other region in the country during the last six months of these types of loans generally have a higher degree of credit risk than other loans in bankatlantic s portfolio as repayment is dependent on the success of the business  many of which are relatively newer businesses without an established operating history or are family owned firms

the amount represents one loan that was repaid during february 
table of contents non performing assets significantly declined at december  and compared to the prior years 
bankatlantic believes that the reduction in non performing assets was attributable to the strengthening of bankatlantic s underwriting policies by focusing its loan production on collateral based loans as well as discontinuing the origination of loan products with high historical loss experiences 
in  non accrual assets improved primarily due to lower residential non performing loans  delinquent tax certificates and real estate owned balances in bankatlantic s portfolio  resulting from favorable economic conditions in the real estate industry 
the improvement in non performing assets was partially offset by higher non accrual lease financing lending arrangements in the aviation industry and higher non accruing home equity loans 
the specific valuation allowances on non performing assets at december   and consisted of specific valuation allowances on non performing loans 
at each period end  bankatlantic individually evaluates the non homogenous loans in its portfolio as to which it deems probable that the borrower will be unable to meet the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
a specific valuation allowance is established for these loans  primarily based on cash flow valuation models 
at year end and  there were no specific valuation allowances assigned to non performing loans  as the present values of the expected cash flows was in excess of the carrying amount of the non homogenous  non performing loans 
the decline in potential problem assets at december  compared to the prior year was due to a lease in the aviation industry transferring to a non accrual status and subsequently charged down by  other expenses compensation and benefit expenses increased in in addition to standard annual employee salary increases  the growth in this expense category primarily resulted from the number of full time equivalent bankatlantic employees increased to  at year end versus  at year end and  at year end in  employees were added as a result of the community acquisition 
the remainder of personnel growth during the past three years primarily related to the additional personnel required to implement bankatlantic s commitment to provide extended banking hours and high service levels to the increased number of bankatlantic customers resulting from the florida s most convenient bank campaign 
in addition to the increase in the number of employees  the cost of bankatlantic bancorp regular benefit programs also increased  primarily due to rising health insurance costs 
approximately million in bonuses were paid in to employees of bankatlantic for exceeding targeted performance goals  versus million in and zero in an increase in ryan beck s employee compensation and benefits of from primarily due to the increase in the firm s bonuses which is correlated to the increased investment banking revenues and the increase in ryan beck s revenues from in  occupancy and equipment expenses increased from during the year  bankatlantic adopted a plan to renovate all of its existing branches with a goal to have a consistent look or brand 
management of bankatlantic anticipates that the renovation plan will be complete in this resulted in the accelerated depreciation of million of fixed assets and leasehold improvements that are scheduled to be replaced 
these items are being depreciated over their remaining useful life 
also in  florida experienced unprecedented hurricane activity  and repair and maintenance expenses increased approximately primarily as a result of damage to facilities and equipment 
additionally  as a result of extended weekend and weekday store hours associated with the florida s most convenient bank initiative  guard service expense increased over as bankatlantic provided added security 
additional increases in occupancy and equipment were primarily due to ryan beck s additional offices opened in and the leasing of back office space associated with the relocation of ryan beck s corporate headquarters 
advertising expenses during and reflect marketing initiatives to promote bankatlantic s high performance account products and bankatlantic s florida s most convenient bank initiatives 
these promotions included print  radio and billboard advertising  periodic customer gifts and events associated with seven day banking 
advertising and promotion expense at ryan beck increased approximately million primarily due to expenses associated with the launch of ryan beck s first formal advertising campaign designed to expand ryan beck s exposure through print and television media 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets consisted of the amortization of core deposit intangible assets acquired in connection with the community acquisition 
the core deposit intangible assets are being amortized over an estimated life of ten years 
costs associated with debt redemption resulted from the prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of million of fhlb advances in and million of advances in bankatlantic bancorp prepaid these high rate advances with the expectation that it would improve bankatlantic s net interest margin in future periods 
the decrease in other expenses in our financial services division for year ended december   compared to the same period  primarily resulted from decreases in communication costs at ryan beck 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in floor broker clearing fees at ryan beck  higher professional fees at bankatlantic and other expenses 
the higher expenses for professional fees in  compared to  resulted from deficiencies that were identified in the bank s compliance with anti terrorism and anti money laundering laws and regulations 
bankatlantic is seeking to s correct the identified deficiencies in its compliance with the usa patriot act  anti money laundering laws and the bank secrecy act  and bankatlantic has been cooperating with regulators and other federal agencies concerning those deficiencies 
bankatlantic has incurred substantial costs to improve its compliance systems and procedures  including costs associated with engaging attorneys and compliance consultants  acquiring new software and hiring additional compliance staff 
compliance costs in were approximately million 
these compliance related costs were primarily one time and are not expected to recur at these levels in however  on going costs will be higher than prior periods by an estimated million annually 
the increase in professional fees at bankatlantic were partially offset with decreases in professional fees at ryan beck primarily due to legal settlements reached in  including the settlement of the former gruntal bankruptcy matter  which resulted in a decrease in ryan beck s legal reserve for offsetting this decrease is the increase in professional fees associated with higher internal audit costs related to ryan beck s compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the decrease in ryan beck communications and other expenses from related primarily to decreased communication costs due to the elimination of duplicate vendors and services carried as a result of the gruntal transaction 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period interest and dividend income interest and dividend income decreased by million  or  from as a consequence of lower average yields on earning assets and a slight increase in average earning asset balances  interest income decreased by million 
the decline reflects a substantial decrease in yields on earning assets partially offset by lower rates on interest bearing liabilities resulting in a basis point decline in our net interest margin 
the net interest margin was negatively impacted by the historically low interest rates during and high rates associated with bankatlantic s advances from the fhlb 
the yield on the year treasury bond declined from approximately in early to almost in mid for most of  the prime rate stood at 
the prime rate declined to in november and declined again to in june short term libor and treasury based indices also declined during this period  leading to less interest income earned on adjustable rate loans and investments 
additionally  this low interest rate environment resulted in accelerated prepayments of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as homeowners took advantage of the refinancing opportunities 
bankatlantic experienced accelerated amortization of premiums associated with some of these assets  and bankatlantic was faced with investing the proceeds from these repayments primarily in residential and commercial loans at lower yields 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest on trading securities at ryan beck  which primarily resulted from the expansion of municipal bond trading and the associated spread between the interest on the municipal bonds and the financing costs incurred 
also included in interest income was ryan beck s participation in interest income associated with approximately million of customer margin debit balances and fees earned in connection with approximately billion in customer money market account balances 

table of contents investment banking investment banking revenue increased by million or from investment banking revenue consists of investment banking revenue  principal transaction revenue and commission revenue at ryan beck

additionally during  bankatlantic bancorp securities activities include a gain of approximately  from a liquidating dividend from an equity security and in included the sale of million equity securities 
interest expense  net the significant factors resulting in the decline in interest expense were a substantial reduction in bankatlantic s deposit interest expense due to low cost deposit growth  interest on advances from fhlb advances and decreased interest expense on short term borrowings 
rates on interest bearing liabilities did not decline as rapidly as rates on interest earning assets because of average interest bearing liabilities consisted of long term advances from the fhlb that  either directly or indirectly via interest rate swaps  had fixed interest rates 
these advances were originated in order to fund the purchase of fixed rate residential loans 
however  in september bankatlantic repaid million of these advances and in december bankatlantic repaid an additional million of these advances 
the advances repaid had an average rate of 
expenses of million were recognized in connection with these prepayments and a million loss was recognized on the termination of interest rate swap contracts

the increase in ryan beck s revenue correlates to an increase in compensation in the form of commission expense and discretionary bonuses 
in  occupancy and equipment expenses decreased as compared to the year ended december  this decline primarily resulted from lower data processing costs and depreciation expense 
lower data processing expenses resulted from the renewal of a vendor contract at significantly lower rates than experienced during the prior period

the key financial measures utilized to evaluate historical operating performance include revenues from sales of real estate  cost of sales of real estate  margin which is measured as revenues from sales of real estate minus cost of sales of real estate  margin percentage which is measured as margin divided by revenues from sales of real estate  income before taxes and net income 
non financial measures used to evaluate historical performance include the number and value of new orders executed  the number of housing starts and the number of homes delivered 
in evaluating levitt s future prospects  management considers non financial information such as the number of homes and acres in backlog which is measured as homes or land subject to an executed sales contract and the aggregate value of those contracts 
additionally  levitt monitors the number of properties remaining in inventory and under contract to be purchased relative to its sales and construction trends 
levitt s ratio of debt to its shareholders equity and cash requirements are also considered by management when evaluating levitt s future prospects  as are general economic factors and interest rate trends 
the list of measures above is not an exhaustive list  and management may from time to time utilize additional financial and non financial information or may not use the measures listed above 
at december   levitt s homebuilding division had a delivery backlog of  homes representing million of future sales 
the average sales price of the homes in backlog at december  was approximately higher than the average sales price of the homes in backlog at december  while the strong demand and backlog are encouraging for our results  adverse economic trends such as rising interest rates  continued inflationary pressures or labor or material shortages could impact levitt s homebuilding division in future periods 
in the costs of lumber  steel  concrete and other building materials rose significantly 
additionally  labor costs rose reflecting a shortage of sub contractors in some of the markets in which we build 
the redeployment of labor in florida following the hurricanes exacerbated the labor shortage in these markets 
while levitt may be able to increase its selling prices to absorb these 
table of contents increased costs in future sales  the sales prices of homes in levitt s backlog cannot be increased and the margins on the delivery of homes in backlog may be adversely affected by these factors 
levitt believes that it owns or controls sufficient land to meet its current growth goals 
in the shorter term  levitt expects the number of signed new orders for homes in florida operations to level off and perhaps decline slightly through the first quarter of as levitt transitions from the older  established communities at which sales are reaching completion to new communities that levitt expect will open for sale to the public in the next three to months 
if levitt is not able to open new communities in a timely fashion  levitt s available inventory will remain below historical levels and levitt s results will be adversely impacted 
levitt s sales performance in florida over the past eighteen months exceeded its projections  as a result  levitt is currently focused on building homes to meet the month delivery time frame projected by levitt at the time of sale 
levitt believes that active growth management will permit it to increase customer satisfaction and reduce the amount of time contracted homes are in backlog  thereby reducing its exposure to rising costs 
levitt is also currently expanding its homebuilding activities to the jacksonville  florida  atlanta  georgia and nashville  tennessee markets 
levitt has not previously operated in these markets and may not recognize any revenues from these operations during the next twelve months or longer 
as a result  any costs associated with this expansion prior to revenue recognition may adversely affect levitt s operating results 
impact of florida hurricanes in the majority of levitt s business operations are located in the state of florida  which is subject to hurricanes and other tropical weather systems 
in the months of august and september  five named storms made landfall in the state of florida tropical storm bonnie and hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
hurricane charley passed through the southwestern and central areas of florida  including areas where levitt has significant homebuilding operations ft 
myers  sarasota and orlando 
hurricanes frances and jeanne both made landfall on the east coast of the state near levitt s st 
lucie county homebuilding and land development operations before passing to the northwest over orlando 
these three hurricanes caused property damage in several of levitt s communities under development in central florida  and levitt has expended considerable resources repairing both homes under construction and previously delivered homes  repairing stucco  replacing insulation and dry wall as well as other materials damaged in the storms 
levitt has also expended funds to mitigate other hurricane related damage  including replacing landscaping and fences  repairing lake beds and replacing building materials 
levitt s income from continuing operations for the year ended december  include charges  recorded as other expenses  related to hurricane damage and repairs of approximately million  net of projected insurance recoveries 
in addition to property damage  hurricanes cause disruptions to levitt s business operations 
new home buyers cannot obtain insurance until after named storms have passed  creating delays in new home deliveries 
as a storm approaches  levitt will suspend sales  development and construction operations be suspended in favor of storm preparation activities such as securing construction materials and equipment 
after a storm has passed  construction related resources such as sub contracted labor and building materials are likely to be redeployed to hurricane recovery efforts around the state 
governmental permitting and inspection activities may similarly be focused primarily on returning displaced residents to homes damaged by the storms  rather than on new construction activity 
depending on the severity of the damage caused by the storms  disruptions such as these could last for several months 
levitt has experienced a number of these disruptions following the unprecedented series of hurricanes which struck florida in  including permitting and delivery delays  reduced customer orders and labor and materials constraints 
although the disruptions are not expected to have a material impact on the profitability of levitt s operations over the long term  levitt expects the delays in new home deliveries and governmental permitting and inspection activities resulting from the hurricanes to continue through the first quarter of impact of materials costs  interest rates and local government regulation levitt s operations are impacted by competition for labor direct and subcontracted labor  raw materials  supply and delivery issues 
throughout  supply and delivery issues resulted in higher prices of most building materials 
the costs of lumber  steel  concrete  asphalt and other building materials all rose significantly in levitt and its subsidiaries also compete with other real estate developers regionally  nationally and globally for raw materials and labor 
labor shortages were particularly acute in central florida following the hurricane season  home builders were obliged to compete with businesses  municipalities and existing homeowners for the available labor  much of which was diverted to hurricane clean up and repair of windstorm and wind driven rain damage 
in addition  chinese demand for cement combined with supply bottlenecks and rising prices in global shipping have contributed to regional shortages in cement in without corresponding increases in the sales prices of levitt s real estate inventories both land and finished homes  increasing materials costs associated with land development and home building could negatively affect levitt s results of operations 

table of contents rising construction costs and delays in the delivery of homes may negatively affect margins in the future  because levitt enters into fixed priced sales contracts for most of levitt s homes 
owing to the strong demand for housing products and the overall robust condition of the real estate markets where levitt builds  levitt has historically been able to offset increases in construction costs and land prices by periodically raising the prices on its homes 
however  if levitt is unable to raise its home prices to offset increased costs of production in the future  levitt s operating results would be adversely affected 
levitt relies on third party financing of its land purchases  land development  and product development costs 
the majority of levitt s financing consists of variable rate debt and rising interest rates therefore increase levitt s borrowing costs 
historically  rising interest rates have also negatively impacted housing demand 
were demand for housing to decline  land may remain in our inventory longer and levitt s corresponding borrowing costs would increase 
also  rising interest rates increase the mortgage costs of our customers who finance their purchases of levitt s homes 
similarly  rising interest rates may affect our customers ability to sell the homes they currently occupy  the proceeds of which may be needed to fund  in whole or in part  their purchases of our homes 
although levitt is not currently experiencing any adverse effects from higher interest rates  higher rates may adversely affect levitt s results of operations in the future 
levitt is required to obtain various permitting approvals of numerous governmental authorities in developing a project and building homes 
local governments have in the past difficulty responding to the rapid growth and continued demand for land and housing in the real estate markets in which levitt operates  resulting in delays in permitting approvals 
in some areas where levitt builds and develops land  local governments have refused to issue building permits until all infrastructure and land development is substantially complete 
the inability to obtain building permits during early stage development prevents homebuilders from conducting land development simultaneous with housing construction  contributing in some instances to longer production cycles 
in the aftermath of the florida hurricanes  the demands on local government were intensified as government staff mobilized to support construction repairs  restore basic community services and emergency relief 
delays in permitting approvals will affect levitt s business and may affect levitt s results of operations in the future

the above acres  revenues and margin in include sales to levitt s homebuilding division 
accordingly approximately acres  million in revenue and million in margin were eliminated in levitt s consolidation and the profit recognized by the land division from these sales will be deferred until the homebuilding division delivers homes on these properties to third parties

impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  except as otherwise noted and in those instances reconciled to the generally accepted accounting treatment of the financial measurement under discussion  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature by virtue of our ownership in bankatlantic bancorp 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general price levels 
although interest rates generally move in the same direction as inflation  the magnitude of such changes varies 
the possible effect of fluctuating interest rates is discussed more fully under the section entitled consolidated interest rate risk in item a below 
with respect to our real estate activities  primarily the activities of our subsidiary levitt corporation  inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
rising interest rates  as well as increased materials and labor costs may reduce gross margins 
in recent years  the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and historically have not had a significant adverse impact on us 
in addition  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations

 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to state that the guidance for a incidental operations and b costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time sharing transactions 
the accounting for those operations and costs is subject to the guidance in sop this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  bluegreen has indicated in its periodic reports filed with the sec that this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on bluegreen s financial statements 
accordingly  management believes that this statement will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the eitf provides guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under fasb statement no 
and investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
the guidance of eitf requires that the company make evidence based judgments about the recovery of the unrealized loss impairment  if any  on each security considering the severity and duration of the impairment and the company s ability and intent to hold the securities until the forecasted recovery 
in september the fasb issued a fsp that delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance for the meaning of other than temporary impairment 
the disclosure requirements were not deferred 
at december   the securities portfolios were evaluated for other than temporary declines in value based on existing guidance contained in fasb no 
 sab topic m and fasb staff implementation guide to fasb no 
resulting in approximately  in other than temporary impairment of the securities portfolios 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa accounting standards executive committee acsec issued statement of position sop 
the sop addresses accounting for loans and debt securities acquired in purchase business combinations or purchased subsequent to origination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination 
the sop prohibits the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired that meet the criteria of the sop 
the sop does not apply to originated loans 
the sop limits the yield that may be accreted to the excess of the purchaser s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows over the purchaser s initial investment 
the sop requires excess contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected to not be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as impairments 
the sop is effective for loans and securities acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption encouraged 
upon adoption as of january   the sop did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk consolidated market risk market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market valuations which arise from interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and equity price risk 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk and our secondary market risk is equity price risk 
consolidated interest rate risk the majority of bankatlantic s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  subjecting bankatlantic to significant interest rate risk in that their value fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
bankatlantic bancorp has developed a model using standard industry software to quantify its interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis was performed by bankatlantic to measure its potential gains and losses in net portfolio fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments at december  resulting from a change in interest rates 
interest rate sensitive instruments included in the model are loans  debt securities available for sale  investment securities  fhlb stock  federal funds sold  deposits  advances from fhlb  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds purchased  subordinated debentures  notes and bonds payable  forward contracts  junior subordinated debentures  and off balance sheet loan commitments 
the model calculates the net potential gains and losses in net portfolio fair value by i 
discounting anticipated cash flows from existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts and derivatives at market rates to determine fair values at december   ii 
discounting the above expected cash flows based on instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve to determine fair values  and iii 
calculating the difference between the fair value calculated in i and ii 
management of bankatlantic has made estimates of fair value discount rates that it believes to be reasonable 
however  because there is no quoted market for many of these financial instruments  management of bankatlantic has no basis to determine whether the fair value presented would be indicative of the value that could be attained in an actual sale 
bankatlantic s fair value estimates do not consider the tax effect that would be associated with the disposition of the assets or liabilities at their fair value estimates 
subordinated debentures and mortgage backed bonds payable were valued for this purpose based on their contractual maturities or redemption date 
bankatlantic s interest rate risk policy has been approved by its board of directors and establishes guidelines for tolerance levels for net portfolio value changes based on interest rate volatility 
management of bankatlantic has maintained the portfolio within these established tolerances 
certain assumptions in assessing the interest rate risk were utilized in preparing the following table 
these assumptions related to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  market values of certain assets under various interest rate scenarios  and 
table of contents re pricing of certain borrowings 
the prepayment assumptions used in the model are a portfolio composition of fixed rate mortgages fixed rate securities tax certificates adjustable rate mortgages adjustable rate securities deposit runoff assumptions used in the model are as follows within over year years years years money fund savings accounts decay rates now and savings accounts decay rates the tables below measure changes in net portfolio value for instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve in basis point increments up or down 
it was also assumed that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this would be the case 
even if interest rates change in the designated increments  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as indicated in the table above 
in addition  a change in us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the yield curve could cause significantly different changes to the fair values than indicated above 
furthermore  the results of the calculations in the preceding table are subject to significant deviations based upon actual future events  including anticipatory and reactive measures which we may take in the future 
presented below is an analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on bankatlantic s net portfolio value at december  dollars in thousands changes in rate net portfolio value amount dollar change bp bp bp bp presented below is an analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on bankatlantic s net portfolio value at december  dollars in thousands changes in rate net portfolio value amount dollar change bp bp bp bp levitt is also subject to interest rate risk on its long term debt 
at december   levitt had million in borrowings with adjustable rates tied to the prime rate and or the london interbank offered rate libor and million in borrowings with fixed rates 
at december   included in the million is approximately million in borrowings due to bankatlantic and million in borrowings due to bankatlantic bancorp which are eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
consequently  for debt tied to an indexed rate  changes in interest rates may 
table of contents affect earnings and cash flows  but generally would not impact the fair value of such debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt  but not earnings or cash flow 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase interest incurred by approximately million per year 
interest rate sensitivity changes in interest rates can impact our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities  as the relative spreads between our assets and our liabilities can widen or narrow due to changes in the overall levels of and changes in market interest rates 
bankatlantic bancorp s profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
changes in market interest rates  changes in the relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
this difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income 
while bankatlantic bancorp has attempted to structure its asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income of changes in market interest rates  such strategy may not be successful 
generally  as interest rates fall  loan prepayments accelerate 
prepayments in a declining interest rate environment reduce net interest income and adversely impact earnings due to accelerated amortization of loan premiums and the reinvestment of proceeds from these loan payoffs at lower rates 
significant loan prepayments in bankatlantic bancorp s purchased residential loan portfolio in the future could have an adverse effect on future earnings 
also  since bfc seeks to make appropriate and profitable additional investments and acquisitions  interest rates can and will affect the market and price for such investment and acquisitions 
moreover  bfc has in the past and intends to in the future finance in part future acquisitions by the issuance of debt at the parent and subsidiary level and  therefore  interest rates will affect the cost and availability of such credit 
equity price risk the portfolio of equity securities and exchange traded mutual funds held by the consolidated entities are subject to equity pricing risks which would arise as the relative values of the equity investments change in conjunction with market or economic conditions 
the change in fair values of equity investments represents instantaneous changes in all equity prices 
the following are hypothetical changes in the fair value of available for sale securities at december  based on percentage changes in fair value 
actual future price appreciation or depreciation may be different from the changes identified in the table below dollars in thousands 
percent change in fair value available for sale securities fair value dollar change 
table of contents excluded from the above table is ryan beck s securities assets which are discussed below  million of investments in other financial institutions held by bankatlantic bancorp and million invested by bankatlantic bancorp in a limited partnership for which no current liquid market exists 
also  excluded from the above table is  in investments in private companies held by bfc and a million investment in benihana held by bfc for which no current market is available 
the ability to realize on or liquidate these investments will depend on future market conditions and is subject to significant risk 
ryan beck market risk ryan beck s market risk is the potential change in value of financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  credit spreads or other market forces 
the company  through its broker dealer subsidiary ryan beck  is exposed to market risk arising from trading and market making activities 
ryan beck s management monitors risk in its trading activities by establishing limits and reviewing daily trading results  inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
ryan beck uses a variety of tools  including aggregate and statistical methods 
value at risk  var is the principal statistical method and measures the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
ryan beck began using var on january  substantially all the trading inventory is subject to measurement using var 
ryan beck uses an historical simulation approach to measuring var using a confidence level  a one day holding period and the most recent three months average volatility 
the var means that  on average  one would not expect to exceed such loss amount more than one time every one hundred trading days if the portfolio were held constant for a one day period 
modeling and statistical methods rely on approximations and assumptions that could be significant under certain circumstances 
as such  the risk management process also employs other methods such as sensitivity to interest rates and stress testing 
the following table sets forth the high  low and average var for ryan beck for the year ended december  in thousands high low average var aggregate long value aggregate short value the following table sets forth the high  low and average var for ryan beck during the period january  to december   and adjusted for discontinued operations 
in thousands high low average var aggregate long value aggregate short value bfc investment risk because bankatlantic bancorp and levitt are consolidated in the company s financial statements an increase or decrease in the market price of their stock would not impact the financial statements 
however  a significant change in the market price of either of these securities would likely have an effect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of bfc s common stock and of bfc s directly held equity securities are important to the valuation and financing capability of bfc  both of which are important variables concerning whether bfc can continue to successfully implement its strategy of investing in and acquiring operating businesses in diverse industries
