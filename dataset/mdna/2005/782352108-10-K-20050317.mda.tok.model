item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general today  russell corporation is a major branded athletic and sporting goods company with a rich history of marketing athletic uniforms  apparel and equipment for a wide variety of sports and fitness activities 
its global position is built on well known brands and quality products 
with established brands such as russell athletic  jerzees  spalding  and brooks  we have products to meet the needs of everyone  from the serious athlete to the weekend warrior 
other brands include american athletic  huffy sports  mossy oak  cross creek  moving comfort  bike  dudley  discus  and sherrin 
founded in  russell started on a small scale with a few pieces of equipment and a small building 
as the company grew  it became a pioneer in the athletic team uniform business and one of the first companies to produce the most popular athletic product of all the sweatshirt 
in  major restructuring efforts began the transitioning of the company from a vertical manufacturing driven company with the majority of its production in the us  to a customer and consumer driven apparel company 
over the next three years  we moved away from ownership of certain textile operations yarn spinning while successfully shifting the majority of our apparel operations sewing to lower cost offshore facilities  primarily mexico and central america 
in october  we announced an operational improvement program oip targeting million in cost reductions to offset anticipated selling price decreases  higher fiber costs and other cost increases for fiscal during  we increased the targeted savings of that program to million 
that plan included improving operating efficiencies and asset utilization  while streamlining processes in both our manufacturing and administrative areas such as lower full packaged sourcing costs  increased efficiencies in textile dyeing and finishing operations  improved distribution costs  and expanded production with lower cost contractors in haiti 
as part of the oip  we eliminated approximately positions in  primarily salaried and administrative office staff  and incurred asset impairment charges associated with the closings of two international sales offices and a previously idled domestic finished goods warehouse 
in addition to the oip  we have a new textile plant for both t shirt and fleece production under construction in honduras 
once fully operational in  the merendon plant is expected to generate approximately million to million in cost savings versus the costs at the time the project was initiated 
also  we eliminated approximately another salaried and administrative office staff positions in during and  we made five strategic acquisitions to further advance our position in the sports equipment business 
on february   we acquired the majority of the assets of bike athletic company bike which introduced athletic supporters  knee and elbow pads  braces  and protective equipment into our product offering 
on may   we acquired assets of spalding sports worldwide  inc spalding making us a leading marketer of basketballs and softballs  also selling footballs  soccer balls  and volleyballs 
on june   we acquired the net assets of american athletic  inc aai  a leader in the gymnastics equipment business  but as important to us  provided spalding a platform for extension into the basketball backboard and backboard systems business 
on july   we acquired certain assets  and assumed certain liabilities  of huffy sports from huffy corporation  further expanding our basketball backboard  backboard systems and accessories business 
aai and huffy sports are now part of our spalding operations 
on december   we entered the athletic footwear business with the acquisition of the brooks sports business brooks 
brooks is a pioneer in the technical footwear industry  and its technical apparel is highly valued in the world of serious runners 
our moving comfort brand also holds a strong position in running and fitness with its performance apparel designed especially for women 
typically  demand for our apparel products is higher during the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year 
weather conditions also affect the demand for our apparel products  particularly for our fleece sweatshirts and sweatpants products 
generally  we produce  source and store finished goods inventory  particularly fleece  to meet the expected demand for delivery in the upcoming season 
demand for our basketball and basketball equipment business is typically higher in the second and fourth quarters  but its seasonal pattern is not as pronounced as the fleece business 
components and complete basketball systems may be sourced  with some assembly performed at our operations in the us all of our inflatables basketballs  footballs  volleyballs  soccer balls  etc 
are manufactured overseas 
likewise  we expect demand for our newest acquisition  brooks  our athletic footwear and running equipment brand  to be slightly higher in the first half of each year 
brooks sources of its production  primarily from various suppliers in china 

table of contents while product mix affects our overall gross profit  operating profit is similar among products and across our various brands and distribution channels 
in cases where we manufacture products  plant utilization levels are important to our profitability because a substantial portion of our total production cost is fixed 
we operate our business in two segments domestic and international apparel 
the domestic segment is further aligned by brands 
the two brand groupings in the domestic segment are athletic and activewear 
the operating results of bike  spalding  aai  huffy sports and brooks have been included in our consolidated financial statements  as part of the domestic segment  since their respective acquisition dates 
the international apparel segment generally distributes similar athletic  outdoor and activewear apparel products 

table of contents critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  long lived assets  deferred income taxes  restructuring reserves  pension benefits  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that some of our accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies 
we have identified the policies below that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our business operations and their associated risks are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of russell corporation  all of our majority owned subsidiaries  and any variable interest entities in which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation of fin fin r  which supersedes fin and clarifies certain aspects of fin fin r addresses whether business enterprises must consolidate the financial statements of entities known as variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is defined by fin r to be a business entity which has one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  and the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for risk of absorbing expected losses 
under fin r  the party with an ownership  contractual or other financial interest that absorbs the majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses  or is entitled to receive a majority of the residual returns  or both  is deemed to be the primary beneficiary  and is required to consolidate the variable interest entity s assets  liabilities and non controlling interests 
we performed a review of all of our ownership and contractual interests in entities including frontier yarns 
we have determined that frontier yarns meets the criteria for being a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
in accordance with fin r  we began consolidating frontier yarns on april  at january   the consolidation of frontier yarns increased our total assets by million  total liabilities by million and non controlling interests by million 
the consolidation of frontier yarns did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues  net of estimated sales returns  discounts and allowances  when goods are shipped  title has passed  the sales price is fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
substantially all of our sales reflect fob shipping point terms 
we record provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances on sales in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo data  specific notification of pending returns  and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  net sales could either be understated or overstated 
trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable consist of amounts due from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect expected credit losses 
we provide for bad debts based on collection history and specific risks identified on a customer by customer basis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of accounts receivable and the creditworthiness of each customer 
furthermore  these judgments must be continually evaluated and updated 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate causing an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for bad debts may be required in future periods 
on the other hand  if our ultimate recovery on the accounts we have reserved or written off exceeds our estimates  we may need to decrease our reserves in the future 
inventories 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost for the majority of our inventories determined under the last in  first out lifo method 
we apply the lower of cost or market principle to lifo inventories in the aggregate  rather than to individual stock keeping units sku s  because it is not practical to establish the lifo cost of an individual sku 
for the remainder of our inventory that is accounted for under the first in  first out fifo method  we write down individual sku s that become 
table of contents obsolete and unmarketable to their estimated net realizable value based upon  among other things  assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in  our pre tax income was unfavorably impacted by million due to the liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at higher costs prevailing in prior years as compared with current manufacturing costs 
there was no significant impact on pre tax income from the liquidation of lifo inventory quantities in and income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured at the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the taxes are expected to be paid 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is likely to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will make an adjustment to increase our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and that adjustment will be charged to income in the period that we make the determination 
likewise  if we determine that we will be able to realize more of our deferred tax assets than we currently expect  we will adjust our deferred tax assets  which will have the effect of increasing net income in the period that we make the determination 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the lives of the assets 
we estimate the depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment based on the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us 
we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
most of our property  plant and equipment are employed in integrated manufacturing and distribution processes 
accordingly  we ordinarily cannot assess impairment of assets held for use at the individual asset level  but rather we aggregate them into logical groups for purposes of testing whether they are impaired 
when we identify assets that will be taken out of service through the ordinary course of replacement and modernization or through restructuring activities  we shorten the remaining useful lives and adjust the salvage values  as appropriate  to recognize depreciation over the shortened remaining estimated useful lives 
otherwise  we classify assets as held for sale  write down the carrying value to fair value less cost to sell and suspend depreciation on the assets when we formulate a plan of disposal and there is no operational requirement to continue their use 
we determine fair value  in most cases  by reference to third party appraisals  and  in other cases  we perform internal analyses based upon recent sales prices of comparable assets when available 
we periodically evaluate the carrying values of assets held for sale to determine whether revisions are needed to reflect changed circumstances  including market conditions 
in  we realized approximately million of net gains on the disposal of three properties 
in  we recorded million of impairment charges on certain assets  which is net of million of realized gains on the disposal of five properties 
at january   we have three idled properties along with equipment remaining to be sold  which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at approximately million  representing our best estimate of ultimate selling prices less disposal costs 
although we do not anticipate further significant charges  the actual proceeds from the sales of these facilities and the actual costs to dispose of these assets may differ from our current estimates  which would require us to recognize a charge or credit to future earnings 
impairment and amortization of intangible assets 
under fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  amortization of goodwill is eliminated  however  an annual two step impairment test is required 
the first step determines if goodwill is impaired by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole to the book value 
if a deficiency exists  the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss as the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value 
in performing these annual impairment tests  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the carrying values are impaired  and then  if impaired  to determine the amount of any impairment loss required to reduce the carrying value to fair value 
if these estimates or assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
purchased intangibles with indefinite economic lives are tested for impairment annually using a lower of cost or fair value approach 
in determining whether an intangible has an indefinite life  we consider the expected use of the asset  the expected useful lives of other assets to which the asset may relate  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset  and the effects of obsolescence  demand and other economic factors 
in performing these annual impairment tests  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the carrying values are impaired  and then  if impaired  to determine the amount of any impairment loss required to reduce the 
table of contents carrying value to fair value 
if these estimates or assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
other intangibles continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years  and reviewed for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate property  plant and equipment 
pension benefits 
we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires us to recognize pension costs and liabilities based on actuarial evaluations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including the discount rate at which the pension obligations could be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future salary increases  and the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we consider current yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the salary increase assumption is based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the historical rate of return on the invested funds of the pension plan and projected future market returns 
periodic changes in these key assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of recorded pension liabilities and on future pension benefit costs  although sfas no 
permits the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension assumptions on our computation of pension expense to be amortized over future periods 
for instance  given the continued decrease in interest rates  we plan to reduce the discount rate from in to in this assumption change  along with changes in the plan participants demographics and other factors  is expected to increase pension expense by approximately million from fiscal to fiscal although our actual return on pension plan assets was positive in  our after tax minimum pension liability in stockholders equity increased million to million at january  stock compensation 
awards under our incentive compensation plans as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements may include incentive stock awards  nonqualified stock options  reload stock options and restricted shares 
on january   we adopted the prospective transition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure of stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
sfas no 
uses a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock awards using assumptions such as a risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life of the stock award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
by electing the prospective transition method of sfas no 
 our results of operations and our financial position are not affected by stock compensation awards granted prior to january  we recognized approximately million million after tax and million million after tax in stock compensation in and  respectively 
for stock compensation awards granted prior to january   we used the intrinsic value approach under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a comparison of reported results versus proforma results that assumes the fair value based method of sfas no 
had been applied to all stock compensation awards granted

our actual return on plan assets has significantly improved from a loss in to a positive return of in and in  however  we still have an after tax minimum pension liability of approximately million at january  in fiscal and  we contributed million and million  respectively  to our qualified pension plans 
although we are required to make a contribution of only million to our qualified pension plans in  we are currently projecting aggregate contributions of million to million over the next five years  out of which we expect to contribute approximately million in adequacy of borrowing capacity 
availability under our revolver is subject to a borrowing base limitation that is determined based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
as of january   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the revolver and approximately million of availability remaining 
excluding frontier yarns  we also had million in cash available to fund ongoing operations 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that cash flow available from operations  along with the availability under our revolver and cash on hand  will be sufficient to operate our business  satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and pension funding requirements  and meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements  including debt service on our senior notes and the facilities until the maturity of our facilities in contingencies

commitments 
the following table summarizes information about our contractual cash obligations  including those of frontier yarns  as of january  in millions unconditional short term long term capital lease operating purchase fiscal years debt debt obligations leases obligations total thereafter includes guaranteed minimums for utilities and for royalties associated with various sports and league licenses 
obligations under advertising contractual arrangements  cotton purchase obligations and capital expenditure commitments are also included 
other commercial commitments at january  include outstanding letters of credit of approximately million for the purchase of inventories  million for the guarantee of debt of a non affiliated foreign contractor  million related to workers compensation self insured programs and customs bonds  and million related to utility bonds and other matters 
all outstanding letters of credit are set to expire in outlook russell expects sales for fiscal to increase approximately to  to approximately billion to billion 
we expect earnings per share  on a fully diluted basis  to be in the to range for the expected increase in sales in assumes the full year of sales of our three strategic acquisitions aai  huffy sports and brooks made in along with growth in activewear and continued solid performance from our base athletic business despite the loss of the major league baseball licensed apparel business  which represented approximately of the company s net sales

to 
per diluted share and huffy sports will break even or be slightly accretive 
in addition  we expect activewear to have strong earnings growth primarily due to sales growth and lower costs in our new honduras textile operation is expected to be slightly dilutive in the first half of the year but start generating a return in the second half of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our financial risk management objectives are to minimize the potential impact of interest rate  foreign exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage these risks  we may use various financial instruments  including interest rate swap agreements  commodity futures contracts and forward currency exchange contracts 
we only use traded instruments with major financial institutions as the counterparties to minimize the risk of credit loss 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of our accounting policies and the extent of our use of such instruments 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our significant financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates  exchange rates and commodity prices as if these changes had occurred at january  the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions or quoted market prices where available 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates or commodity prices 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
at january   our outstanding debt totaled million  which consisted of fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
based on our average outstanding borrowings under our variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would negatively impact our annual pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair market value of our fixed rate debt at january   by approximately million 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt will not have any impact on us unless we repurchase the debt in the open market 
currency exchange rate sensitivity 
we have foreign currency exposures related to buying  selling and financing in currencies other than our functional currencies 
we also have foreign currency exposure related to foreign denominated revenues and costs translated into us dollars 
these exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro and british pound sterling and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar and japanese yen 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with doing business in foreign currencies 
our policy is to hedge currency exposures of firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in non functional currencies to protect against the possibility of diminished cash flow and adverse impacts on earnings 
a five percentage point adverse change in the foreign currency spot rates would decrease the fair market value of our foreign currency forward contracts held at january   by million 
changes in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts will not have any impact on our results of operations unless these contracts are deemed to be ineffective at hedging currency exposures of anticipated transactions 
we generally view our net investments in foreign subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than the us dollar as long term 
as a result  we generally do not hedge these net investments 
commodity price sensitivity 
the availability and price of cotton is subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions  governmental regulations  economic climate or other unforeseen circumstances 
we are purchasing yarn from frontier yarns  frontier spinning and other third parties  and our yarn pricing will continue to be directly impacted by the price of cotton 
we did not have any outstanding cotton futures contracts at january
