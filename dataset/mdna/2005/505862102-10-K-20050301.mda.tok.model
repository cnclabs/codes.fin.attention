item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of results and outlook this was a record year for us in sales and earnings 
our operating results benefited from stronger economic fundamentals as well as good operating performance 
sustained construction activity in both the us and canada  helped by robust economic growth and continued low interest rates  led to strong demand levels in most of our markets 
in addition  favorable weather both at the beginning and end of the year resulted in strong volumes in the first and fourth quarters  typically low seasons in the construction business 
pricing trends continued to be positive  and successful price increases in most of our product lines were achieved in the majority of our markets 
overall  our income before redeemable preferred shares dividends  interest and income taxes from continuing operations reached a record million  a percent increase over  with strong volumes for cement  aggregates and gypsum 
the prior year included a divestment gain of million related to the sale of our detroit cement terminal 
the canadian dollar favorably contributed million to our operating results  although this was partially offset by a million increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and million of foreign exchange losses on our us dollar investments in canada 
cement operating income was at an all time high  boosted by strong volumes in all markets and improved prices 
our gypsum business returned to full year profitability benefiting from the successful implementation of four price increases throughout the year and supported by improved manufacturing performance 
aggregates  concrete and asphalt operating income improved by percent compared to  driven primarily by the aggregates business which alone generated a million profit improvement 
net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share  including several unusual items that contributed a net benefit of per diluted share 
these unusual items included a tax benefit of million per diluted share  interest income of million million after taxes or per diluted share associated with an income tax receivable partially offset by legal expenses of million million after taxes or per diluted share related to settled litigation in our cement segment 
the results of the year compare with an income of million  or per diluted share in which included a gain of million million after taxes or per diluted share from the sale of one of our cement terminals  partially offset by million per diluted share associated with provincial tax changes legislated in both ontario and alberta as well as the higher tax rate applicable to the sale of the detroit cement terminal 
we closed the year in strong financial condition 
at the end of the year  total debt net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was negative million compared with positive million in our total debt was million as of december  compared with million at the end of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at the end of the year compared to million at the end of reported cash flow from operations was million compared with the million in  reflecting our decision to make additional cash contributions in to pre fund certain pension plans reducing the comparative cash flows by approximately million and decreasing the amount of securitized receivable financing reducing the comparative cash flows by approximately million 
on october   president george w 
bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
among other things  the new legislation reduces the tax rate on foreign earnings repatriated to the us by december  and subsequently used for qualifying reinvestments in the us in  we decided to take advantage of this temporary deduction and intend to repatriate almost billion in cash from canada to the us this money represents accumulated after tax earnings associated with our normal operations in canada 
we will record a one time tax charge associated with the repatriation of between million and million during the first quarter of the exact amount of these taxes depends on pending technical corrections to the legislation and expected interpretative guidelines to be issued by the internal revenue service 
the repatriation will allow us to improve our capital structure and more efficiently deploy available capital 
looking forward to  we have seen no indications of change in the overall market environment since the strong close to the fourth quarter of however  year over year comparisons will also have to take into account the high level of demand growth and favorable weather conditions experienced in we expect the continuation of solid demand and a favorable pricing environment in most of our markets 
however  we also expect to experience cost pressures  especially in energy and energy related costs such as distribution costs 
also  we estimate our pension and other postretirement expenses to increase by million in on july   we will commence recognizing expenses associated with then unvested stock option grants and new stock option grants after that date in connection with our adoption of a new accounting standard 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
management s discussion of income the consolidated statements of income included in item of this annual report summarize the operating performance of lafarge north america inc for the past three years 
it should be noted that the discussions focus on earnings from continuing operations 
lafarge florida inc our cement import and grinding operation was sold to florida rock industries inc in august the florida operations  including the gain on the sale  are shown separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations in both and to facilitate analysis  net sales and operating profit are discussed by operating segment and are summarized in the table below 
see note segment and related information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further segment information 
our three operating segments are aggregates  concrete asphalt the production and distribution of construction aggregates  ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and asphalt  and the construction and paving of roads 
cement the production and distribution of portland and specialty cements and slag  fly ash and associated blended products  and the processing of fuel quality waste and alternative raw materials for use in cement kilns 
gypsum the production and distribution of gypsum drywall and related products 
years ended december in millions net sales from continuing operations aggregates  concrete asphalt cement gypsum eliminations total gross profit from continuing operations aggregates  concrete asphalt cement gypsum total operational overhead and other expenses aggregates  concrete asphalt cement gypsum total income loss from continuing operations aggregates  concrete asphalt cement gypsum total corporate and unallocated expenses earnings from continuing operations before minority interests  interest and income taxes a assets aggregates  concrete asphalt cement gypsum corporate and unallocated assets discontinued operations total a ebit is reconciled to the closest gaap measure in item selected consolidated financial data 
year ended december  net sales our net sales from continuing operations increased percent in to  million from  million in demand for our products remained robust  which was supported by stronger economic conditions and continued low interest rates 
in addition  we benefited from favorable weather both at the start and end of the year 
excluding divested operations  all our product lines recorded higher shipments for the full year compared to last year  with cement  aggregates and gypsum setting new records for volumes 
compared to  our selling prices generally increased with the exception of our paving business 
in addition  net sales benefited from continued strength of the canadian dollar  which finished the year close to cents per us dollar compared to cents per us dollar in the prior year 
excluding the exchange rate effect  net sales from continuing operations were percent higher than last year 
us net sales from continuing operations increased to  million  up percent compared to  million in  driven by high cement  aggregate and gypsum sales 
canadian net sales increased percent to  million in percent excluding the favorable exchange rate effect primarily due to higher cement  aggregate and paving sales 
aggregates  concrete asphalt net sales from the aggregates  concrete and asphalt segment  formerly identified as construction materials segment  totaled  million in  which were percent higher than the  million in excluding the impact of the favorable canadian exchange rate  net sales were up percent with stronger sales across all product lines 
net sales of construction aggregates were million  which were percent higher than percent higher excluding the favorable exchange rate 
shipments of construction aggregates increased percent in to a record million tons as a result of good weather conditions and solid overall demand in the us and in canada 
us volumes were up percent as a result of higher sales in the great lakes  maryland and missouri 
canadian volumes were percent higher than levels due to strong sales in western canada  certain ontario markets and montreal as well as increased exports to the us west coast 
average selling prices in were up percent in canada  in local currency  and percent in the us due in part to a better product mix as well as successful implementation of general price increases in most markets 
ready mixed concrete sales totaled million in  up percent from last year percent higher  excluding the favorable exchange rate 
overall ready mixed concrete shipments increased by percent to million cubic yards as stronger demand in western canada offset a flat us market 
strong sales in maryland  new york and new mexico were offset by lower volumes in louisiana completion of new orleans airport project and missouri 
canadian volumes increased by percent over  as residential construction activity in vancouver and calgary remained strong 
however  price improvement gains in most regions were offset by pricing pressures in the denver  toronto and montreal markets 
asphalt and paving sales totaled million in  up percent from up percent  excluding the favorable exchange rate 
asphalt volumes were up percent compared to prior year due to strong demand  particularly in calgary and denver  and more favorable weather 
excluding divested operations  paving volumes were up percent due to strong demand in calgary  edmonton and denver 
cement cement net sales from continuing operations increased percent to  million in from  million in up percent excluding the favorable exchange rate 
cement shipments in reached a record million tons  which were percent higher than shipments excluding divested florida operations 
strong general economic conditions and favorable weather contributed to make an exceptionally strong volume year 
some regional cement shortages were experienced  particularly in the first half of the year  requiring imports in order to meet customer demand 
sales volumes in the us  excluding divested florida operations  increased by percent compared to  driven by strong demand in all major markets except the great lakes markets  which were flat 
in canada  sales volumes increased percent as demand was up sharply in western canada 
average selling prices continued their positive trend that began in the second quarter  driven by successful price increases in a majority of our markets between january and may 
for the first time in more than a decade  we were able to successfully implement a second price increase in selected us markets allowing us to recover most of the shortfall due to the price degradation that occurred in the second half of average selling prices increased by percent year over year  with the us gaining percent and canada increasing by percent in local currency 
we expect the full benefit of these price increases will be realized during in addition  new price increases of to per ton took effect in most of our us and canadian markets on january   and an additional price increase of per ton in most markets has been announced in the us effective july  gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in benefiting from strong demand as well as the impact of four price increases implemented throughout the year 
sales volume reached billion square feet  which represents an increase of percent over sales volume 
we experienced continued growth of residential construction both in the us and canada  supported by significantly improved manufacturing performance by our plants 
the average mill net price per thousand square feet for the year was compared with in  mainly derived from the strong performance of our us markets 
a price increase went into effect on january  performance by line of business aggregates  concrete asphalt our aggregates  concrete and asphalt segment earned million on sales of billion  percent higher than earnings of million on sales of billion 
profit growth was driven primarily by the aggregates business  which alone generated a million profit improvement 
the favorable impact of the canadian dollar  which contributed million to reported profit for the year  was more than offset by a million increase in pension and other postretirement expenses 
in addition  higher fuel costs across all product lines and increased maintenance costs with higher plant activity resulted in increased operating costs 
as a result  segment operating income as a percentage of net sales at percent was flat compared to construction aggregates recorded an operating income of million in  which was percent higher than  driven by record volumes and higher selling prices across all regions 
this was partially offset by cost increases  including additional quarry stripping costs of million and higher energy costs of million 
operating margin improved by percentage point in compared to the year ago level 
ready mixed concrete profits declined by million to million in most of the shortfall came from the denver  toronto and montreal markets where market conditions and competitive pressures limited our ability to recoup increased raw material prices 
the strong performance of our western canada and eastern us markets partially offset the shortfall 
performance based distribution initiatives continued to help offset increased delivery  maintenance and fuel costs 
operating margin was percentage point lower than last year 
asphalt and paving operations earned million in  which was flat compared to paving contract margins declined  which more than offset benefits from increased asphalt volumes and the absence of losses associated with the western us portable highway paving business we exited in increased use of recycled products helped offset higher costs during the year 
cement cement operating profit from continuing operations was million in  which was percent higher than last year 
the results reflect increased volumes  higher prices and the stronger canadian dollar  which were partially offset by increased fuel  raw material and distribution costs 
strong general economic conditions and sustained construction activity allowed us to successfully implement two price increases in selected us markets 
a million favorable impact of the canadian dollar partially offset a million increase in pension and other postretirement expenses and million of legal expenses related to settled litigation 
clinker production at million tons was up  tons for the year 
this percent production increase was achieved without increasing plant fixed costs from levels 
several of our plants achieved record production levels for the year 
variable costs were up for the year  primarily driven by fuel and power costs increases which unfavorably impacted operating earnings by million 
freight costs increased million due to sub optimal shipping patterns we experienced to serve our customers during the tight market conditions earlier this year 
as a result  cement operating income from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales was percent  which was similar to in  we increased our imports by approximately  short tons to meet our customer needs 
the low margin sales of imported cement combined with the legal fees associated with the settled litigation negatively impacted our operating margin 
gypsum our gypsum drywall operations recorded million operating profit in compared to a loss of million in  an improvement of million 
our gypsum operations have generated profit for the past quarters  as we benefited from continued strong residential demand and higher prices 
in addition  significantly improved manufacturing productivity improved our overall performance  partially offsetting higher paper costs and increased energy expenses 
production volumes from our two newer plants in kentucky and florida now account for percent of total production 
corporate and unallocated expenses corporate and unallocated expenses in were million  which represents an increase of million compared to the prior year included a million gain on the sale of our detroit cement terminal 
higher corporate expenses in  due to increased pension and other postretirement expenses  higher salaries  governance and compliance costs  were partially offset by million of lower foreign exchange transaction losses 
income from managed assets income from the managed assets amounted to million in  which represents an increase of million compared to as a result of a management incentive fee we received from lafarge sa for exceeding agreed upon performance targets 
gross proceeds from the management of these assets totaled million in  as compared to million in total proceeds included billings for the annual management fee million in and million in  as well as direct payroll  pension and postretirement costs and allocated selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses associated with management of these assets were million and million in and  respectively 
we are fully reimbursed for these expenses under the terms of the management agreement 
interest expense interest expense for the year was million  million lower than last year 
the fixed to floating rate interest rate swap we executed in the first quarter of reduced interest expenses by million 
in addition  interest expense on our short term debt borrowings decreased by million versus due to lower average borrowing levels 
interest income interest income for the year was million  which represents an increase of million compared to the increase is due to the recognition of lower currency translation losses on us dollar investments in canada  which favorably impacted the year over year comparison by million 
in addition  we recognized million of interest income associated with an income tax receivable and interest income increased by million as a result of higher average investment balances 
income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations increased to million in from million in our tax expense was impacted in both and by certain unusual items 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of million 
in  we recognized an additional million of tax expenses to reflect provincial tax changes legislated in both ontario and alberta  as well as the higher tax rate applicable to the sale of the detroit cement terminal in the third quarter 
excluding these tax adjustments  the effective tax rate for and was approximately percent and percent  respectively 
net income net income was million or per diluted share  compared with net income in of million  or per diluted share 
current year results included several unusual items that contributed a net benefit of per diluted share 
these unusual items included a tax benefit of million per diluted share  interest income of million million after taxes or per diluted share associated with an income tax receivable partially offset by legal expenses of million million after taxes or per diluted share related to settled litigation in our cement segment 
prior year results included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share  a charge of million per diluted share representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a gain of million million after taxes or per diluted share from the sale of one of our cement terminals and a charge of million per diluted share associated with provincial tax changes legislated in both ontario and alberta as well as the higher tax rate applicable to the sale of the detroit cement terminal 
year ended december  net sales lafarge s net sales from continuing operations increased percent in to  million from  million in demand for our products remained solid and we benefited during the third and fourth quarters from the pent up demand that built up during the first half of the year  when market conditions were particularly difficult due to poor weather 
cement  aggregate and gypsum wallboard shipments for the full year were above last year  while shipments of ready mixed concrete were flat  and asphalt and paving sales fell short of last year 
when compared to  our selling prices generally increased  with the exception of the us cement market and our paving business 
in addition  net sales benefited from continued strength of the canadian dollar  which finished the year close to cents per us dollar 
excluding the exchange rate effect  net sales from continuing operations were equal to last year 
excluding the favorable exchange rate effect  the increase in cement and gypsum net sales was partially offset by the drop in sales of our aggregates  concrete and asphalt segment 
by region  us net sales from continuing operations decreased to  million in compared to  million in  driven by lower cement and asphalt and paving sales 
canadian net sales increased percent to  million in percent excluding the favorable exchange rate effect  primarily due to higher cement  aggregate and ready mixed concrete sales 
aggregates  concrete asphalt net sales from the aggregates  concrete and asphalt segment totaled  million in  percent higher than the  million in excluding the impact of favorable canadian exchange rate  net sales were down percent 
stronger sales in construction aggregates were offset by a decline in asphalt and paving sales 
net sales of construction aggregates were million  percent higher than percent higher excluding the favorable exchange rate 
shipments of construction aggregates increased percent in to million tons  with us volumes up percent as a result of higher sales in missouri and new mexico as well as higher resales in the great lakes 
canadian volumes were percent lower than levels due to lower shipments in most of our western canadian markets as well as lower exports to the us west coast 
average selling prices in were up percent in canada  in local currency  and percent in the us due in part to a better product mix as well as successful implementation of general price increases in most markets 
ready mixed concrete sales totaled million in  up percent from last year flat to  excluding the favorable exchange rate 
overall ready mixed concrete shipments fell slightly to million cubic yards with stronger demand in canada offsetting a percent volume decline in western us markets 
the deterioration in the construction economy in colorado and new mexico resulted in both lower volume and prices 
canadian volumes increased by percent over  with sustained project work in the energy mining sector montreal and vancouver 
in addition  average canadian prices in local currency increased by percent compared to to strong project pricing and higher value added sales 
asphalt and paving sales totaled million in  down percent from down percent  excluding the favorable exchange rate 
asphalt and paving volumes were down percent and percent  respectively  in compared to prior year 
lower volumes in the us were due primarily to weather in the first half of the year  weak construction activity in our principal western us markets as well as our exit from our western us portable highway paving business in the second quarter of further contributing to lower sales was lower demand in eastern canada due to a weather related slow start of the paving season and less asphalt paving content in projects 
cement cement net sales from continuing operations increased percent to  million in from  million in up percent excluding the favorable exchange rate 
with strong shipments in the fourth quarter  full year sales volumes from our continuing operations in reached million tons  up percent from sales volumes in the us increased a modest percent compared to while in canada  sales volumes increased percent as demand was up sharply in the western provinces 
average selling prices in canada were up percent in local currency  reflecting the impact of general price increases implemented early in the year 
prices in the us declined percent as the planned april price increase met with limited success and some price degradation occurred due to competitive activity in several markets 
gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in  benefiting from strong demand as well as the impact of the price increases implemented in the second half of the year 
sales volume reached billion square feet  an increase of percent from  which is in line with the increase in demand reported by the gypsum association for the markets served by our plants 
the average mill net price per thousand square feet for the year was compared with in prices increased significantly during the fourth quarter and a further price increase was implemented in january performance by line of business aggregates  concrete asphalt our aggregates  concrete and asphalt segment earned million on sales of billion  down percent from earnings of million on sales of billion 
the favorable impact of the canadian dollar  which contributed million to reported profit for the year  was more than offset by an million dollar increase in pension and other postretirement costs 
in addition  losses incurred in our western us portable highway paving business that we exited in the second quarter of and lower levels of paving activities in colorado reduced profits for the year 
as a result  operating income as a percentage of net sales was percent in compared to percent in construction aggregates recorded an operating income of million in  in line with last year  as higher volumes and prices were offset by pension expenses  which increased by million  and higher operating costs resulting in part from weather related inefficiencies 
ready mixed concrete profits declined million to million in most of the shortfall was in the western us as continued weak market conditions resulted in a percent drop in volumes and competitive price pressures 
in canada  ready mixed concrete profits were equal to last year as a decline in eastern canada  due largely to difficult market conditions in toronto  was offset by improved profitability in our western canadian operations  due to higher volumes in vancouver and generally higher margins 
our ready mixed concrete operations were negatively impacted by an annual increase of million in pension expense in asphalt and paving operations earned million in  about million less than in prior year 
profits in eastern canada increased by percent over as lower costs and improved margins offset lower volumes 
weak market conditions in the western us  combined with losses associated with the portable highway paving operations that we exited during the year  resulted in a significant drop in earnings in that market  more than offsetting the improvement in eastern canada 
in addition  pension expense for this product line increased million in cement cement operating profit from continuing operations was million  in line with last year 
the favorable impact of the canadian dollar was million  which offset a million increase in pension and other postretirement costs 
higher volumes and higher prices in canada were partially offset by weaker us prices 
in addition  margins declined as most of the increased tonnage sold in the second half of the year came out of inventory rather than incremental production 
in terms of operating costs  fixed costs were lower by million due to lower maintenance expenses as well as the absence of costs related to the start up of our plant near kansas city and the bath strike in variable costs per ton was down slightly for the year as significant improvement in fuel cost at our exshaw plant  due to the conversion to coal from natural gas  was largely offset by a reduction in the availability and pricing of fuel quality waste used in some of our plants 
finally  the profitability of our cement related products business declined in  primarily due to lower slag results and clinker sales volumes 
as a result  cement operating income from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales was percent in  which was down from percent in the prior year 
gypsum our gypsum drywall operations returned to profitability starting the second half of  as we benefited from continued strong residential demand and higher prices  particularly in the fourth quarter 
for the full year  the gypsum operations lost million  which represented an improvement of million from due to a combination of improved manufacturing performance as well as price and volume increases 
production volumes from our two newer plants in kentucky and florida accounted for percent of total production compared to percent last year 
the idling of our wilmington plant in late resulted in the anticipated cost savings of approximately million 
however  higher natural gas prices  increased wage rates  higher labor costs related to increased production levels in our remaining plants  as well as increased pension costs and higher depreciation expense offset the wilmington savings in the operating loss of million excludes a million charge recorded in other income expense  net for the idling of our wilmington  delaware plant 
corporate and unallocated expenses corporate and unallocated expenses in were million  which represented a decrease of million compared to the decrease was due to a million gain on the sale of the detroit cement terminal partially offset by a million increase in foreign exchange transaction losses and the absence of an million credit recognized in related to a natural gas derivative that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
the provision of million recognized in for the idling of our gypsum drywall plant in wilmington was offset by a gain on the sale of our canadian paving stone business in that same year 
income from managed assets income from the managed assets amounted to million in both and gross proceeds from the management of these assets totaled million in  compared to million in total proceeds included billings for the annual management fee million in both years  as well as direct payroll  pension and postretirement costs and allocated selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses associated with management of these assets were million and million in and  respectively 
we are fully reimbursed for these expenses under the terms of the management agreement 
interest expense interest expense for the year was million  up million from due to the absence of million of capitalized interest in and a million interest expense increase from a long term bond issued in june these were partially offset by a reduction in short term interest expense due to a combination of lower debt levels and lower interest rates 
interest income interest income was million  a decrease of million from as foreign exchange losses of million on us dollar investments in canada  due to the devaluation of the us dollar  offset an increase in interest from investments 
income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in  including an million tax expense increase in due to provincial tax changes legislated in both ontario and alberta as well as the higher tax rate applicable to the sale of the detroit cement terminal in the third quarter 
the results benefited from the recognition of approximately million in tax benefits related to the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance million and the favorable final settlement of various tax issues with both us and canadian authorities million in the fourth quarter 
excluding these tax adjustments  the effective tax rate for was percent compared with approximately percent in net income net income was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income in of million or per diluted share 
net income in from continuing operations  which excludes the results of the divested florida operations  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in the results include a net gain of million  or per diluted share  related to the increase in the canadian deferred tax provision and a gain from the sale of our detroit  michigan cement terminal 
the results contain a net gain of million  or per diluted share  from favorable tax adjustments and a gain on the sale of our canadian paving stone business  offset by a charge for the idling of our gypsum plant in wilmington  delaware 
net income from discontinued operations for the full year was million  or per diluted share including the divestment gain after tax of million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in management s discussion of cash flows the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our main sources and uses of cash 
these statements show the relationship between the operations presented in the consolidated statements of income and liquidity and financial resources depicted in the consolidated balance sheets 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of capital expenditures  working capital needs  debt service obligations and dividends 
we usually meet our operating liquidity needs through internal generation of cash except in the event of significant acquisitions 
short term borrowings are generally used to fund seasonal operating requirements  particularly in the first two calendar quarters 
cash flows from operations the net cash provided by operations for each of the three years presented reflects our net income adjusted for the net effects of operating transactions and other events that affect net income and operating cash flows in different periods 
significant adjustments are discussed below  except for changes in working capital  which are discussed in management s discussion of financial position 
the non cash adjustment for depreciation  depletion and amortization in increased by million reflecting new assets placed in service resulting from an increase in capital expenditures million and the commencement of amortization of certain information technology projects 
the non cash adjustment for depreciation  depletion and amortization in increased by million due to annualization effect of assets put in service in the course of mainly the sugar creek cement plant and the chicago slag operation  offset by the change in useful lives of our cement plants in july month impact of million decrease 
the non cash adjustment for gain on sale of assets for and was relatively similar million in and million in  as both years were impacted by large divestment gains detroit cement terminal in and paving stone divestiture in eastern canada in 
the impact of the gain on the sale of discontinued operations lafarge florida inc  including related income taxes paid  is shown separately 
as a result of improving liquidity  we significantly reduced the amount of securitized receivable financing 
the impact of this change reduced the comparative cash flows from operations by approximately million 
the adjustment for net change in noncurrent assets and liabilities primarily reflects the change in pension contributions  which increased by million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows from investing in  net cash used for investing activities increased million to million 
capital expenditures more than doubled during as compared with  from million to million  due to million of additional capital expenditures associated with our sugar creek  missouri cement plant see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for more information  increased spending on information technology projects  costs associated with the replacement terminal in detroit  michigan  and timing factors associated with various projects 
redemption of short term investments  net  for was million compared to purchases of short term investments  net in of million  both years reflecting the change in the amount of excess cash in canada that was invested in short term investments with original maturities exceeding three months 
proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items totaled million in compared to million in proceeds for includes several individually insignificant sale transactions while proceeds from include million from the sale of the detroit cement terminal 
in  net cash used for investing decreased million compared to capital expenditures decreased million in largely because ongoing development projects  such as the construction of the sugar creek  missouri plant and chicago slag project  were completed in spending on acquisitions decreased million to million as only a few small acquisitions were made 
purchases of short term investments  net  for was million compared to redemptions of short term investments  net for of million  both years reflecting the change in the amount of excess cash in canada that was invested in short term investments with original maturities exceeding three months 
proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items totaled million in compared to million in  as both years had significant proceeds related to the detroit cement terminal in and paving stone divestiture in eastern canada in in addition to the routine sales of surplus land and retail mobile equipment 
the proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of million lafarge florida inc  and related income taxes paid  are shown separately 
cash flows from financing in  net cash provided by financing was million compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in the change reflects an increase in short term borrowings in whereas we repaid short term borrowings in repayments were made in utilizing cash proceeds received in connection with the two large asset dispositions noted above 
issuance of long term debt for includes million of proceeds received in connection with the issuance of industrial revenue bonds related to our sugar creek  missouri plant 
also  proceeds from issuance of equity securities increased to million in from million in due to more employee stock option exercises in in  net cash consumed by financing was million compared to million in this increase of million resulted from the net repayment of short term borrowings of million in versus net repayment of only million in  an increase in dividends of million and a decrease in the issuance of equity securities of million  offset by an increase in long term debt mainly due to the issuance of the industrial revenue bonds discussed above 
we have access to a wide variety of short term and long term financing alternatives in both the us and canada 
these include a commercial paper facility under which we may from time to time issue up to an aggregate principal amount of million in unsecured  short term promissory notes through private placements 
the facility is percent backed by a syndicated  multi year committed bank revolver  which expires in april commercial paper borrowings as of december  and were million and zero  respectively 
we also have a syndicated million multi year committed bank revolver maturing in april at december  and  no amounts were outstanding under the committed bank revolver 
we also have a receivables securitization program to provide a cost effective source of working capital and short term financing 
under the program  we agreed to transfer  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable to unrelated third party purchasers up to a maximum of million 
under the agreements  new receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold receivables 
we service  administer and collect the receivables sold  which as of december  and  were zero and million  respectively 
since this program is accounted for as a sale of receivables  the related cash flows are included in net cash provided by operations 
in  the strengthening of the canadian dollar resulted in a positive effect of million on the cash flow statement  directly related to the impact of exchange rate changes on the cash in canada 
management s discussion of financial position the consolidated balance sheets summarize our financial position at december  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our canadian revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars  as well as interest rate risk inherent in our debt 
the value reported for canadian dollar denominated net assets increased from december  as a result of a rise in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
at december   the us dollar equivalent of a canadian dollar was versus at december  based on results  if the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar changed by percent  our consolidated net assets and net income each would change by approximately percent 
working capital  excluding cash  short term investments  short term borrowings  redeemable preferred stock  current portion of long term debt and the impact of exchange rate changes million increase  increased million from december  to december  receivables  net including due from affiliates  excluding an exchange rate increase of million  increased million primarily due to a decrease in receivables sold under our securitization program and increased sales 
inventories decreased million  excluding the exchange rate increase of million  due to increased levels of sales in the fourth quarter of compared to accounts payable and accrued liabilities  excluding the exchange rate increase of million  decreased million mainly due to a decrease in amounts payable under our receivable sales agreement 
income taxes payable increased million due to stronger earnings in the fourth quarter  which resulted in higher income taxes payable 
net property  plant and equipment increased million during  excluding the exchange rate increase of million  as capital expenditures outpaced depreciation 
no significant acquisitions were made in goodwill relates primarily to the redland  warren and presque isle transactions 
our operating cash flows are generally sufficient to provide all of the cash operating requirements  including capital expenditures  on an annual basis  although short term debt to fund seasonal working capital needs and operating losses is incurred during the first six months of the year 
we maintain sufficient liquidity resources  including a million commercial paper line  a million accounts receivable securitization line  a committed million multi year revolver  a bi lateral committed facility of million  and over million in uncommitted bi lateral bank facilities  to ensure that our cash requirements are met under any circumstances 
a million bond  issued in to fund an acquisition  will mature in july at maturity  we intend to use internal cash  short term debt capacity  or a combination thereof  to repay the bond 
as noted above  we decided that we will repatriate almost billion of canadian earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
repatriation will substantially increase liquidity in the united states  although use of the additional liquidity would be restricted by the domestic reinvestment plan required by the jobs act 
there will be a corresponding reduction in liquidity at our lafarge canada inc lci subsidiary 
lci may be required to borrow in order to repatriate their earnings to the us in addition  beginning on december   canadian million approximately us million in preferred shares issued by a canadian subsidiary in  in connection with our acquisition of the warren paving and materials group  will be redeemable at the option of the holder 
we also may be required to borrow if the holder of the preferred shares elects to redeem these shares 
we expect our significant positive canadian cash flows would be sufficient to repay any debt and replenish canadian cash balances over time 
contractual obligations our summary of contractual obligations and maturities as of december  is as follows in thousands less than total one year years years years long term debt a redeemable preferred stock operating leases purchase obligations capital noncapital total a excludes interest 
the amounts set forth in the table above for noncapital purchase obligations relate primarily to contractual purchase obligations related to gas  power  fuel and other significant raw material commitments as well as mineral royalties 
in addition  we are required to make contributions to certain defined benefit plans 
our estimated contributions total million 
due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future contributions  such as interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns  we are unable to reasonably estimate our future contributions beyond we also have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings 
these contracts are discrete in nature  and it is unlikely that the various contingencies within the contract would be triggered by a common event 
the future payments under these contracts are not included in the table set forth above 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
management s discussion of shareholders equity the consolidated statements of shareholders equity summarize the activity in each component of shareholders equity for the three years presented 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million  a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a percent increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  the reduction to accumulated other comprehensive loss for million related to the minimum pension liability and the exercise of stock options resulting in an increase of million 
these were partially offset by share repurchases of million and dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million  a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a percent increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  and the exercise of stock options resulting in an increase of million 
these were partially offset by dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million  and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss for million related to the minimum pension liability 
common equity interests include our par value per share common stock and the lafarge canada inc exchangeable preference shares exchangeable shares  which are exchangeable into our common stock and have comparable voting  dividend and liquidation rights 
our common stock is traded on the new york and toronto stock exchanges under the ticker symbol laf and the exchangeable shares on the toronto stock exchange under the ticker symbol lcipre the following table reflects the range of high and low closing prices of common stock by quarter for and as quoted on the new york stock exchange quarters ended mar jun sep dec stock prices high low stock prices high low dividends are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december common equity dividends less dividend reinvestments net cash dividend payments common equity dividends per share as of the third quarter of  the dividend rate was changed from cents to cents per share per quarter 
other factors affecting the company critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
goodwill on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
in our goodwill impairment test  we use a combination of a market approach and an income approach when determining the fair value of our reporting units 
in the market approach  we compare our reporting units with similar businesses  business ownership interests or manufacturing facilities that have been sold 
in the income approach  we estimate the discounted value of the expected future cash flows that we expect our reporting units to generate based on our budgets and projections 
similar to our review for impairment of long lived assets  evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  the evolution of expenses  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits the accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefits requires us to make certain assumptions that have a significant impact on the expenses and liabilities that we record for pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
the primary assumptions made to account for pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities are disclosed in note pension plan and other postretirement benefits of the consolidated financial statements 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of investment return on pension plan assets is based on historical performance  current and long term outlook and the asset mix in the pension trust funds 
the discount rates reflect the rate of long term high grade corporate bonds 
the pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses are impacted by the year end assumptions for the discount rate and the return rate on assets pension plan only 
if the discount rate assumption had been lowered by one percentage point  pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses would have increased by approximately million 
if the asset returns rate assumption had been lowered by one percentage point  pension plan expenses would have increased by approximately million 
the pension and other postretirement accumulated benefit obligations are impacted by the discount rate 
the impact of decreasing the discount rate assumption by one percentage point as of november  would have been to increase the total accumulated benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million  and would have increased the additional minimum pension liability amount by approximately million 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reflected at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we did not identify any impairment during and in november  an impairment charge was recognized in relation to the idling of the gypsum drywall plant in wilmington  delaware 
this resulted in a million asset write off 
environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability for environmental matters has been incurred  an undiscounted estimate of the required remediation costs is recorded as a liability in the consolidated financial statements  without offset of potential insurance recoveries 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of cement  cement related products  aggregates  ready mixed concrete  concrete products  asphalt and gypsum drywall is recorded when title and ownership are transferred upon delivery of the products 
revenue from waste recovery and disposal is recognized when the material is received  tested and accepted 
revenue from road construction contracts is recognized on the basis of units of work completed  while revenue from other indivisible lump sum contracts is recognized using the cost to cost method to determine the percentage of completion 
amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling are included in net sales  and costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as cost of goods sold 
inflation inflation rates in recent years have not been a significant factor in our net sales or earnings growth 
we continually attempt to offset the effect of inflation by purchasing strategies and improving operating efficiencies  especially in the areas of productivity  energy costs  and selling and administrative expenses 
we compete with other suppliers of our products in all of our markets 
the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher prices for our products varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market 
environmental matters our operations  like those of our competitors  are subject to federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations that impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste  require pollution control and prevention measures to be undertaken and require certain permits and approvals for us to conduct many of our operations 
as a consequence  we maintain an environmental program designed to monitor and control environmental matters relevant to us  including changes in applicable laws and regulations as well as instances where corrective action may be needed 
we recruit  employ and train personnel experienced in environmental matters who are responsible for identifying developments relating to environmental matters and bringing them to management s attention  including emergency reporting and quarterly reporting of environmental matters 
we routinely audit our properties to determine whether environmental remediation may be required  the amount of any necessary related provisions  the status of remedial activities undertaken and whether improvements may be required to meet current and future environmental requirements 
we may capitalize environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or that are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination 
we expense other environmental costs when incurred 
our environmental capital expenditures and expenses were not material for the years ended december   and and we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of our known environmental contingencies  for which we have recorded provisions for estimated probable liabilities  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  our environmental expenditures have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future 
changes to existing or new environmental laws or regulations  or interpretations thereof  may impose substantial further environmental obligations on us 
such changes may include revised epa boiler and industrial furnaces regulations  final residual risk or maximum achievable control technology provisions governing air toxic emissions  cement kiln dust management standards or programs  revised state implementation plans regarding nox reductions  revised state implementation plans regarding reduction of fine particulate matter particles  federal major source permit requirements  and implementation of the kyoto protocol 
we cannot presently determine the effect such changes may have on us  including the nature and amount of any required capital expenditures or other remedial actions  or on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency risks 
we have defined strict policies and procedures to measure  manage and monitor our market risk exposures 
our policies do not permit any speculative market position 
we use financial instruments only to hedge existing or anticipated financial and commercial exposures 
we undertake this hedging in the over the counter market with a limited number of highly rated counter parties 
our positions in derivative financial instruments are monitored using various techniques  including the fair value approach 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes principally in coal  petroleum coke  natural gas  electricity  diesel fuel and liquid asphalt cement 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into long term contracts  increasing our use of alternative fuels  or using commodity based derivatives 
we execute commodity based derivatives only for the purpose of hedging the economic exposure to commodity price changes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices  we are exposed to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counter party to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counter party owes us  which creates credit risk for us 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counter party and  therefore  do not have a credit risk 
we minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with what we believe are low credit risk counter parties 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices 
we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
as such  a percent change in the commodity prices for hedged items would cause a change on our december  consolidated net assets and the consolidated other comprehensive income by less than million  net of any other impact 
such a change would have no impact on net income as our derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of the fair value change reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency risk translation risk the assets  liabilities  income and expenses of our canadian operating entities are denominated in a foreign currency 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars 
thus  assets  liabilities  income and expenses denominated in currencies other than us dollars must be translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate to be included in our financial statements 
if the us dollar increases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in the canadian dollar will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in canadian dollars will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar has a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our canadian dollar denominated assets  liabilities  income and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
at december  and for the year then ended  approximately percent of our consolidated net assets and percent of consolidated net income was attributable to subsidiaries that prepare their financial statements in canadian dollars 
as such  a percent change in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate would cause a change on consolidated net assets and consolidated net income by approximately million and million  net of any other impact  respectively 
transaction risk we are subject to limited foreign currency exchange risks as a consequence of commercial exposures related to purchase and sale transactions in currencies other than our operating currencies 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange risks related to transactions is not material 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our debt 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
in february  we entered into a million interest rate swap which effectively converts our million bond  maturing in july  from a fixed rate coupon of percent to a floating rate coupon at six month libor plus a fixed spread of percent 
at december we had no other derivative instruments related to interest rates 
our interest rate exposure can be subdivided into the following risks price risk for fixed rate financial assets and liabilities by contracting a fixed rate liability  for example  we are exposed to an opportunity cost in the event of a fall in interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the market value of fixed rate assets and liabilities  leaving the associated financial income or expense unchanged 
at december  and after giving effect to the interest rate swap noted above  percent of our consolidated indebtedness was contracted at fixed rates 
cash flow risk for floating rate assets and liabilities changes in interest rates have little impact on the market value of floating rate assets and liabilities  but directly influence our future income or expense flows 
we use variable rate debt to finance our operations 
at december   approximately percent of our consolidated indebtedness was at variable rates  which exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
as such  a one percent change in the average interest rate would have caused a change in consolidated net income by approximately million  net of any other impact
