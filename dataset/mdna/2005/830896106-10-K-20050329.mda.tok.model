item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the purpose of management s discussion and analysis is to focus on certain significant factors which have affected our operating results and financial condition  and to provide shareholders a more comprehensive review of the figures contained in the financial data of this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto  included as pages f through f of this report 
items of significance in march   we issued million of subordinated debentures  which carry an adjustable interest rate of basis points above the three month libor 
these debentures mature march  these debentures are viewed as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
as such  the capital may be leveraged to further enhance our operations through leverage or acquisition 
in  we recorded net income of million or per share on a diluted basis compared to million or per share on a diluted basis in this represents an increase of  or in net income and or per share on a diluted basis between and this increase is due to an increase in net interest income of million arising from our growth 
return on average equity for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  book value of our common stock increased from at december  to at december  total assets increased by million  or from the fiscal year ended december  total gross loans increased by million  or from the fiscal year ended december  capital adequacy ratios continue to meet criteria of well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
financial condition total assets increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in total assets during is the result of planned growth across the balance sheet 
total net loans increased from million at december  to million  an increase of million or  while the investment portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of 
growth in deposits funded the majority of the increase  as successful marketing campaigns and new product launches resulted in an increase in total deposits from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
growth not funded through deposits was funded through the use of long term fhlb advances 
investment portfolio the main objectives of our investment portfolio are to achieve a competitive rate of return over a reasonable time period and to provide liquidity 
our total investment portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of 
the increase is the result of the investment of excess funds into agencies and mortgage backed securities  both deposits and borrowings  which were raised in accordance with our strategic plans 
certain mortgage backed securities totaling million were purchased during as a direct replacement of loans  as loan payoffs exceeded management s expectations 
mortgage backed securities represented a replacement of these loan funds 
the current investment strategy has concentrated on the purchase of us government and agency obligations  and corporate bonds generally maturing or callable within five to seven years 
the investment policy also permits investments in mortgage backed securities  usually having a longer weighted average life 
the investment policy  however  limits the duration of the aggregate investment portfolio to years 
at december   the portfolio duration was years 
we do not purchase investments with off balance sheet characteristics  such as swaps  options  futures  or any other hedging activities that are called derivatives 
the held to maturity portfolio consists of mortgage backed securities that can potentially secure borrowings from the fhlb and securities issued by states of the united states and political subdivisions of states 
held to maturity securities increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase is the result of the designation of certain mortgage backed securities  purchased in replacement of loans  as held to maturity 
management has designated these securities to secure advances from the fhlb 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity

mortgage backed securities stated using contractual maturity 
securities not designated as held to maturity are designated as available for sale 
although we do not anticipate the sale of these securities  the designation as available for sale allows us the flexibility to alter our investment strategies and sell these securities without potentially adverse accounting implications 
additionally  marketable equity securities have no maturity date must be designated as available for sale 
these securities are carried on our books and records at fair value 
the available for sale securities portfolio includes united states agency securities  agency insured mortgage backed securities  and corporate debt and equity securities 
available for sale securities increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase is the result of investment of excess funds raised in the bank s marketing campaigns and investment of funds raised from the sale of non performing loans 
the following table shows the amortized cost basis of the major categories of available for sale securities for the years indicated at december  in thousands us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies    mortgage backed securities    corporate debt securities    marketable equity securities    mutual funds with maturities  total    in the following table  the amortized cost basis of available for sale securities other than mutual funds or equity securities maturing within stated periods as of december   is shown with the weighted average interest yield from securities falling within the range of maturities us treasury mortgage corporate government backed debt dollars in thousands agencies securities securities total due in year or less amount   yield due in to years amount     yield due in to years amount    yield due after years amount   yield amount     yield mortgage backed securities stated using contractual maturity

the increase is the result of continued loan growth initiatives  designed to invest the deposits and borrowings that were raised in accordance with our strategic plans 
loan originations for were million 
during the year  we experienced loan runoff of approximately million  a higher than expected rate of runoff of existing loans  due to the result of loan sales and an active refinancing market 
we also sold approximately million of impaired and non performing commercial and commercial real estate loans 
although commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans have traditionally been our leading loan products  management has made considerable effort to diversify the loan portfolio over the past three years  adding significant levels of residential real estate loan products to the balance sheet 
management believes these loans will enhance our overall credit risk profile 
at december   our one to four family mortgage loans totaled million or of total gross loans  compared with million  or of total gross loans outstanding at december   while home equity lines of credit totaled million  or of our total gross loans  compared to million or of total gross loans at december  originations of residential real estate loans for the year ended december  totaled million  while gross home equity lines of credit totaled million 
unadvanced funds committed under home equity lines of credit totaled million at december  the commercial real estate loan portfolio was million or of total loans at december  at december   commercial real estate loans totaled million or of total gross loans 
commercial real estate loan originations totaled million for the year ended december  at december   we had million of advanced construction loans that amounted to of our total gross loans  compared to million or of total gross loans at december  construction loan originations totaled million for the year ended december  unfunded portions of construction loans totaled million at december  other commercial loans totaled million or of the total gross loan portfolio at december   compared to million or at december  the decline in the level of commercial loans is attributable to the general market conditions  as well as intensifying competition in our market area

loan portfolio rate sensitivity 
in the current period of low interest rates  the origination of adjustable rate loans has become increasingly rare 
additionally  our customer base tends to prefer fixed rate mortgage loans to adjustable rate loans 
accordingly  the portfolio of adjustable rate loans has declined significantly during the past three years 
adjustable rate mortgage loans totaled million  or of residential real estate loans 
substantially all of our equity lines of credit have interest rates that adjust monthly with the wall street journal prime rate 
additionally  the market for commercial and commercial real estate loans in our market area is intense 
in response to the competition  we offer commercial real estate loans that adjust every five years  based on either the wall street journal prime rate or the treasury rate matching the adjustment period 
of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio  million  or have adjustable interest rates 
of the total consumer loan portfolio  million have adjustable interest rates  primarily tied to the rates paid on deposit accounts

it is our policy to manage our loan portfolio in order to recognize problem loans at an early stage and thereby minimize loan losses 
loans are considered delinquent when any payment of principal or interest is one month or more past due 
we generally commence collection procedures  however  when accounts are days past due 
we place a loan on non accrual status when principal and interest payments are sporadic or no payments have been made  collateral coverage is insufficient and current financial data is not available 
generally  when a loan becomes past due days or more  management discontinues the accrual of interest and reverses previously accrued interest 
the loan remains in non accrual status until the loan is current and six consecutive months of payments are made  then it is reclassified as an accruing loan 
when a loan is determined to be uncollectible  it is charged off to the allowance for loan losses or  if applicable  any real estate that is securing the loan is acquired through foreclosure  and recorded on the our books as other real estate owned 
management defines non performing assets to include non accrual loans  loans past due days or more and still accruing  restructured loans not performing in accordance with amended terms  and other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
the following table presents information regarding non performing loans in the portfolio december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans   loans days or more past due and still accruing real estate acquired by foreclosure or substantively repossessed total non performing assets   restructured debt performing in accordance with amended terms  not included above percentage of non accrual loans to total loans percentage of non accrual loans  restructured loans and real estate acquired by foreclosure or substantively repossessed to total assets percentage of allowance for loan losses to non accrual loans  non accrual loans include restructured loans of at december    at december    at december    at december  and  at december  information with respect to non accrual and restructured loans for the past five years ending december is as follows december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans   interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income recorded during the period allowance for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged to operations based on the estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the portfolio 
management uses a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the portfolio for purposes of establishing a sufficient allowance for loan losses 
the methodology includes three elements an analysis of individual loans deemed to be impaired in accordance with the terms of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  general loss allocations for various loan types based on loss experience factors and an unallocated allowance which is maintained based on management s assessment of many factors including the risk characteristics of the portfolio  concentrations of credit  current and anticipated economic conditions that may effect borrowers ability to pay  and trends in loan delinquencies and charge offs 
realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged directly to the allowance 
while management uses the currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if future economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
as the composition of the loan portfolio gradually changes and diversifies from higher credit risk weighted loans  such as commercial real estate and commercial  financial and agricultural  to residential and home equity loans  a lower overall reserve allowance rate will be required 
during  the continued changes in the loan portfolio  stronger underwriting guidelines  the sale of commercial real estate loans previously deemed substandard  and overall improvement in credit quality of existing loans resulted in a decrease in the degree of credit risk embedded in the loan portfolio 
consequently  the allowance for loan loss remained relatively constant  decreasing from  at december  to  at december  after thorough review and analysis of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve during  we recorded a provision for loan losses of  compared to a provision benefit of  recorded for the year ended december  the increased provision is primarily the result of the growth in the loan portfolio 
loans charged off were  in compared with  for the year ended december  we realized recoveries of previously charged off loans totaling  for the year ended december  compared with recoveries totaling  for the year ended december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses of  as of december  is adequate to cover potential losses in the loan portfolio  based on current information available to management

deposits and borrowed funds we solicit depositors from our primary market area using rates and services designed to appeal to customers across a broad spectrum of ages and income levels 
we compete for deposit customers with community banks and credit unions  as well local branches regional and national banks 
despite this level of competition  our total deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
increases in savings accounts were the result of implementing our coastal product line  designed to attract high balance customers with whom we have a multiple product relationship 
time certificates of deposit increased by million when comparing the years ended december  and  primarily the result of the implementation of special priced deposits  where an off term certificate is offered at a premium rate 
during the term of the special  the customer is then presented with offers to retain the customer  and develop a multiple account relationship

the advance programs allow the bank to borrow up to of total assets  but limited  based on the amount of qualified collateral as defined by the fhlb pledged  and the amount of fhlb preferred stock held 
fhlb advances are utilized as an additional funding source for loans and investments as well as a tool for controlling the levels of interest rate risk on the balance sheet 
fhlb advances are secured by a blanket lien on qualified collateral  consisting primarily of loans with first mortgages secured by one to four family properties  certain unencumbered investment securities and other qualified assets 
short term borrowings include funds drawn under lines of credit with the fhlb  correspondent banks  funds held for us treasury tax and loan notes and fhlb advances with an original maturity of less than one year 
total short term borrowings decreased from million at december  to zero at december  at no time did the average balance of short term borrowings exceed of shareholders equity 
long term fhlb advances increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
the proceeds were utilized to fund loan and investment growth in excess of deposit growth  as well as to hedge the effects of rising short term interest rates on net interest income

in march  we issued million in subordinated debentures 
the debentures mature in  and carry an adjustable interest rate equivalent to the three month libor plus basis points 
the rate adjusts every three months based on the change in the libor 
at december  the interest rate on the subordinated debentures was 
current bank and bank holding company regulations view these debentures as tier capital 
as such  we may leverage this regulatory capital in order to expand our franchise or otherwise enhance our earnings 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily the result of increased net income of million 
the increase in net income was offset by cash dividends declared totaling million 
other factors affecting total shareholders equity include comprehensive income of  and the issuance of common stock through option and dividend reinvestment plans  totaling million 
results of operations our operating performance is dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
the level of net interest income achieved is impacted by several factors such as economic conditions  interest rates  asset liability management  and corporate tax and strategic planning

the effect of including such loans  although not material  is to reduce the average rate earned on the company s loans

the change in interest income on investments and net interest income includes interest on a fully taxable equivalent basis based on a tax rate of for  for  and for comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and we realized net income totaling million for the year ended december   equivalent to basic earnings per share of and diluted earnings per share of 
this represents a increase in net income from the year ended december   where net income totaled million  or per share basic and per share diluted 
net interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   the direct result of our growth over the year 
commensurate with loan growth  we recognized a provision for loan losses of  in  compared with a loan loss benefit of  in during the past two years  we have made concerted efforts to enhance the credit quality of our loan portfolio  and the benefit taken in was the direct result of that effort 
continuing the dedication to loan quality that management has taken has resulted in a loan loss provision that management believes is in line with its growing loan portfolio 
non interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during the same period  operating expenses remained relatively constant  at million for both the year ended december  and the year ended december  income before taxes was million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  interest income increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase can be attributed to the growth in the loan portfolio  as the average balance of loans increased by million or 
the effect of the growth in the portfolio was somewhat offset by lower interest rates on these loans  due to the unprecedented low interest rates that were present in our market area during the yield on the loan portfolio decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  interest and dividends on investments increased by  on a fully tax equivalent basis  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   also the result of the growth in the investment portfolio 
the portfolio grew from an average balance of million to million 
the portfolio continued to grow throughout the year  which  management believes  will lead to increasing interest income into income from federal funds sold and overnight deposits increased from  to  the result of increased volume of overnight money  particularly when the campaigns for deposit growth were active 
interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   resulting primarily from the increased use of borrowings in the average balance of fhlb advances increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  management took advantage of low interest rates to further grow by funding loan originations or growth in the investment portfolio 
indicative of these low rates  the average rate paid on fhlb advances decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest on deposits increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of the deposit campaigns  both for certificates of deposit and core accounts 
a marketing strategy was employed whereby certificates of deposit were offered at premium rates  then the customer was cross sold basic banking products to establish a long term relationship with the customer 
at the same time a suite of products was offered to high balance customers 
these campaigns served to increase the levels of all deposit types  including non interest bearing demand deposits 
however  the cost of interest bearing deposits rose from to 
we also issued million of subordinated debentures in march the debentures carry an interest rate equal to the three month libor plus basis points 
the effect of the issue was to increase interest expense by net interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was the result of our growth  as the continued period of low market interest rates  combined with intense competition for deposits in our market area  has compressed our net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings and funds the allowance for loan losses 
it is management s desire to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to absorb inherent losses within the loan portfolio 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  management takes into consideration past and anticipated loss experience  prevailing economic conditions  evaluations of underlying collateral  and the volume of the loan portfolio and the balance of non performing and classified loans 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
after thorough review and analysis of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve  the continued improvement in asset quality in the loan portfolio  and the reduction and sale of loans deemed substandard  management deemed it prudent to provide  for possible loan losses for the year ended december  our provision for was a benefit to earnings of  non interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase  noted in other income  can be attributed to a one time gain on the sale of impaired loans  which totaled  additionally  commissions on sales of non deposit investment products increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  in  we changed the third party through whom investment products are sold and in early  added a line of life insurance products to our non deposit investment products 
also contributing to other income was an increase in electronic banking fees of  when comparing the years ended december  and  and a  gain on the sale of fixed assets 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit account service charges from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the result of both migration of customers into free checking accounts and a decline in the total number of deposit accounts 
overdraft fees also declined from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   reflective of the decline in the number of low balance accounts 
non interest expense remained relatively constant when comparing the years ended december  and  increasing by only  or 
the small magnitude of the change is indicative of management s commitment to expense control 
in and three branches were closed  and the deposits housed therein were transferred to another branch 
as a result  salaries and employee benefits decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  occupancy expense decreased from  to  over the same period 
as we are opening the new assonet branch in  we expect salaries and employee benefits expense and occupancy expense to increase in equipment expense increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   the result of adding to our technology infrastructure 
these technology upgrades were necessary  not only to enhance security and operations  but also to support the new cash management and internet banking products  which management believes will have a positive effect on both earnings and customer retention 
stationary and supplies increased by  during the same period  primarily due to replacement costs of materials made obsolete in the technology upgrades 
professional fees increased by  when comparing the years ended december  and management anticipates that professional fees will increase in due to the costs of implementing section of the sarbanes oxley act of and implementing section for the fdic improvement act of marketing costs increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this is the result of increased advertising and promotional costs associated with our coastal product line and other deposit gathering initiatives 
fdic premiums decreased during based on the fdic s risk based assessment program 
other expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is primarily the result of a one time expense related to the directors retirement plan  resulting in an increase in the expense of  additionally  computer service fees increased by  because of implementing the cash management and internet banking products 
costs other than those mentioned above typically rose due to increases in general price levels of inflation 
income before income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  income taxes totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  representing overall tax rates of and  respectively 
the income tax rate decreased primarily because of the settlement of a dispute with the massachusetts department of revenue concerning the dividends received deduction claimed by the bank from its reit subsidiary

on a fully tax equivalent basis  net interest income was million in  compared to million in the increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the growth in the loan portfolio and the continued reduction in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and borrowings 
average earning assets produced a yield of in  compared to in  and in the low interest rate environment has resulted in a decrease in the yield on earning assets from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   as loans and investments reprice at lower interest due to refinancing opportunities and prepayments 
offsetting the decrease in the earning asset yield was a reduction of in the cost of funding the earning assets from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of funds in reflects the low interest rate environment resulting in the repricing of certificates of deposit and other deposit products to lower rates

the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal sources of funds are customer deposits  amortization and payoff of existing loan principal  and sales or maturities of various investment securities 
the bank is a voluntary member of the federal home loan bank of boston the fhlb and as such  may take advantage of the fhlb s borrowing programs to enhance liquidity and leverage its favorable capital position 
the bank also may draw on lines of credit at the fhlb or the federal reserve board the frb  and enter into repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with authorized brokers 
these various sources of liquidity are used to fund withdrawals  new loans  and investments 
management seeks to promote deposit growth while controlling cost of funds 
sales oriented programs to attract new depositors and the cross selling of various products to its existing customer base are currently in place 
management reviews  on an ongoing basis  possible new products  with particular attention to products and services  which will aid in retaining our base of lower costing deposits 
maturities and sales of investment securities provide us with significant liquidity 
our policy of purchasing shorter term debt securities reduces market risk in the bond portfolio while providing significant cash flow 
for the year ended december   cash flow from maturities of securities was million  proceeds from sales of securities totaled million  compared to maturities of securities of million  and proceeds from sales of securities of  for the year ended december  purchases of securities during and totaled million and million  respectively 
amortization and pay offs of the loan portfolio also provide us with significant liquidity 
traditionally  amortization and pay offs are reinvested into loans 
excess liquidity is invested in federal funds sold and overnight investments at the fhlb 
we have also used borrowed funds as a source of liquidity 
at december   the bank s outstanding borrowings from the fhlb were million 
the bank has the capacity to borrow in excess of million additional at the fhlb 
loan originations for the year ended december  totaled million 
commitments to originate loans at december  were million  excluding unadvanced construction funds totaling million  unadvanced commercial lines of credit totaling  million and unadvanced home equity lines totaling million 
management believes that adequate liquidity is available to fund loan commitments utilizing deposits  loan amortization  maturities of securities  or borrowings 
capital resources at december   our total shareholders equity was million  an increase of million from million reported on december  the increase in capital was a combination of several factors 
additions consisted of net income of million  comprehensive income of  transactions originating through the dividend reinvestment program whereby  net shares were issued in lieu of cash dividends or for optional cash contributions  and stock options exercised resulting in the issuance of  shares common stock at a value of  including a tax benefit 
these additions were offset by dividends paid of million 
under the requirements for risk based and leverage capital of the federal banking agencies  a minimum level of capital will vary among banks based on safety and soundness of operations 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  which include both on and off balance sheet exposure 
in addition to meeting the required levels  slade s ferry bancorp s and the bank s capital ratios meet the criteria of the well capitalized category established by the federal banking agencies as of december  and the following table illustrates the capital position of slade s ferry bancorp and slade s ferry trust company for years ending december  and slade s ferry bancorp

the definition of interest rate risk is the exposure of our earnings to adverse movements in interest rates  arising from the differences in the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities  the differences in the various pricing indices inherent in our assets and liabilities  and the effects of overt and embedded options in our assets and liabilities 
our asset liability committee  comprised of the executive management  is responsible for managing and monitoring interest rate risk  and reviewing with the board of directors  at least quarterly  the interest rate risk positions  the impact changes in interest rates would have on net interest income  and the maintenance of interest rate risk exposure within approved guidelines 
the potentially volatile nature of market interest rates requires us to manage interest rate risk on an active and dynamic basis 
our objective is to reduce and control the volatility of its net interest income to within tolerance levels established by the board of directors  by managing the relationship of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in order to manage this relationship  the asset liability committee utilizes an income simulation model to measure the net interest income at risk under differing interest rate scenarios 
additionally  the committee use economic value of equity eve analysis to measure the effects of changing interest rates on the market values of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  taken as a whole 
the board of directors and management believe that static measures of timing differences  such as gap analysis  do not accurately assess the levels of interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet 
gap analysis does not reflect the effects of overt and embedded options on net interest income  given a shift in interest rates  nor does it take into account basis risk  the risk arising from using various different indices on which to base pricing decisions 
the income simulation model currently utilizes a basis point increase in interest rates and a basis point decrease in rates 
due to the existing low interest rate environment in effect with the average federal funds overnight trading at approximately at december   the simulation model only reduces rates downward by basis points 
the interest rate movements used assume an instant and parallel change in interest rates and no implementation of any strategic plans are made in response to the change in rates 
prepayment speeds for loans are based on median dealer forecasts for each interest rate scenario 
the board of directors has established a risk limit of a change in net interest income for each number basis point shift in market interest rates 
the limit established by the board provides an internal tolerance level to control interest rate risk 
we are within our policy mandated risk limit for net interest income at risk 
the following table reflects our estimated exposure as a percentage of net interest income and the dollar impact for the next twelve months  assuming an immediate change in interest rates set forth below rate change estimated exposure as a percentage of dollar impact to net basis points net interest income interest income additionally we use the model to estimate the effects of changes in interest rates on our eve 
eve represents our theoretical market value  given the rate shocks applied in the model 
the board of directors has established a risk limit for eve which provides that the eve will not fall below  the fdic s minimum capital level to be classified as well capitalized 
we are within our risk limit for eve
