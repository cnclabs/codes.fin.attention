overview the company provides credit insurance and financial services to mortgage lenders and other global financial institutions 
as a holder of credit risk  the company s results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the credit performance of the underlying insured assets 
the company generally experienced favorable results for  although the operating environment for mortgage insurance and financial guaranty insurance continued to present difficulties 
the results of the company s mortgage insurance business trended positively  even with the continuation of the unprecedented refinance wave that has caused continued high cancellation rates and has negatively impacted insurance in force 
claims appear to have leveled off and  over the course of  there was a reduction in delinquencies  which is a leading indicator of future claims 
the mortgage insurance mix of business has continued to include lower credit profile business such as alternative a alt a and a minus mortgages and new products such as interest only loans 
this is considered the growth area of the market as some of the prime mortgage market continues to be absorbed by and other hybrid products that do not typically include mortgage insurance 
the company expects to continue to increase its insurance of new and emerging products that the company has less experience with  which adds to the uncertainty of future credit performance 
the financial guaranty business continued to slowly recover from setbacks caused by a large loss on a manufactured housing transaction  the clawback of significant reinsurance business by one of its customers in the first quarter of and the impending clawback of a smaller piece of business by another customer in the first quarter of the year showed another period of unprecedented earnings strength and growth and return on investment for the financial services segment  some of which was a result of the low interest rate environment and a favorable environment for the issuers of asset backed securities 

table of contents the company believes that its diversified credit enhancement and prudent capital management strategies are sound and intends to continue to implement these strategies 
the company sees a convergence between the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty markets  with an emphasis on structured credit enhancement products 
in the mortgage insurance business  the company is hopeful that an economic recovery and job growth can positively impact performance and that modestly rising interest rates will help reduce cancellation rates  although these macroeconomic factors are outside of the company s control 
the company will continue to be challenged to solidify the aa financial guaranty business platform by continuing to demonstrate the ability to grow and write quality business 
this will be difficult in a competitive  tight credit spread environment 
the company expects to increase its efforts in the global markets for both mortgage and financial guaranty business to allow it to take advantage of its core competencies of credit risk analysis and capital allocation to write profitable business in europe and asia 
in november  the company announced that its chairman and chief executive officer  frank filipps  intends to retire on or before june  the board of directors has formed a special committee to lead the selection of mr 
filipps successor and the committee has begun that process  which will include both external and internal candidates

the impact of including these shares in the calculation was a reduction of per share for and per share for the results for reflect an immediate reduction in net income of million or per share in the first quarter of related to the recapture of business previously ceded to the company by one of the primary insurer customers of the financial guaranty segment 
this recapture of previously ceded business also resulted in the loss of premiums that would have been earned over the balance of and the avoidance of losses that would have been incurred on the recaptured business  and that would have resulted in an estimated additional per share of net income over that period 
net income for includes an increase of million compared to due to the inclusion of million in gains on sales of investments and million for the change in fair value of derivative instruments compared to million and million  respectively  for net income for also includes an increase of million resulting from a reduction in the provision for losses in compared to primarily from the inclusion of a million charge in the fourth quarter of for an insurance policy related to manufactured housing loans originated by conseco finance corp

equity in net income of affiliates increased to million from million in equity in net income of affiliates includes the results of credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass  sherman financial services group llc sherman and  until september   primus guaranty  ltd  a bermuda holding company and parent to primus financial products  llc  primus 
in september  primus issued shares of its common stock in an initial public offering 
the company sold a portion of its shares in primus as part of this offering and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million on the sale 
the sale of its shares reduced the company s investment in primus to approximately 
as a result of the company s reduced ownership and influence over primus after it became a public company  the company moved its investment in primus to its equity securities portfolio and  as such  began recording changes in market value from primus securities as other comprehensive income rather than recording income or loss as equity in net income of affiliates beginning with the fourth quarter of consolidated net premiums written for were  million  compared to  million for the amount of net premiums written reported in reflects a reduction of million of financial guaranty written premiums related to the first quarter recapture of business by one primary insurer  which also reduced earned premiums by million 
net premiums earned for were  million  an increase of million or from the  million recorded in net investment income of million for increased million or from million in  primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio funded by continued positive operating cash flows 
the company has continued to invest some of its net operating cash flow in tax advantaged securities  primarily municipal bonds  although the company s investment policy allows the purchase of various other asset classes  including common stock and convertible securities 
the company s common equity exposure is targeted at a maximum of of the investment portfolio s market value  while the investment grade convertible securities and investment grade taxable bond exposures are each targeted not to exceed

the provision for losses was million for  a net decrease of million or from million in the decrease in the provision for losses in resulted primarily from the million attributable to conseco finance corp 
in  partially offset by a million increase in the provision for losses to support the million increase in claims paid by mortgage insurance in policy acquisition costs for were million  down million or from million in the amount reported in reflects the million reduction of financial guaranty acquisition costs resulting from the recapture of previously written business by one primary insurer customer in the first quarter of also included in the amount reported in was a charge of million related to an acceleration of deferred policy acquisition cost amortization in the mortgage insurance business resulting from high cancellation rates and higher default rates 
other operating expenses of million for decreased million or from million in other operating expenses in included higher information technology it expenditures and the amortization of it projects that were placed into service in  as well as increased compliance costs  including sarbanes oxley compliance 
other operating expenses for included the million charge for the cessation of operations at radianexpress  as well as normal operating expenses of radianexpress of million up to the time of its cessation of business 
the million charge includes the write off of the carrying cost of the investment of million and provisions for severance  leasehold commitments and other charges of million 
interest expense of million for decreased million from million in due to the positive impact of the interest rate swap that the company entered into in the second quarter of  which effectively converted the interest rate on the company s senior notes due to a variable rate based on a spread over the london interbank offered rate libor 
the consolidated effective tax rate was 
table of contents and for and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for reflects a higher proportion of tax exempt income to total income resulting from the overall decline in earnings as a result of the charge for conseco finance corp

this clawback affected the first quarter and  as a result  the year to date period of accordingly  management believes that column provides useful information to investors by presenting a more meaningful basis of comparison for the company s past and future results

the impact of including these shares in the calculation was a reduction of per share for and per share for the overall decline in net income was principally a result of a million increase in the provision for losses  as discussed below 
insurance in force for the mortgage insurance business segment increased from billion at december  to billion at december  total net debt service outstanding par plus interest on transactions insured by financial guaranty increased from billion at december  to billion at december  these increases in business volumes produced increases in written and earned premiums  investment income and other income 
increased revenues were offset by increases in policy acquisition costs  other operating expenses and interest expense to support the higher business volumes 
equity in net income of affiliates increased by million in to million from the million recorded in 
table of contents  primarily due to strong results at c bass and sherman 
equity in net income of affiliates for also included million pre tax related to the company s investment in primus 
the results of primus for were immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
consolidated earned premiums for of  million represented an increase of million or from million in mortgage insurance contributed million of this increase and financial guaranty contributed million 
net investment income of million for increased million or from million in this increase was primarily due to a large increase in the investment portfolio balance  some of which resulted from the issuance of million of notes in the first quarter of  partially offset by lower investment yields 
other income increased to million in from million in  primarily related to increased contract underwriting income in the mortgage insurance segment 
the provision for losses was million for  an increase of million or from million in approximately million of this increase was related to mortgage insurance to support an increase in claims payments and delinquency rates  and million was related to financial guaranty  of which million was added during the fourth quarter of in anticipation of approximately million in claims from a single manufactured housing transaction originated and serviced by conseco finance corp 
the remaining reserve increase was at financial guaranty to support business growth and an increase in trade credit reinsurance claims 
policy acquisition costs for were million  up million or from million in other operating expenses of million for increased million or from million in included in operating expenses in was a million charge for the cessation of operations of radianexpress 
the company recorded a pension gain of million in related to the curtailment of financial guaranty s pension plan 
interest expense of million for increased from million in as a result of interest payments on million of long term debt issued in february the company s consolidated effective tax rate was for compared to for the decline in the effective tax rate in resulted from a higher proportion of tax exempt securities as compared to taxable income 
mortgage insurance results of operations mortgage insurance s net income for was million  a decrease of million or from million in this decrease was due to increases in the provision for losses  policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses  as well as a decrease in other income  partially offset by an increase in earned premiums  net investment income  gains on sales of investments and the change in fair value of derivative instruments 
although home purchases have increased  the mortgage insurance industry did not benefit from this increase as it relates to insurance written due to equity appreciation  which decreased the percentage of loans requiring mortgage insurance  and an increase in alternative mortgage executions that exclude mortgage insurance  particularly so called arrangements 
in addition  refinance activity remained high  which often results in the elimination of mortgage insurance on the refinanced loan  reducing volume in throughout the industry 
primary new insurance written during was billion  a decrease from billion written in this decrease in mortgage insurance s primary new insurance written in was primarily due to a smaller overall market which led to a large decrease in insurance written both through flow business loans insured on an individual basis and structured transactions 
during  mortgage insurance wrote billion in structured transactions compared to billion in the amount originated in included a large structured transaction for one customer composed of prime mortgage loans originated throughout the united states 
the company s participation in the structured transactions market is likely to vary significantly from year to year because the company competes with other mortgage insurers  as well as capital market executions  for these transactions 
in  mortgage insurance wrote million of pool insurance risk compared to million in a lower level of structured transactions  which includes those composed of pool insurance risk  and a lower level of gse pool risk written  contributed to this decline 
the large transaction in referred to above also included a portion of the risk written as pool insurance coverage 

table of contents mortgage insurance is dependent on a small number of lenders for providing a substantial portion of its business 
mortgage insurance s top lenders were responsible for of the direct primary risk in force at december  the top lenders were also responsible for of primary new insurance written in the largest single customer of mortgage insurance including branches and affiliates of such customer  measured by new insurance written  accounted for of new insurance written during  compared to in the concentration of business with lenders may increase or decrease as a result of many factors 
these lenders may reduce the amount of business currently given to mortgage insurance or cease doing business with it altogether 
mortgage insurance s master policies and related lender agreements do not  and by law cannot  require lenders to do business with it 
the loss of business from a major lender could materially adversely affect mortgage insurance s and the company s business and financial results 
the company expects customer concentration to be a continuous trend as a result of the ongoing consolidation in the financial services industry in general and the mortgage industry in particular 
the highest state concentration of risk is california at 
at december   california also accounted for of mortgage insurance s total direct primary insurance in force and of mortgage insurance s direct primary new insurance written for mortgage insurance s volume in continued to be impacted by lower interest rates that affected the entire mortgage insurance industry 
the continued low interest rate environment caused refinancing activity to remain relatively high  although not as high as in mortgage insurance s refinancing activity as a percentage of primary new insurance written was for compared to for the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of insurance in force that remains on the company s books after any month period  was for the months ended december   compared to for the months ended december  this increase in the persistency rate reflects a decline in refinancing activity during the company s expectation for is that persistency rates will continue to slowly rise throughout the year  influenced by relatively stable or slowly rising interest rates 
net premiums earned by mortgage insurance in were million  a million or increase from million for the net premiums earned in reflect an increase in premiums from non traditional new insurance volume in radian insurance and amerin guaranty 
certain portions of this business are included in other risk in force and include a high percentage of credit enhancements on net interest margin securities nims and second lien mortgage insurance business 
during the second quarter of  the company announced its intent to reduce the amount of second lien business it expected to originate in the future  but the company continues to evaluate this decision and may increase its participation in second lien business if it believes it can do so at acceptable levels of risk and return 
premiums earned in radian insurance and amerin guaranty  primarily from credit insurance on mortgage related assets and second mortgages  were million in  compared to million in and million in during and continuing into  mortgage insurance also experienced a change in the mix of new insurance written 
the mix now includes a higher percentage of non prime business  which has higher premium rates intended to compensate for the increased level of expected loss associated with this type of insurance 
direct primary insurance in force was billion at december   compared to billion at december  total pool risk in force was billion at december  and december  other risk in force in radian insurance and amerin guaranty was billion at december  and billion at december  the office of federal housing enterprise oversight issued new risk based capital regulations for fannie mae and freddie mac  which took effect september  the most relevant provision to the company is a distinction between aaa rated insurers and aa rated insurers 
the new regulations impose a credit haircut that fannie mae and freddie mac are given for exposure ceded to aaa insurers by and to aa insurers by 
currently  radian guaranty is rated aa  one other mortgage insurance provider is rated aaa 
as a result  there may be an incentive for the gses to use private mortgage insurance provided by a aaa rated insurer 
the provisions of the new regulations are being phased in over a year period commencing on the effective date of the regulation 
there has been no noticeable impact on the company as a result of this change 

table of contents in addition to insuring prime loans  mortgage insurance insures non traditional loans  primarily alt a and a minus loans collectively  referred to as non prime business 
alt a borrowers generally have a similar credit profile to the company s prime borrowers  but these loans are underwritten with reduced documentation and verification of information 
the company typically charges a higher premium rate for alt a business due to reduced or no documentation 
alt a loans tend to have higher balances than other loans insured by mortgage insurance 
the company considers alt a loans to be more risky than prime business  particularly alt a loans to borrowers with fico credit scores below the company also insures alt a loans with fico scores ranging from to  but the company has measures in place to limit this exposure and it charges a significantly higher premium for the level of increased risk 
although the company previously has disclosed an intent to reduce its insurance of lower fico alt a loans  the company continually re evaluates this decision and will increase its participation in this business if it believes it can do so at acceptable levels of risk and return 
the company s a minus loan programs typically have non traditional credit standards that are less stringent than standard credit guidelines and include loans to borrowers with fico scores ranging from to in an attempt to compensate for this additional risk  the company receives a higher premium for insuring this product  which the company believes is commensurate with the additional default risk 
during  non prime business accounted for billion or of mortgage insurance s new primary insurance written compared to billion or for of the billion of non prime business written for  billion or was alt a 
at december   non prime insurance in force was billion or of total primary insurance in force  compared to billion or for of the billion of non prime insurance in force at december   billion or was alt a 
the company anticipates that the trend of a significant and  perhaps  increasing mix of non prime mortgage insurance business and non traditional insurance products will continue as a result of structural changes and competitive products in the mortgage lending and mortgage insurance businesses 
in the third quarter of  the company developed an innovative way to reinsure its unexpected losses and to manage its internal credit limits through unaffiliated reinsurance companies funded by the issuance of credit linked notes in the capital markets 
on august   the company entered into a reinsurance agreement under which it ceded a significant portion of the risk associated with an million portfolio of first lien  non prime residential mortgage loans insured by the company 
the company s counterparty under the reinsurance agreement is smart home reinsurance limited smart home  a bermuda reinsurance company that is not affiliated with the company  which was formed solely to enter into the reinsurance arrangement 
smart home was funded in the capital markets by its issuance of credit linked notes rated between aa and bb by s p  and between aa and ba by moody s  that were issued in separate classes related to loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio 
the company anticipates retaining the risk associated with the first loss coverage levels  and may retain or sell  in a separate risk transfer agreement  the risk associated with the aaa rated coverage level 
holders of the smart home credit linked notes bear the risk of loss from losses paid to the company under the reinsurance agreement 
smart home will invest the proceeds of the notes in high quality short term investments approved by s p and moody s 
income earned on those investments and a portion of the reinsurance premiums paid by the company will be applied to pay interest on the notes as well as certain of smart home s expenses 
the liquidation proceeds from the investments will be used to pay reinsured loss amounts to the company  and any remaining proceeds will be applied to pay principal on the notes 
in february  the company completed a second reinsurance arrangement under which it ceded a portion of the risk associated with a billion portfolio of first lien  non prime residential mortgages insured by the company 
mortgage insurance and other companies in the industry have entered into risk revenue sharing arrangements with various customers that are designed to allow the customer to participate in the risks and rewards of the mortgage insurance business 
one such product is captive reinsurance  in which a mortgage lender establishes a mortgage reinsurance company that assumes part of the risk associated with that lender s mortgages that are insured on a flow basis 
in return for the reinsurance company s assumption of risk  the mortgage insurer cedes a portion of its mortgage insurance premiums to the reinsurance company 
in most cases  the risk assumed 
table of contents by the reinsurance company is an excess layer of aggregate losses that would be penetrated only in a situation of adverse loss development  in effect providing the mortgage insurer with a form of stressed loss coverage 
for  premiums ceded under captive reinsurance arrangements were million  or of total premiums earned during  compared to million  or of total premiums earned for new primary insurance written under captive reinsurance arrangements was billion  or of total new primary insurance written in compared to billion  or of total new primary insurance written in these percentages can be volatile as a result of increases or decreases in structured transactions  such as has occurred over the last several quarters 
primary insurance written in structured transactions is not typically eligible for captive reinsurance arrangements 
captive reinsurance arrangements continue to grow in popularity  and a larger percentage of the company s business participates in these arrangements at increasing percentage levels 
because of many factors  including the incentives for mortgage lenders to funnel relatively higher quality loans through the captive reinsurer  the company continues to evaluate the level of revenue sharing against risk sharing on a customer by customer basis as part of its customer profitability analysis 
net investment income attributable to mortgage insurance for was million  an increase of million or compared to million for this increase was the result of continued growth in invested assets primarily due to positive operating cash flows and the allocation of interest income from the parent company 
the provision for losses was million for  an increase of million or from million in  primarily to support an increase in claims paid and a higher mix of non traditional insured loans in default that have a higher probability of going to claim 
the seasoning of this higher mix of non traditional insured loans resulted in an increase in claims coupled with higher delinquency or default rates 
the default and claim cycle in the mortgage insurance business begins with the company s receipt of a default notice from the insured 
generally  the master policy of insurance requires the insured to notify the company of a default within days after the loan has become days past due 
claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business 
relatively few claims on prime business are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy and on non prime business during the first year 
historically  claim activity on prime loans has reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of policy origination  and on non prime loans this level is expected to be reached in the second through fourth years 
approximately of the primary risk in force and approximately of the pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its highest claim frequency years 
because it is difficult to predict both the timing of originating new business and the run off rate of existing business  it also is difficult to predict  at any given time  the percentage of risk in force that will reach its highest claim frequency years on any future date 
the combined default rate for both primary and pool insurance  excluding second lien insurance coverage  was at december   compared to at december   while the default rate on the primary business was at december  compared to at december  the total number of loans in default decreased from  at december  to  at december  the average loss reserve per default increased from  at the end of to  at december  the loss reserve as a percentage of risk in force was at december   compared to at december  the non prime mortgage insurance business has experienced a consistent increase in the number of defaults in the past 
although the default rate on this business is higher than on prime business  higher premium rates charged for non prime business are expected to compensate for the increased level of expected losses associated with this business 
the number of non prime loans in default at december  was  which represented of the total primary loans in default  compared to  non prime loans in default at december   which represented of the total primary loans in default 
the default rate on the alt a business was at december  compared to at december  the default rate on the a minus and below loans was at december  compared to at december  it is too early to determine with certainty whether the increased premiums charged on non prime business will compensate for the ultimate losses on the non prime business 
the default rate on the prime business was and at december  and december   respectively 
the default rate on non prime 
table of contents business increased basis points to at december  from at december  as a result of that business seasoning  with the default rate on the prime business down basis points from december  a strong economy generally results in better default rates and a decrease in the overall level of losses 
a weakening of the economy could negatively impact the company s overall default rates  which would result in an increase in the provision for losses 
direct claims paid for were million compared to million for the average claim paid has increased over the past few years due primarily to deeper coverage amounts and larger loan balances 
alt a loans have a significantly higher average claim payment due to higher loan balances and greater coverage percentages 
in addition  claims paid in have been impacted by the rise in delinquencies in and that have proceeded to foreclosure 
claims paid on second lien mortgages increased year over year as a result of the increase in the volume of business written in  for which the company began paying claims in a disproportionately higher incidence of claims in georgia is directly related to what the company s risk management department believes to be questionable property value estimates in that state 
the company s risk management department put into place several property valuation checks and balances to mitigate the risk of this issue recurring and applies these same techniques to all mortgage insurance transactions 
the company expects this higher incidence of claims in georgia to continue until loans originated in georgia prior to the implementation of these preventive measures become sufficiently seasoned 
a higher level of claim incidence in texas resulted  in part  from unemployment levels that were higher than the national average and from lower home price appreciation 
the company believes that claims in the midwest and southeast have been rising and will continue to rise due to the weak industrial sector of the economy 
the company anticipates that overall claim payments in will be in line with or slightly up from policy acquisition costs relate directly to the acquisition of new business 
other operating expenses consist primarily of contract underwriting expenses  overhead and administrative costs  some of which are allocated to the various business segments from the parent company 
policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were million in  an increase of million or compared to million for policy acquisition costs were million in  an increase of million or from million in the amortization of these expenses is related to the recognition of gross profits over the life of the policies and is influenced by such factors as persistency and estimated loss rates 
during the third quarter and fourth quarter of  the company accelerated million of the amortization of policy acquisition costs due to the substantial run off in prior years books of business which impacted the projected future gross profits 
much of the amortization in represents costs that were incurred in or the effects of the acceleration described above 
other operating expenses were million for  an increase of million or from million for primarily as a result of increased depreciation on it projects that were put into service in the latter part of and during and costs related to the company s capital market reinsurance transactions with smart home 
in  other operating expenses also included an increase in the reserve for contract underwriting remedies 
during  the company processed requests for remedies on less than of loans underwritten but  as a result of increased underwriting in the previous two years  which significantly increased the company s exposure to underwriting errors  a strengthening of the contract underwriting reserve for remedies was necessary

factors influencing this consideration include an analysis of the security issuer s financial 
table of contents performance  financial condition and general economic conditions

recently  the company has experienced a trend toward a reduction in cash flow from operations compared to net income  primarily because an increasing portion of the company s net income has been derived from the company s equity in earnings of affiliates  which does not represent cash flow 
this trend also has resulted because of rising costs imposed by infrastructure and regulatory requirements and because the company has been required to use more operating cash to pay taxes currently 
this trend is exaggerated in periods like the first quarters of and  which experienced or will experience the immediate impact of the exercise of recapture rights by financial guaranty reinsurance customers 
the company does not expect net income to greatly exceed cash flows in periods that are not impacted by the exercise of such recapture rights

critical accounting policies sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including the company s past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses as described in notes and to consolidated financial statements  the company establishes reserves to provide for losses and the estimated costs of settling claims in both the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
in the mortgage insurance business  reserves for losses generally are not established until the company is notified that a borrower has missed two payments 
the company also establishes reserves for associated loss adjustment expenses lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses 
the company maintains an extensive database of claim payment history and uses historical models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer and macroeconomic factors such as regional economic conditions that involve significant variability over time  as well as more static factors such as the estimated foreclosure period in the area where the default exists  to help determine the appropriate loss reserve at any point in time 
with respect to delinquent loans that are in an early stage of delinquency  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 

table of contents adjustments in estimates for delinquent loans in the early stage of delinquency are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of delinquency 
as the delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the delinquent loan and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
if a default cures  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
this curing process causes an appearance of a reduction in reserves from prior years if the reduction in reserves from cures is greater than the additional reserves for those loans that are nearing foreclosure or have become claims 
the company also reserves for defaults that the company believes to have occurred but that have not been reported  using historical information on defaults not reported on a timely basis by lending institutions 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
the company does not establish reserves for mortgages that are in default if the company believes it will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
consistent with gaap and industry accounting practices  the company does not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default or believed to be in default 
the company establishes loss reserves on its non derivative financial guaranty contracts as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as discussed below  the reserving policies used by the financial guaranty industry are continuing to evolve and are subject to change 
the company s financial guaranty loss reserve policy requires management to make the following key estimates and judgments setting both case reserves and allocated non specific reserves requires the company to exercise judgment in estimating the severity of the claim that is likely to result from an identified reserving event  which may be any amount up to the full amount of the insured obligation 
the reliability of this estimate depends on the reliability of the information regarding the likely severity of the claim and the judgments made by management with respect to that information 
even when the company is aware of the occurrence of an event that requires the establishment of a reserve  the company s estimate of the severity of the claim that is likely to result from that event may not be correct 
at december   the company had case reserves of million 
of this amount  million was attributable to a single manufactured housing transaction originated and serviced by conseco finance corp 
the company has a high degree of certainty that it will suffer losses with respect to this insured obligation equal to the amount reserved  which equals the total amount of the remaining insured obligation 
the case reserves also include million attributable to reinsured obligations on which the company s total par outstanding is million 
these reserves are established based on amounts conveyed to the company by the ceding companies and confirmed by the company and the company does not have any reasonable expectation that the ultimate losses will deviate materially from the amount reserved 
the remaining million of case reserves is attributable to two insured obligations with a total par outstanding of million  and the company does not have any reasonable expectation that the ultimate losses will deviate materially from the amount reserved 
at december   one credit was included in the company s allocated non specific reserves 
the company has a high degree of certainty that it will suffer losses with respect to this insured obligation equal to the amount reserved  which is the total million par amount of the insured obligation 
the company s unallocated non specific reserves are established over time by applying expected default factors to the premiums earned during each reporting period on each credit for which the company has not established a case reserve or an allocated non specific reserve 
the expected default factor for each credit is derived by dividing the expected losses on that credit over its life by the premiums expected to be earned on that credit over its life 
the expected life time losses for each credit are determined by multiplying the expected frequency of losses on that credit by the expected severity of losses on that credit and multiplying this number  the loss factor  by that credit s outstanding par amount 
the expected frequency and severity of losses for each credit are generated from three sources two that are published by major rating agencies and one that is generated by a proprietary internal model based on the product class  published rating and term to maturity for each credit 
the company sets the expected life time losses for each credit at the approximate 
table of contents mid point of the range between the highest and lowest expected life time loss factors generated by the rating agency and internally generated models 
the default rates published by rating agencies tend to be very low because the company primarily insures investment grade obligations that  historically  have a very low probability of default 
although the default rate is low  the amount of losses upon default can be very high because the company tends to insure large financial obligations 
because of the low incidence of losses on financial guaranty obligations  it is also very difficult to estimate the timing of losses on the company s insured obligations for which the company has not yet established a case reserve or allocated non specific reserve 
the default factors for the years ended december   and approximated of earned premiums on public finance credits and of earned premiums on structured finance credits 
the company s unallocated non specific loss reserve at december  was million 
the range between the unallocated non specific reserves that would have resulted from applying the highest and lowest default factors generated by any of the three models was approximately million to million  which the company believes provides a reasonably likely range of expected losses 
none of the product types insured by the company accounted for a materially disproportionate share of the variability within that range 
at each balance sheet date  the company also evaluates both the model generated default factors and its unallocated non specific reserves against management s subjective view of qualitative factors to ensure that the default factors and the unallocated non specific reserves represent management s best estimate of the expected losses on the company s portfolio of credits for which it has not established a case reserve or an allocated non specific reserve 
these qualitative factors include existing economic and business conditions  overall credit quality trends resulting from industry  geographic  economic and political conditions  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  changes in underwriting policies and procedures and seasoning of the book of business 
the macroeconomic factors that the company evaluates are outside of the company s control and are subject to considerable variability 
the company specific factors that the company evaluates also require the company to make subjective judgments 
in addition  a significant change in the size of the company s portfolio underlying the unallocated non specific reserves  such as through the expiration of policies or the refunding or recapture of insured exposures  could require an adjustment to the default factors or the company s level of unallocated non specific reserves 
to date  the company s evaluation of these qualitative factors has not led the company to adjust the default factors or its level of unallocated non specific reserves 
the company s estimates of its reserves for losses and lae for financial guaranty s other lines of business  primarily trade credit reinsurance  depend upon the receipt of accurate reports and individual loss estimates from ceding companies 
the time lag in receiving reports on individual loss estimates in trade credit reinsurance is generally three to six months 
the company uses historical loss information and makes inquiries to the cedants of known events as a means of validating its loss assumptions while awaiting more formal updated reports 
any differences in viewpoints are resolved expeditiously and have historically not resulted in material adjustments 
in addition  a reserve is included for losses and lae incurred but not reported ibnr  on trade credit insurance 
setting the loss reserves in both business segments involves significant reliance upon estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
the models and estimates the company uses to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
there can be no assurance that the company has correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
in january and february of  the company discussed with the sec staff  both separately and together with other members of the financial guaranty industry  the differences in loss reserve practices followed by different financial guaranty industry participants 
the company understands from those discussions that the financial accounting standards board the fasb staff is considering whether additional accounting guidance is necessary to address the financial guaranty industry 
when and if the fasb or the sec reaches a conclusion on this issue  the company and the rest of the financial guaranty industry may be required to change some aspects of their accounting policies 
if the fasb or the sec were to determine that the company should account for its financial guaranty contracts differently  for example by requiring them to be treated solely as one or the 
table of contents other of short duration or long duration contracts under sfas no 
 this determination could impact the company s accounting for loss reserves  premium revenue and deferred acquisition costs  all of which are covered by sfas no 
management is unable to estimate what impact  if any  the ultimate resolution of this issue will have on the company s financial condition or operating results 
derivative instruments and hedging activity the company accounts for derivatives under sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
the convertible debt securities included in the company s investment portfolio and certain of the company s financial guaranty contracts are considered derivatives 
under sfas no 
 the convertible debt and redeemable preferred securities included in the company s investment portfolio must be characterized as hybrid securities because they generally combine both debt and equity characteristics 
the hybrid classification requires that the convertible security valuation be separated into a fixed income component and an equity derivative component 
valuation changes on the fixed income component are recorded as other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets while valuation changes on the equity derivative component are recorded as gains and losses on the statements of income 
the company believes that the market valuation of each hybrid convertible security is appropriately allocated to its fixed income and equity derivative components 
the gains and losses on direct derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models 
the gains and losses on assumed derivative financial guaranty contracts are provided by the primary insurance companies 
estimated fair value amounts are determined by the company using market information to the extent available  and appropriate valuation methodologies 
significant differences may exist with respect to the available market information and assumptions used to determine gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange due to the lack of a liquid market 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
a summary of the company s derivative information as of and for the periods indicated is as follows december in millions balance sheet trading securities amortized cost fair value derivative financial guaranty contracts notional value gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses net unrealized gains losses the components of the change in fair value of derivative instruments are as follows year ended december in millions income statement trading securities derivative financial guaranty contracts net gains losses 
table of contents the following table presents information at december  and related to net unrealized gains losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
december december in millions balance at january net unrealized gains losses recorded settlements of derivatives contracts receipts payments balance at december the application of sfas no 
 as amended  could result in volatility from period to period in gains and losses as reported on the company s consolidated statements of income 
these gains and losses result primarily from changes in corporate credit spreads  changes in the creditworthiness of underlying corporate entities  and the equity performance of the entities underlying the convertible investments 
the company is unable to predict the effect this volatility may have on its financial position or results of operations 
the company records premiums and origination costs related to credit default swaps and certain other financial guaranty contracts in premiums written and policy acquisition costs  respectively  on the consolidated statements of income 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial guaranty results of operations 
the company s classification of these contracts is the same whether the company is a direct writer or the company assumes these contracts 
the company has entered into a derivative to hedge the interest rate risk related to the issuance of certain long term debt in accordance with the company s risk management policies 
as of december   there were two interest rate swaps 
the interest rate swaps have been designed as fair value hedges and hedge the change in fair value of the debt arising from interest rate movements 
during  the fair value hedge was effective 
therefore  the changes in the derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income were offset by the change in the fair value of the hedged debt 
this interest rate swap contracts mature in february terms of the interest rate swap contracts at december  were as follows dollars in thousands notional amount rate received fixed rate paid floating a maturity date february  unrealized gain a the december  six month libor forward rate at the next swap payment date plus basis points 
in october  the company entered into transactions to lock in treasury rates that would have served as a hedge in the event the company issued long term debt 
the notional value of the hedges is million at a blended rate of 
at december   the company had a million unrealized gain recorded on the hedges 
in january  the company discontinued the hedge arrangements and received payments from its counterparties 
the company realized a gain of million at termination in 
table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance business  consisting of compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and reported as deferred policy acquisition costs 
because sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  amortization of these costs for each underwriting year book of business is charged against revenue in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
this includes accruing interest on the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs 
estimates of expected gross profit including persistency and loss development assumptions for each underwriting year used as a basis for amortization are evaluated regularly  and the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted by a charge or credit to the statement of earnings if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
considerable judgment is used in evaluating these factors when updating the assumptions 
the use of different assumptions would have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
in  as a result of these evaluations  the company accelerated the amortization of million of deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs in the financial guaranty business are comprised of those expenses that vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of insurance premiums  including commissions paid on reinsurance assumed  salaries and related costs of underwriting and marketing personnel  rating agency fees  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses  offset by commission income on premiums ceded to reinsurers 
acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned for each underwriting year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is adjusted regularly based on the expected timing of both upfront and installment based premiums 
the estimation of installment based premiums requires considerable judgment and different assumptions could produce different results

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages its investment portfolio to achieve safety and liquidity  while seeking to maximize total return 
the company believes it can achieve these objectives by active portfolio management and intensive monitoring of investments 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risk related to financial instruments primarily relates to the investment portfolio  which exposes the company to risks related to interest rates  default  prepayments  and declines in equity prices 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
the company views these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability management 
the company s analysts estimate the payout pattern of the mortgage insurance loss reserves to determine their duration  which are the weighted average payments expressed in years 
the company sets duration targets for fixed income investment portfolios that it believes mitigate the overall effect of interest rate risk 
in april  the company entered into an interest rate swap that  in effect  converted a portion of the fixed rate long term debt to a spread over the six month libor for the remaining term of the debt 
as of december   the average duration of the fixed income portfolio was years
