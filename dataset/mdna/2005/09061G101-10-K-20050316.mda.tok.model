item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the other information in this form k  investors should carefully consider the following discussion and the information under factors that may affect future results when evaluating us and our business 
overview we develop and commercialize innovative biopharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical conditions 
we select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant medical need  have well understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first to market 
our product portfolio is comprised of two approved products and multiple investigational product candidates 
aldurazyme laronidase  has been approved for marketing in the us by the us  in the us by the emea and other countries for the treatment of mps i 
we have developed aldurazyme through a joint venture with genzyme 
aldurazyme net revenue recorded by our joint venture during totaled million compared to million in there were commercial aldurazyme patients as of december   compared to as of december  in may  we completed the transaction to acquire the business of ascent pediatrics from medicis 
the ascent pediatrics business includes orapred prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution  a patent protected drug to treat asthma in children and other inflammatory conditions  two additional proprietary formulations of orapred in development  and a us based sales force 
orapred net product sales during totaled million following the acquisition in may we are developing several other product candidates for the treatment of genetic diseases including rhasb galsulfase for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis vi mps vi  phenoptin r bh  a proprietary oral form of tetrahydrobiopterin for the treatment of moderate to mild forms of phenylketonuria pku  and phenylase recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase  a preclinical candidate for the treatment of the more severe form of pku 
our research and development expense during  primarily related to the development of rhasb and phenoptin  totaled million compared to million in our net loss totaled million for compared to million in our net loss includes million of orapred acquisition related and impairment expenses 
our cash burn  a non generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measure  in was million as compared to million in  and our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  currently restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  non gaap financial measures the discussion above includes cash burn a non gaap financial measure 
we define cash burn as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents as determined in accordance with gaap excluding the effect of capital markets financing activities  the purchase and sale of short term investments as determined in accordance with gaap  the net increase or decrease in restricted cash as determined in accordance with gaap and the net increase or decrease in cash balances related to long term debt as determined in accordance with gaap 
cash burn for the periods presented was determined as follows net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net purchases sales of short term investments increase in restricted cash increase in cash balances related to long term debt net proceeds from capital market financings cash burn 
table of contents we use short term investments as an investment vehicle for our cash and cash equivalents  and the distinction between cash and cash equivalents is determined based on the duration of the investment 
we manage our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as a common pool 
the effect on net increase or decrease in cash because of the purchase and sale of short term investments is impossible to predict and does not have a material effect on our liquidity or total current assets since short term investments are usually bonds and notes held to maturity 
therefore  for purposes of determining cash burn  we do not give effect to the purchase and sale of short term investments and assume that the net effect of the purchase and sale of short term investments will be zero 
the net increase or decrease in restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt represent changes in our cash balances but not use of cash in our operations 
we believe that cash burn  although a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information to investors by showing the net cash expended in most aspects of our activities 
we also believe that the presentation of this non gaap financial measure is consistent with our past practice  as well as industry practice in general  and will enable investors  analysts and readers of our financial statements to compare current non gaap measures with non gaap measures presented in prior periods 
any non gaap financial measure used by us should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net losses  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
unless otherwise noted below  there have not been any recent changes to our assumptions  judgments or estimates included in our critical accounting policies 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for our equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  income taxes  inventory  research and development  and stock option plans have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
investment in and advances to biomarin genzyme llc and equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc we account for our joint venture investment using the equity method 
accordingly  we record an increase in our investment for contributions to the joint venture and a reduction in our investment for our share of the loss of the joint venture 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s loss for the period 
advances to biomarin genzyme llc include the current receivable from the joint venture for the reimbursement related to our services provided to the joint venture and the investment in biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s cash  accounts receivable and inventory 
a critical accounting estimate by management associated with our accounting for the joint venture is the realizability of our investment in the joint venture 
the joint venture has incurred significant losses to date 
we believe that our investment in the joint venture will be recovered because we project that the joint venture will achieve positive earnings and cash flows 
we and our joint venture partner maintain the ability and intent to fund the joint venture s operations 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we regularly review long lived assets for impairment 
the recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparing the asset s carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we currently operate in one business segment  the biopharmaceutical development and commercialization segment 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  sfas no 
requires that we assess whether goodwill should be allocated to operating levels lower than our single operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed for decision making purposes 
these lower levels are referred to as reporting units 
currently  we have identified two reporting units  the orapred business and our other development and commercialization activities  which are components of our single operating segment 
we perform an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by assessing the fair value and recoverability of our goodwill  unless facts and circumstances warrant a review of goodwill for impairment before that time 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
the recoverability of the carrying value of leasehold improvements for our administrative facilities will depend on the successful execution of our business initiatives and our ability to earn sufficient returns on our approved products and product candidates 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
product sales transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders  invoices and the related shipping documents 
the timing of customer purchases and the resulting product shipments has a significant impact on the amount of revenue from product sales that we recognize in a particular period 
also  the majority of orapred sales are made to wholesalers  which  in turn resell the product to retail outlets 
inventory in the distribution channel consists of inventory held by wholesalers  who are our principal customers  and inventory held by retailers 
our revenue from product sales in a particular period is impacted by increases or decreases in wholesalers inventory levels 
from time to time  we offer sales incentives  such as price discounts and extended payment terms  in the ordinary course of business 
these incentives may impact the level of inventory held by wholesalers 
if wholesaler inventories substantially exceed retail demand  we could experience reduced revenue from sales in subsequent periods  or product returns from the distribution channel due to overstocking  low end user demand or product expiration 
we establish and maintain reserves for amounts payable to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs for the reimbursement of a portion of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective plans 
the amounts estimated to be paid relating to products sold are recognized as revenue reductions and as additions to accrued expenses at the time of the original sale 
the rebate reserves are based on our best 
table of contents estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to these managed care organizations and state medicaid patients  as well as the rebate rates associated with eligible prescriptions 
the estimates are developed using the product s rebate history adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these factors include changes in the mix of prescriptions that are eligible for rebates  changes in the contract rebate rates and the lag time related to the processing of rebate claims by our customers 
the length of time between the period of original sale and the processing of the related rebates has been consistent historically at between three and six months  depending on the nature of the rebate and distribution channel inventory levels 
neither the rebate rates nor the time to process rebates are extremely sensitive to changes because both the rebate rate structures and the related rebate processing practices of our customers are well established 
to the extent actual rebates differ from management s estimates  additional reserves may be required 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
these revenue reductions are established by our management as our best estimate at the time of the original sale based on the product s historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance or as an addition to accrued expenses 
we generally permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned near or after expiration 
our estimates for future product returns are primarily based on the actual return history for the product 
our estimates for future product returns are also based on the amount of inventory that exists in the distribution channel 
although we are unable to quantify wholesaler inventory levels with any certainty  to the extent necessary based on the expiration date and quantity of product in the distribution channel  we adjust our estimate for future returns as appropriate 
we estimate wholesaler inventory levels  to the extent possible  based on limited information obtained from certain of our wholesale customers and through other internal analysis 
our internal analysis utilizes information such as historical sales to wholesalers  product shelf life based on expiration dating  estimates of the length of time product is in the distribution channel and historical prescription data  which is provided by a third party vendor 
we also evaluate the current and future commercial market for orapred and consider factors such as orapred s performance compared to its existing competitors 
the amount of orapred returns compared to sales has been reasonably consistent historically 
our experience is that the length of time between the period of original sale and the product return is between one and two years 
because the product has been on the market for slightly more than three years and the product expiration dating is two to three years  we are continuing to obtain and analyze the returns history 
our evaluation of such factors has not resulted in material revisions to our estimates of future product returns for our current sales 
however  to the extent actual chargebacks and product returns differ from management s estimates  additional reserves may be required 
additionally  in the ascent pediatrics transaction we acquired liabilities for certain orapred product returns and unclaimed rebates for the period prior to our acquisition of the product 
we may need to adjust our estimates of these liabilities in the future 
as discussed above  our estimates of revenue dilution items are based primarily on the historical experience for the product  as adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact the revenue dilutions 
the nature and amount of our current estimates of the applicable revenue dilution item that are applied to gross sales to derive net sales are described in the table below 
the rebate allowance rates disclosed below reflect an increase in late to our expected future rebates based on increased managed care organization and medicaid rebate rates being implemented in response to the recently approved aa rated generic 
prior to the introduction of the new generic competitor of orapred  our estimated provision for rebates as a percentage of gross sales was 
we expect that our rebate rates will continue to increase in the future 
there are no additional material revenue dilution items other than those disclosed below and there have been no material revisions to our estimates of our revenue dilution items to date  except as discussed above 

table of contents revenue dilution item estimated rate description cash discounts discounts offered to customers for prompt payment of accounts receivable sales returns provision for returns of product sales  mostly due to product expiration or damage rebates rebates offered to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs total we periodically evaluate the need to maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when making this evaluation  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and the aging profile of customer accounts receivable and assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  the orapred product has not experienced significant credit losses and an allowance for doubtful accounts has not been required because a significant portion of orapred sales is made to a limited number of financially viable distributors  because we offer discounts that encourage the prompt payment of outstanding receivables and because we require immediate payment in certain circumstances 
however  since we cannot predict changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that allowances will not be required in the future 
if we begin to experience credit losses  our operating expenses would increase 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  the principal amount of which is the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards  of approximately million at december  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
this critical accounting assumption has been historically accurate  as we have not been able to utilize our net deferred tax assets  and we do not expect changes to this assumption as we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or fair value 
we determine the cost of raw materials using the average cost method and the cost of finished goods using the specific identification cost method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management 
a critical estimate in this determination is the estimate of the future expected inventory requirements  whereby we compare our internal sales forecasts to inventory on hand 
actual results may differ from those estimates and inventory write offs may be required 
research and development research and development expenses include expenses associated with contract research and development provided by third parties  product manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  clinical and regulatory costs  and internal research and development costs 
a critical accounting assumption by management is that we believe that 
table of contents regulatory approval of our product candidates is uncertain  and do not assume that product manufactured prior to regulatory approval will be sold commercially 
as a result  inventory costs for product candidates are expensed as research and development expenses until regulatory approval is obtained  at which time inventory is capitalized at the lower of cost or fair value 
historically  there have been no changes to this assumption 
stock option plans we have three stock based compensation plans 
we account for those plans under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees whereby generally no stock based compensation cost is reflected in our net loss for options issued to employees and directors with exercise prices at or above the market price on the date of issuance 
we recognize as an expense the fair value of options granted to persons who are neither employees nor directors 
the fair value of options granted is determined using the black scholes model  which requires various estimates and assumptions by management  including the expected term of the options and the expected future volatility of the value of our stock 
the expected term of stock options is determined primarily based on the historical patterns for stock option exercises and cancellations 
the expected future volatility is determined based on both the historical volatility as well as current and future circumstances that will affect future volatility 
these estimates are sensitive to change based on external factors such as the equity markets in general and the individual circumstances of our employees  which are considered in the determination of our estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note q of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and management s expectation of their impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations all of the activities related to the manufacture  distribution and sale of aldurazyme are reported in the results of the joint venture 
because of this presentation and the significance of the joint venture s operations compared to our total operations  we have divided our discussion of the results of operations into two sections  biomarin in total and biomarin genzyme llc 
the discussion of the joint venture s operations includes the total amounts for the joint venture  not just our interest in the operations 
biomarin results of operations net loss our net loss in as compared to increased to million from million 
net loss for increased as a result of the following in millions expenses associated with ascent pediatrics acquisition includes million of in process research and development expense impairment of acquired intangible assets decrease in equity in loss of joint venture due to increased aldurazyme sales lack of non recurring milestone revenue orapred operating profit separation costs associated with former ceo absence of reversal of lease liability net decrease in other operating expenses increased interest expense due to convertible debt issued in june other total increase in net loss 
table of contents expenses associated with the ascent pediatrics acquisition include acquired in process research and development of million  amortization of acquired intangible assets of million  imputed interest expense of million and a fair value inventory adjustment of million 
the net decrease in other operating expenses is the result of decreased research and development expense  primarily attributable to the lack of neutralase development costs  offset by increased rhasb and phenoptin research and development expenses and corporate overhead 
our net loss in as compared to decreased to million from million 
the decrease was primarily the result of a one time  million milestone payment received from genzyme in and the lack of an million in process research and development expense in related to the acquisition of synapse technologies inc without these items  our net loss would have increased by million in as a result of an increase in research and development expenses in of million 
the increase in research and development expense in primarily related to rhasb and neutralase  for which research and development expense increased by million and million  respectively  in compared to revenue and gross profit commencing with our acquisition of the ascent pediatrics business on may   our revenues include sales of orapred  a patent protected drug primarily used to treat asthma exacerbations in children 
during  we recognized million of net product sales of orapred and approximately million of gross profit  representing a gross margin of approximately 
cost of sales of million includes a million charge related to an inventory fair market value adjustment associated with the acquisition and a million charge for excess orapred raw materials 
gross margin for excluding these items was 
cost of sales excludes the amortization of the developed product technology resulting from the acquisition of the ascent pediatrics business 
net sales of orapred during were lower than expected as a result of larger than anticipated levels of orapred inventory held by distributors prior to our acquisition of the product 
during the fourth quarter of  the level of inventory in the distribution channel began to normalize and we recognized million of net product sales 
additionally  a new generic competitor to orapred was introduced into the market in the fourth quarter of  which has adversely affected the net product sales of orapred 
although we are implementing defensive strategies  we expect the adverse impact on net product sales to continue in the future 
milestone revenue in represents the million milestone payment received from genzyme related to the fda marketing approval of aldurazyme 
milestone revenue is typically not recurring in nature and we do not expect to earn additional milestone revenue related to aldurazyme in the future 
research and development expense our research and development expenses include personnel  facility and external costs associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and products 
these development costs primarily include preclinical and clinical studies  manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  quality control and assurance and other product development expenses such as regulatory costs 
research and development expenses decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to million of neutralase development costs incurred during that were not incurred during  because the program was discontinued  and decreased research and decreased development on other programs totaling million 
the decrease was offset by increased rhasb costs of million  increased phenoptin costs of million and research and development costs associated with the new orapred formulations of million 
the increased rhasb costs include million of increased manufacturing and quality costs  million of increased clinical costs primarily related to the phase clinical trial and million of regulatory costs associated with the filings of the marketing authorization applications 

table of contents the increased phenoptin costs primarily include million of manufacturing costs and million of clinical development costs 
research and development expenses in increased by million to million from million in the major factors causing the increase include increased rhasb activities including manufacturing and quality control costs of million and phase clinical trial costs of million 
increased neutralase phase clinical trial costs of million and contract manufacturing costs of million in also contributed to the increase 
selling  general and administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and administrative personnel  facility and external costs required to support our commercialized products and product development programs 
these selling  general and administrative costs include facility operating expenses and depreciation  sales operations in support of orapred and our product candidates  human resources  finance and support personnel expenses  and other corporate costs such as insurance  audit and legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in the components of the increase between and are as follows in millions orapred sales and marketing separation costs associated with former ceo absence of reversal of lease liability in preparation for commercial launch of rhasb net increase in corporate overhead and other total increase the net increase in corporate overhead and other costs includes increased rent expense  audit fees and administrative personnel 
during  we recorded a deferred rent liability related to our occupied facilities  of which the portions attributable to prior periods were immaterial 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the components of the decrease between and are as follows in millions absence of facility abandonment costs absence of costs related to the glyko biomedical ltd 
acquisition reversal of lease liability increased technical and administrative consulting increased personnel costs increased insurance costs net increase in corporate overhead and other administrative costs total variance included in the facility abandonment costs during are the asset write offs and lease commitment accrual related to the abandonment of a facility 
the related lease liability was reversed in in conjunction with our decision to develop the previously abandoned facility 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets includes the current amortization expense of the intangible assets acquired in the ascent pediatrics transaction in may  including the orapred developed and core technology 

table of contents the acquired intangible assets are being amortized over years and we expect that the recurring annual amortization expense associated with the transaction will be approximately million 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development includes the nonrecurring charge for the portion of acquisition consideration attributable to development stage products 
acquired in process research and development of million during includes the fair value of the two additional development stage formulations of orapred that we acquired in the ascent pediatrics transaction 
acquired in process research and development expense of million in represents the purchase price of all of the outstanding stock of synapse technologies  inc in march  plus related expenses 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s loss for the period 
equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc was million in compared to million in the decrease is principally due to the profits derived from million of aldurazyme sales in compared to million of sales during equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc was million in compared to million in the decrease was principally due to aldurazyme sales and the capitalization of inventory production costs upon the regulatory approval of aldurazyme during the second quarter of  partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs associated with the commercialization of aldurazyme 
see the biomarin genzyme llc section below for further discussion of the joint venture s results of operations 
impairment of acquired intangible assets impairment of acquired intangible assets during the year ended december  includes the impairment loss recorded on the orapred product technology during the fourth quarter of in december  the company recognized an impairment loss totaling million 
the primary circumstance leading to the impairment was the introduction of a new generic competitor to orapred during the fourth quarter of that resulted in a significant decrease in the orapred market share 
the impairment charge represents the amount by which the carrying value of the orapred technology exceeded its fair value on december  interest income we invest our cash  short term investments and restricted cash in government and other high credit quality securities in order to limit default and market risk 
interest income decreased to million in from million in interest income increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased levels of cash and investments obtained through the common stock and convertible debt offerings completed during interest expense we incur interest expense on our convertible debt issued in june and on our equipment and facility loans 
interest expense also includes imputed interest expense on the discounted obligation for the ascent pediatrics transaction 
interest expense was million and million in and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase in primarily represents interest expense related to the convertible debt issued in june of million and imputed interest related to the ascent pediatrics transaction of million 

table of contents interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was due to six months of interest expense on the convertible debt 
discontinued operations in december  we decided to close the carbohydrate analytical business portion of our wholly owned subsidiary  glyko  inc glyko 
as a result  the operations of glyko are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we have segregated its operating results in our consolidated statements of operations and have segregated its cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in  we sold certain assets of glyko to a third party for a total sales price of up to million 
the sales price was comprised of cash totaling million  a note receivable payable in quarterly installments through totaling million and quarterly royalties based upon future sales of certain glyko products through up to a maximum of million 
the proceeds from the sale of the glyko assets  including the discounted note receivable of million  was recorded as a gain from discontinued operations in totaling million  net of transaction costs  as the net book value of the glyko net assets was reduced to zero as of december  the royalties are recorded as earned 
income from discontinued operations in represents net receipts from glyko subsequent to our decision to discontinue this business 
the loss from disposal of discontinued operations in of million represents the glyko closure expense subsequent to our decision to discontinue this business 
biomarin genzyme llc results of operations the discussion below gives effect to the inventory capitalization policy that we use for inventory held by the joint venture  which is different from the joint venture s inventory capitalization policy 
we began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in may  after us regulatory approval was obtained 
the joint venture began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in january  when inventory production for commercial sale began 
the difference in inventory capitalization policies results in a greater operating expense realized by us prior to regulatory approval  and lower cost of goods sold with higher gross profit realized by us as the previously expensed product is sold by the joint venture  as well as lower research and development expense when aldurazyme is used in on going clinical trials 
these differences will be eliminated when all of the product manufactured prior to regulatory approval has been sold or has been used in clinical trials 
we estimate that the majority of the differences will be eliminated by the end of see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the difference in inventory cost basis between the joint venture and us 
revenue and gross profit our joint venture partner  genzyme and we received marketing approval for aldurazyme in the us in april  and in the us in june we have subsequently received marketing approval in other countries 
aldurazyme was launched commercially in may in the us and in june in the us the joint venture recognized million and million of net revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue from to of million is attributable to both an increase in the number of patients initiating therapy and a full year of revenue during there were and commercial patients on therapy at the end of and  respectively 
gross profit was million and million for and  respectively 
gross profit for would have been higher by million if not for production costs incurred during the third quarter of that were not allocated to aldurazyme inventory 
without the effect of this charge in  aldurazyme gross margins were approximately and for and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin  excluding the charge  is attributable to the recognition of higher cost of sales in compared to as the joint venture sells the inventory that was produced after obtaining regulatory approval  which has a higher cost basis because the inventory produced prior to obtaining regulatory approval was previously expensed 

table of contents biomarin genzyme llc recognized million of net revenue during  representing pre approval sales on a named patient basis allowable in certain countries outside of the us operating expenses operating expenses of the joint venture include the costs associated with the development and commercial support of aldurazyme and totaled million for as compared to million for operating expenses in included million of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the commercial support of aldurazyme and million of research and development costs  primarily clinical trial costs 
operating expenses in included million of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the commercial launch of aldurazyme and million of research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in due to increased post launch commercialization activities 
research and development of the joint venture for included million for the production of aldurazyme prior to obtaining regulatory approval and million of clinical trial costs and continued research and development efforts 
operating expenses in included million of selling  general and administrative expenses related to the commercialization of aldurazyme and million of research and development 
research and development decreased in compared to due to the capitalization of inventory in may after regulatory approval was obtained 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in due to increased commercialization activities in support of the aldurazyme commercial launch 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow we have financed our operations by the issuance of common stock  convertible debt  equipment and other commercial financing and the related interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during  we received million of proceeds from our equipment and facility loan 
during  we raised million from a public offering of our common stock  million from the sale of our common stock to acqua wellington and million from a convertible debt offering 
we voluntarily elected to terminate our equity financing agreement with acqua wellington in september as of december   our combined cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt totaled million  a decrease of million from million at december  the restricted cash of million at december   is primarily associated with the ascent pediatrics transaction and we expect the restrictions to be released in the second quarter of cash balances related to long term debt represent an amount totaling million that we are required to keep on deposit with comerica bank pursuant to the terms of the equipment and facility loan that we entered into in may this amount is equal to the long term portion of the outstanding balance under this facility 
the maintenance of a deposit equal to the outstanding amount under the facility is a covenant of the facility and the failure to satisfy this covenant would constitute a breach under the facility 
however  we have the ability to access the amount at our discretion and therefore it is not restricted cash 
cash inflows during included proceeds from our equipment and facility loan from comerica totaling million 
the primary sources of cash during were the financing activities described above  a milestone payment from genzyme of million and the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options under our stock compensation plans of approximately million 
pursuant to our settlement of the dispute with medicis in january  medicis will make available to us a convertible note of up to million beginning july  based on certain terms and conditions and 
table of contents provided that the company does not experience a change of control 
money advanced under the convertible note is convertible into our common stock according to the terms of the convertible note 
we anticipate drawing funds from this note when it becomes available 
the primary uses of cash during were to finance operations  which primarily included the manufacturing and clinical trials of rhasb and the related supporting functions  the ascent pediatrics transaction and the manufacturing and clinical development of phenoptin 
our cash burn  a non gaap financial measure  in was million as compared to million in the million increase in cash burn during is primarily attributable to cash payments associated with the ascent pediatrics transaction totaling million  an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the development of our facilities of million  and the lack of the million milestone revenue received in these increases in cash burn were partially offset by equipment and facility loan proceeds of million and several other net reductions in cash burn  including net orapred operating cash inflow  a decrease in the cash investment in the joint venture and other working capital changes 
see overview non gaap financial measures above for a discussion of cash burn as a non gaap financial measure and the reconciliation of cash burn to net increase decrease in cash 
we do not expect to generate net positive cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future because we expect to continue to incur operational expenses and continue our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  process development  including quality systems for product manufacture  regulatory processes in the us and international jurisdictions  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  and expansion of sales and marketing activities  including the support of the ascent pediatrics business 
we also expect to incur costs through our joint venture related to increased marketing and manufacturing of aldurazyme to satisfy the product demands associated with its commercialization 
as a result of the ascent pediatrics transaction and the january amendments to the transaction agreements  we expect to pay medicis million in specified cash payments through  of which million is payable in funding commitments we expect to fund our operations with our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and currently restricted cash  supplemented by proceeds from equity or debt financings  loans or collaborative agreements with corporate partners 
we expect our current cash  short term investments  currently restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt and funds contractually committed to us will meet our operating and capital requirements into the first quarter of 
table of contents our investment in our product development programs has a major impact on our operating performance 
our research and development expenses for the years  and  and for the period since inception march represent the following in millions since program inception rhasb phenoptin orapred vibrilase neurotrans neutralase not allocated to specific major projects we cannot estimate the cost to complete any of our product development programs 
additionally  except as disclosed under overview of item  we cannot estimate the time to complete any of our product development programs or when we expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our product development programs 
please see factors that may affect future results for a discussion of the reasons that we are unable to estimate such information  and in particular if we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval to commercially manufacture or sell our drugs and future drug products  or if approval is delayed  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished  and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased  to obtain regulatory approval to market our products  preclinical studies and costly and lengthy clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain  if we are unable to successfully develop manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program  if we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected  and if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
we expect that the proceeds from equity or debt financing  loans or collaborative agreements will be used to fund future operating costs  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which may include costs associated with the commercialization of our products  additional clinical trials and the manufacturing of orapred  rhasb and phenoptin  preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates  potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies  general corporate purposes  payment of the amounts due to the ascent pediatrics transaction  and working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to successfully market and sell orapred  our joint venture partner s ability to successfully commercialize aldurazyme  the progress  timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments

as a result of the ascent pediatrics transaction  we expect to pay medicis million in specified cash payments through  of which million is payable in we anticipate a need for additional financing to fund our future operations  including the commercialization of our drug product candidates currently under development 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be obtained or  if obtained  will be available on reasonable terms or in a timely manner

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and  therefore  our investment portfolio is not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at december   we believe that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately million  respectively  in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  however  we will not recognize such gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations unless the investments are sold 
the table below presents the carrying value of our cash and investment portfolio  which approximates fair value at december  in thousands carrying value cash and cash equivalents short term investments total 
table of contents of cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds and of uninvested cash 
of short term investments invested in us agency securities  and in corporate bonds 
our debt obligations consist of our convertible debt and our equipment and facility loans 
our convertible debt carries a fixed interest rate and  as a result  we are not exposed to interest rate market risk on our convertible debt 
the interest rates for certain of our equipment and facility loans are based on the london inter bank offer rate libor and we are therefore exposed to fluctuations in the libor market 
the outstanding principal balance on our equipment and facility loans that carry libor based rates was million as of december  the carrying value of our convertible debt and equipment loans approximates their fair value at december  foreign currency exchange rate market risk a significant portion of aldurazyme sales by biomarin genzyme llc are earned outside of the us and  therefore  our equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc is subject to risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the policies and procedures related to the management of foreign currency risk of aldurazyme sales are maintained and performed by our joint venture partner  genzyme 
based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   we do not expect that a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year
