the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops new drugs and improved formulations of existing drugs using our proprietary porous microparticle technology 
we are focused on developing proprietary drugs that can offer significant benefits such as improved safety and efficacy  increased patient compliance  greater ease of use  expanded indications or reduced cost 
our three initial product candidates are designed to address large unmet clinical needs within cardiology  oncology and asthma 
our lead product candidate is a cardiovascular drug in phase clinical development for the detection of coronary heart disease  the leading cause of death in the united states 
we created our initial product candidates using technology that enables us to control the size and porosity of particles in a versatile manner  so we can customize the particles to address the delivery needs of a variety of drugs 
we are focused on creating porous microparticles that are smaller than red blood cells 
some of these microparticles are nanoparticles which are smaller than micron 
small microparticles are important for delivering drugs intravenously so that they can pass through the body s smallest blood vessels  for increasing the surface area of a drug so that the drug will dissolve more rapidly  and for delivering drugs to the lung via inhalation 
porosity is important for entrapping gases in microparticles  for controlling the release rate of the drug from a microparticle  and for targeting inhaled drugs to specific regions of the lung 
we have incurred significant operating losses to develop our product candidates and we anticipate continuing to incur significant operating losses in the coming years 
in particular  we expect to incur significant additional expenses and experience other significant capital requirements for the conduct of our phase clinical program for ai and to complete the build out and qualification of a manufacturing facility for the initial commercial manufacture of ai since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities  equipment backed financings and other debt financings 
ai clinical trial update the phase clinical plan provides for a two part program consisting of a pilot phase the pilot study  under which new investigators and blinded readers have been qualified and trained  and two multi center pivotal trials the and trials  each seeking to enroll approximately patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease 
the phase pivotal studies are currently taking place at clinical sites located in north america  europe and australia with data from the trials intended for submission to us  european and potentially other regulatory authorities 
as of march  over patients have been enrolled in the phase pivotal trials and over patients have been enrolled in the phase program  including the pivotal trials and the pilot study 
we currently anticipate completing cumulative enrollment of at least patients in the pivotal trials during the second half of the pilot study 
our objectives in the pilot study were to train and qualify a sufficient number of clinical sites  investigators and blinded readers for transition into one of the two pivotal trials 
these objectives have been accomplished 
clinical sites trained in the pilot study transitioned into a pivotal trial when  in our judgment  the clinical site demonstrated that it is prepared to meet the requirements of the clinical trial protocol which  in the pivotal trial requiring nuclear stress tests in all patients  includes conducting both stress echo and stress nuclear studies on the same patient on the same day 
because the pilot study has been conducted for training purposes  there are no defined clinical efficacy endpoints in this study 
the pivotal trials 
more than twenty clinical sites are participating in the pivotal trials  and both trials are active in enrolling patients 
as part of the phase pivotal study design  the evaluation of the stress echo and nuclear stress images from the pivotal trials is performed by panels of blinded readers who receive no information about the patient being evaluated other than the images 
the primary efficacy endpoints relative to nuclear stress tests and angiography are set at thresholds that are the same or lower than those already achieved in our phase trial results 
safety will continue to be tested and evaluated during our pivotal trials 
the trial 
all of the patients enrolled in this trial will receive a stress echo study with ai and a nuclear stress test 
patients in this pivotal trial will undergo coronary angiography only if they have a positive nuclear stress test result 
patients in this pivotal trial who have a negative nuclear stress test result will be evaluated for ninety days thereafter for cardiac events 
the primary endpoints for this pivotal trial are sensitivity and specificity in comparison to nuclear stress testing  angiography or clinical outcome 
the trial 
all of the patients enrolled in this trial will receive a stress echo study with ai and will undergo coronary angiography 
the majority of patients  but not all  will receive a nuclear stress test 
the primary endpoints for this pivotal trial are sensitivity and specificity in comparison to angiography 
although we are targeting these clinical endpoints and timing for clinical enrollment in our phase trials  we cannot assure you that we will successfully achieve results that meet or exceed these clinical endpoints or that enrollment will be completed in european collaboration agreement in july  we entered into a collaboration  license and supply agreement with nycomed pursuant to which we granted nycomed rights to develop and market ai in europe 
as part of the agreement  nycomed has agreed to provide up to million in license fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments  including million in payments over the first two years 
these near term payments include million in upfront license fees and million in research and development funding payable in eight equal quarterly installments 
the remaining million in milestone payments are related to regulatory approvals and achievement of certain sales goals 
in addition  nycomed has agreed to pay us to manufacture ai for them and to pay us royalties on nycomed s sales of ai nycomed will be responsible for sales  marketing and the regulatory submissions required for marketing throughout its sales territory  which includes the member states of the european union  as well as russia cis and turkey 
during the fiscal year ended december   we began to recognize revenues derived from our collaboration with nycomed 
the nycomed agreement is subject to termination provisions 
under certain of these termination provisions  if the company fails in any material respect to use all commercially reasonable efforts to carry out referenced obligations under the agreement  we would be obligated to pay nycomed liquidated damages of up to million 
we plan to carry out all of these obligations  which we believe are in our control 
there can be no assurance that termination of this agreement will not occur or that such termination would not result in the company incurring liquidated damages of up to million 
financial operations overview revenue 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception 
in connection with our collaboration agreement with nycomed  we expect to receive million in license fees and research and development payments from july through june further in the future  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  up front or milestone payments and manufacturing payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the license of our products and intellectual property 
upon commencement of our collaboration agreement with nycomed  we emerged from development stage for accounting purposes 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in developing  manufacturing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  costs of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection on select elements of our intellectual property 
we expense research and development costs  including patent related costs  as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
development programs for later stage product candidates  such as ai  tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length and the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials for later stage programs and due to costs of scaling production to commercial scale 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results principally from stock option grants to our employees at exercise prices deemed for accounting purposes to be below the fair market value of our stock on the date the stock options were granted fixed awards 
prior to our initial public offering  which closed on october   we granted certain stock options for which the exercise prices were deemed for accounting purposes to be below the fair value of the underlying common stock resulting in our recording stock based compensation expense associated with such grants 
stock based compensation expense is also recorded for stock option grants to non employees and for restricted stock grants provided to directors and advisors in lieu of cash compensation 
deferred compensation for accounting purposes on fixed awards is amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting periods of the options and grants  subject to adjustment for forfeiture during the vesting period 
equity in loss of joint venture 
in june  we established in collaboration with elan corporation  plc and its affiliates elan a joint venture  acusphere newco  ltd  a bermuda corporation  to develop and commercialize pulmonary drug delivery product candidates 
in september  we reached an agreement with elan terminating the joint venture in a cash free transaction 
equity in loss of joint venture consists of our portion of the losses from acusphere newco  ltd 
from june  when the joint venture was established  until september  when the joint venture was terminated 
in connection with the termination of the joint venture we recorded a loss of  for an amount previously recorded as due from elan 
interest and other income expense 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  and cash equivalents 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on equipment leases and on debt financings 
accretion of dividends and offering costs on convertible preferred stock 
accretion of dividends and offering costs on convertible preferred stock primarily consists of dividends on convertible preferred stock 
prior to conversion of convertible preferred stock to common stock  which occurred on october  upon the completion of our initial public offering  our convertible preferred stock was entitled to accretion of dividends  the amount of which decreased the amount of stockholders equity available to common stockholders and effectively increases the loss per share of common stock 
after october   no existing convertible preferred stock is outstanding  and accordingly there will be no further accretion of dividends and offering costs on these shares 
all preferred stock dividends which were accreted before october  were forfeited by the preferred stockholders on that date in connection with the conversion of these preferred shares to common stock 
results of operations revenue 
collaboration revenue was million in the year ended december  compared to no collaboration revenue recognized in and collaboration revenue was earned under our agreement with nycomed which was entered into in july under this agreement  excluding any payments that we might receive based upon the achievement of specified milestones  we are scheduled to receive million in license fees and research and development payments through june  of which million was received through december  we are recognizing revenue associated with these payments ratably over a period of forty two months  representing the estimated development period over which such fees are earned 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the million increase in over represented an increase of and the million increase in over represented an increase of 
in compared to  the higher research and development expense primarily resulted from increased activities in the ai phase clinical program  including clinical site costs  data management costs  independent clinical monitoring costs and costs of manufacturing clinical materials 
the increase in research and development costs also includes costs associated with increasing full and part time personnel 
in compared to  the higher research and development expense primarily resulted from costs associated with the start of our phase clinical program for ai  including increased costs associated with clinical site training and clinical site monitoring 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expense for the years ended december   and because of our ability to utilize resources across several projects  many of our research and development costs are not tied to any individual project and are allocated among multiple projects 
we record direct costs on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs in aggregate in support of all research and development 
years ended december  in thousands ai    ai and ai  other    total direct costs    facility costs    depreciation    patent costs total research and development expense    research and development costs generally increase as programs progress from early stage clinical trials to late stage clinical trials 
our primary research and development programs are as follows late stage clinical development program ai 
our lead product candidate  ai  is a cardiovascular drug for the detection of coronary heart disease 
we incurred direct research and development expense for ai in of million  million in and million in of these amounts  million in  million in  and million in were incurred in connection with the production of clinical trial material by a third party contract manufacturer 
in  we commenced clinical studies in our phase clinical program for ai  and we identified and began training additional clinical sites to be part of this phase clinical program 
in  the number of clinical sites actively enrolling patients in this phase clinical program increased as did the rate of patient enrollment in the program 
patient enrollment is anticipated to continue to increase during until the pivotal phase clinical trials are completed 
as increasing numbers of patients are enrolled in the phase clinical program  we anticipate incurring increased costs from professional service firms helping to support the clinical trial by providing services such as independent clinical monitoring  data acquisition and data evaluation 
we also anticipate incurring increased costs related to hiring of additional research and development personnel 
in addition  we anticipate incurring increased costs associated with preparation for commercial production  including the build out of our new commercial manufacturing space 
early stage clinical development programs ai and ai 
our initial clinical applications of our hdds technology  ai  and our pdds technology  ai  have completed a phase trial 
we incurred direct research and development expense for ai and ai in of   in and million in of these amounts   in was incurred in connection with the production of clinical trial material by a third party contract manufacturer 
there were no contract manufacturing costs incurred in connection with these product development programs in or we anticipate that our costs associated with these clinical programs will not increase significantly until we are prepared to commence further pre clinical and clinical testing using our own resources or through strategic collaborations 
other 
other direct research and development costs primarily consist of management and preclinical evaluation of other product candidates 
each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals  which are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research and development programs  particularly our early stage programs  must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
failure to commercialize these product candidates on a timely basis could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may seek to establish collaborative relationships to help us commercialize these product candidates  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for and million for the million increase in over represented an increase of while the  increase in over represented an increase of 
in compared to  the increase in general and administrative expense was principally due to the various costs of being a public company  including costs associated with investor relations  legal counsel  auditing and additional personnel 
also contributing to the higher expenses are increased activities in business development and marketing  including market research expenses 
in compared to  the increase in general and administrative expense primarily resulted from hiring experienced personnel in both the finance and business development areas 
this increase also includes legal and other support costs associated with operating as a public company 
we anticipate some overall increase in general and administrative expense  including increases in costs for investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
these increases will also likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
we intend to continue to incur various internal and external business development costs to support our various product development efforts  and certain of these expenses are likely to increase overall 
however  until we are closer to substantially completing enrollment of the majority of patients required in the ai phase clinical program  we do not anticipate incurring significantly increased costs to accelerate preparations for the commercial introduction of ai stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the  decrease in over represented a decrease of  and the  decrease in over represented a decrease of 
stock based compensation expense incurred in both years resulted principally from the vesting of stock options granted in prior periods on which deferred compensation had previously been recorded and decreased as a result of certain prior year awards becoming fully vested in the current period 
equity in loss of joint venture 
our joint venture with elan was terminated in september during the year ended december   we recognized a million loss from our equity share in the loss of the elan joint venture 
this amount related to research and development of pulmonary drug delivery product candidates and from the expense of an amount previously recorded as due from elan 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense for the year ended december  was  of net income  compared to million of net expense in and million of net expense in the million increase in net income in over represented an increase of and the million increase in net expense in over represented an increase of 
during these years  interest and other income expense consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands interest income other income interest expense   total  net   the increase in interest income in compared to was primarily due to higher average fund balances available for investment resulting from funds received from the initial public offering in october and the million private placement completed in october the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to interest costs associated with bridge loans of million  interest paid on the subordinated loans payable of  and amortization of the discount of  in compared to zero in the subordinated loans were paid off in june of and the bridge loans converted into common stock upon completion of the company s initial public offering on october  in addition to this  the interest expense on the lower capital lease balances has decreased  in compared to the decrease in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to reduced yields on investments 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to  of costs incurred from the amortization of the discount recorded for accounting purposes on the warrants issued in connection with the convertible promissory notes in april and june and to  of interest accrued on the convertible promissory notes  partially offset by a decrease of  in interest paid on the subordinated loans payable and the decrease of  in amortization of the warrants issued in connection with the subordinated loans payable  due to the early repayment in of these subordinated loans payable 
accretion of dividends and offering costs on convertible preferred stock 
accretion of dividends and offering costs on convertible preferred stock was zero in  million in and million in the  decrease in over represented a decrease of 
in compared to  the decrease in accretion of dividends and offering costs resulted primarily from the conversion of convertible preferred stock into common stock in conjunction with the company s initial public offering in october after october  and through december   no convertible preferred stock remained outstanding and  accordingly  there was no further accretion of dividends and offering costs on these shares in after that date 
in connection with the conversion of preferred stock to common stock  all previously accreted dividends on the convertible preferred stock were forfeited by the holders 
liquidity and capital resources historically  aside from payments received in connection with our strategic collaboration with nycomed  we have financed our business through the issuance of equity securities  debt financings and equipment leases 
our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from research and development expenditures  equipment expenditures and payments on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
as of december  we owed  from capital leases  million from notes payable and had commitments totaling million for rent under our facility leases  including the lease agreement signed in july for commercial manufacturing space in tewksbury  massachusetts 
during the year ended december   operating activities used million of cash 
net cash used by operating activities during this period resulted primarily from a net loss of million 
this use of cash was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and non cash charges for stock based compensation expense of million 
in  because we estimate a higher rate of patient enrollment in our phase clinical program than in  we anticipate that our operating spending will be higher in than in we estimate such spending during to be approximately to million per quarter 
during the year ended december   investing activities used million in cash 
this use of cash was primarily for purchases of equipment and costs incurred through december  for the build out and expansion of our manufacturing operations for ai during the year ended december   financing activities provided million in cash 
net cash provided by financing activities during this period resulted primarily from the net proceeds of our million private placement of our common stock  described below  of million  entering into promissory notes under the equipment financing line  described below  of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of  and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan of  these proceeds were partially offset by payments on the capital leases and promissory notes of  in april  we entered into an million equipment financing line with an equipment financing company 
borrowings under this equipment line were originally available for qualified purchases through march  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including an updated credit review  of the lender 
in august  the equipment financing line was increased to million  and in march  the financing line was extended through august  borrowings under the equipment financing line are secured by the qualified purchases and repaid over to months  depending on the nature of the equipment financed 
no warrants were granted in connection with this equipment line 
the million equipment line is structured as a loan agreement 
however  we may elect to borrow up to million of this amount in the form of a capital lease 
the interest rate on this facility varies depending upon whether the borrowing is in the form of a loan or lease and whether the term is months or months 
such interest rates are fixed at the time of each borrowing under the equipment line with such rates adjusted between borrowings based on the us federal reserve s three year and four year treasury constant maturity rates 
as of december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowings under this equipment line  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including an updated credit review  of the lender 
in july  we entered into a collaboration  license and supply agreement with nycomed in which the company granted nycomed rights to develop and market ai in europe 
as part of this agreement  in july nycomed paid to us a million license fee and the first of eight consecutive quarterly installments of million each 
in october and january  nycomed paid us the second and third quarterly installments of million each  respectively 
beginning in april  nycomed is required to pay us the remaining five consecutive quarterly installments of million each 
the agreement also provides for nycomed to pay to us up to million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones and sales goals 
under the agreement  nycomed has agreed to pay us to manufacture ai for them and to pay us royalties on nycomed s sales of ai in connection with this transaction  we are obligated to pay a customary fee to our financial advisor 
the fee is comprised of cash and warrants 
the total amount of cash payments is dependent upon the timing and magnitude of the amounts paid to us by nycomed 
in  we paid our advisor  in connection with this transaction 
on november   in connection with the nycomed transaction  we issued a warrant to our financial advisor to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in july  we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of commercial manufacturing space in tewksbury  massachusetts 
this lease has a five year  nine month term with options to extend the lease for up to two additional five year terms at predetermined rental rates 
initially  we will receive nine months of occupancy free of base rent  followed by base rent of approximately  for the next twelve months with scheduled annual rental rate increases thereafter 
in october  we paid an initial security deposit of million to the landlord as part of the lease  subject to reduction if we make certain tenant improvements and upon the installation of equipment in the facility 
in august  we entered into a million loan agreement with the massachusetts development finance agency  the economic development authority of the commonwealth of massachusetts  to help fund tenant improvements to the tewksbury facility 
financing is available under this loan agreement upon completion by us of certain tenant improvements to the tewksbury facility 
the term of this facility  if utilized  is expected to coincide with the term of the tewksbury lease 
as of december   no borrowings had been made under this loan agreement 
in july  we entered into definitive purchase agreements with institutional and accredited investors for a million private placement of up to  newly issued shares of common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in august  a partial closing of this private placement was consummated  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately million net proceeds of approximately million and the issuance of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock 
in october  we completed the second and final closing of the million private financing resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately million net proceeds of approximately million and the issuance of  shares of common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
all of the shares of common stock sold in the million private placement were registered under the securities act of  as amended  on a registration statement on form s that was declared effective by the sec on november  in february  we issued  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock resulting in aggregrate gross proceeds to us of million net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
in conjunction with this offering  we granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of preferred stock solely to cover over allotments  if any 
each share of preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share and is convertible into shares of our common stock  representing a conversion price of per share 
dividends will be cumulative from the date of original issue at the annual rate of per share of preferred stock  payable quarterly 
we may elect to automatically convert some or all of the preferred stock into shares of our common stock if the closing price of our common stock has exceed per share of the conversion price for at least trading days during any day trading period 
prior to march   if we elect to automatically convert  or if any holder elects to voluntarily convert  the preferred stock  we will also make an additional payment equal to the aggregate amount of dividends that would have been payable on the preferred stock so converted from the original date of issuance through and including march   less any dividends already paid on the preferred stock 
this additional payment is payable by us  at our option  in cash  in additional shares of our common stock or in a combination of both 
the preferred shares were sold under a shelf registration statement that was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on january  we believe  based on our operating plans  that our existing resources  including scheduled proceeds from nycomed and the proceeds from the february sale of preferred stock  will be adequate to fund our planned operations  including increases in spending for our ai phase clinical program  for at least the next twelve months and  based on our current operating plan  we believe these resources will be adequate to permit us to complete enrollment of patients in each of the ai pivotal phase clinical trials  to complete the day follow up period on the required subset of patients  and to publicly announce a summary of the results of these phase clinical trials 
we cannot assure you  however  that our clinical trials or other plans will proceed as anticipated  and therefore we cannot assure you that the net proceeds will actually be adequate to reach these milestones 
in addition  over the coming months and years we may require significant additional funds to develop  conduct clinical trials  achieve regulatory approvals  build out and qualify commercial manufacturing space and  subject to regulatory approval  commercially launch ai  our other product candidates under development and future product candidates 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities and our clinical trials and the size and timing of creating expanded manufacturing capabilities 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues  other than possible license or milestone payments  from commercial sale of our products unless or until we or current or potential partners complete clinical trials for our products and receive marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities 
when additional funds are required or when we anticipate that funds will be needed  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings or we may delay funding of certain development activities which could delay the completion of our ai clinical trials  the filing of our ai nda and the commercialization of ai which would have a materially adverse impact on our growth plans 
shelf registration statement on december   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
providing for the offer  from time to time  of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants up to an aggregate of million 
on january   the sec declared effective the shelf registration statement 
in february  we sold under the shelf registration statement  shares of our convertible exchangeable preferred stock  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
as of the filing of this annual report  the shelf registration statement remains effective and  subject to market conditions and our capital needs  we may again seek to use any remaining availability under the shelf registration statement by making an offering of securities covered for sale under the registration statement 
in addition  we may amend our shelf registration statement or file a new shelf registration statement to increase the company s potential access to capital 
if we elect to raise additional capital using a shelf registration statement  we may use the net proceeds from the sale of these securities for general corporate purposes  which may include funding clinical trials  research and development  regulatory activities and the build out of our commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts  acquisitions  including acquisitions of companies  products  intellectual property or other technology  repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness  investments  capital expenditures  repurchase of our capital stock and for any other purposes that we may specify in any prospectus supplement 
off balance sheet financing arrangements we currently do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total obligations all years through through through after in thousands capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations     notes payable including interest    purchase orders for capital equipment and leasehold improvements  total contractual cash obligations     our operating lease obligations relate to our facility leases 
as of december   we have entered into purchase orders for capital equipment and leasehold improvements which total approximately million 
against these purchase orders we have paid approximately million in deposits 
the table above reflects the remaining amounts due on these purchase orders 
in  we anticipate expenditures for equipment purchases totaling approximately million in excess of the above reflected amounts 
a substantial portion of the purchase orders for capital equipment and leasehold improvements in the table above is needed for expanded manufacturing of ai the company s efforts to build out a commercial manufacturing facility for ai are in the early construction phases 
on november   the company entered into an engineering and construction management services agreement with a contractor to perform on behalf of the company  engineering  design and construction management services in connection with the build out of the commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts 
the total estimated value of this cost plus percentage fee type contract  as amended on march   is million of which million is reflected in the total of million of purchase orders for capital equipment and leasehold improvements as of december  in  the company paid approximately million against this contract 
we expect that the build out of this commercial manufacturing facility will be substantially completed in and that our total payments in for this build out will be approximately million  excluding separately purchased equipment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
the year ended december  is the first year in which we recognized revenue 
we recognize revenue from license arrangements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and fasb emerging issue task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize revenue from license payments not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform services 
the period over which we are obligated to perform services is estimated based on available facts and circumstances 
we recognize revenue from performance payments  when such performance is substantially in our control and when we believe that completion of such performance is reasonably probable  ratably over the period over which we estimate that we will perform such performance obligations 
substantive at risk milestone payments  which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone when performance of such milestone is contingent on performance by others or for which achievement can not be reasonably estimated or assured  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due  provided that there is no substantial future service obligation associated with the milestone 
revenue in connection with license arrangements is recognized over the term of the arrangement and is limited to payments collected or due and reasonably assured of collection 
in circumstances where the arrangement includes a refund provision  we defer revenue recognition until the refund condition is no longer applicable unless  in our judgment  the refund circumstances are within our operating control and unlikely to occur 
payments received in advance of being recognized as revenue are deferred 
we are recognizing collaboration revenue of million associated with the initial license and performance based payments under the nycomed agreement based on an estimated recognition period of forty two months over which we are obligated to perform services supporting the agreement 
this estimated recognition period may change if available facts and circumstances change 
a change in this estimate could result in a significant change to the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
in addition  if the nycomed collaboration agreement is terminated for reasons other than certain non performance by us  we would recognize the remainder of the payments we have received or otherwise expect to collect over the amortization period at the time of termination 
we will not recognize revenue associated with the potential million in milestone based payments that may be earned under the nycomed agreement until the underlying regulatory and sales milestones are achieved 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  and contract service fees such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
stock based compensation and other equity instruments 
we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we have not recorded stock based compensation expense for stock options issued to employees in fixed amounts with exercise prices at least equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we account for transactions in which we grant warrants in connection with the issuance of debt in accordance with apb  accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
the two factors which most affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb no 
 apb no 
 sfas no 
and eitf no 
requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can be readily estimated  we use the value of such goods or services to determine the fair value of the equity instruments 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can not be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most stock options and warrants granted to employees or non employees  we estimated the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deemed to be relevant at the time using cost  market and or income approaches to such valuations 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded prior to our initial public offering in october  market factors historically considered in valuing stock and stock option grants include comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares we are issuing  pricing of private sales of our convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and the effect of events that have occurred between the time of such grants  economic trends  perspective provided by investment banks and the comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of december   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire through we also have research and development credit carryforwards of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the utilization of tax attributes including net operating loss carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year in the event of significant changes in ownership interest  as defined 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we expect to adopt sfas no 
r using the statement s modified prospective application method 
certain factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our company we have not generated any product revenue to date  and we may not achieve profitability for some time  if at all 
we are focused on product development and we have not generated any revenue from commercial sales of our products to date 
we have incurred losses each year of our operations and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next several years 
the process of developing our products requires significant clinical  development and laboratory testing and clinical trials as well as regulatory approvals 
in addition  commercialization of our product candidates will require us to establish sales  marketing and manufacturing capabilities  either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others 
we expect our research and development and general and administrative expenses will increase over the next several years 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development  and in particular our lead product candidate ai  we will not be able to generate revenues from the commercialization or sale of our product candidates 
we must receive regulatory approval of each of our product candidates before we can commercialize or sell that product candidate 
the pre clinical laboratory testing  formulation development  manufacturing and clinical trials of any product candidates we develop independently or in collaboration with third parties  as well as the distribution and marketing of these product candidates  are regulated by numerous federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  principally the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
the development and regulatory approval process takes many years  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  is uncertain and subject to delays  and will thus delay our receipt of revenues  if any  from any of our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that our clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates or will result in marketable products 
no product can receive fda approval unless human clinical trials show both safety and efficacy for each target indication in accordance with fda standards 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early stage development 
we therefore cannot assure you that the results from our phase clinical trials for ai will be predictive of results obtained in our phase clinical trials 
many of the patients in our ai clinical trial have coronary heart disease 
as part of our ai phase clinical trials  patients will be exposed to potential safety risks associated with a stress test  including risks associated with a pharmacological stressor  and ai given the nature of the ai phase clinical trial  including administering ai to larger numbers of at risk patients and new clinical sites  adverse events are expected to be encountered during the clinical trial 
adverse events are also likely to be encountered in clinical trials for our other products  which clinical trials also include at risk patients 
if significant adverse events are detected and these events are attributable to our products  such events could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approval 
further  data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approval 
we cannot assure you that our phase plan for ai will successfully address the concerns of the fda or that the results of the phase program will establish the safety and efficacy of ai sufficiently for us to obtain regulatory approval 
we may also encounter delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials 
we may also encounter delays  resulting from the need to enroll more patients than we currently plan for in our clinical trials  based on our inability to enroll a mix of patients that is consistent with our estimated clinical trial enrollment or a change in the sample size required to meet the study endpoints 
patient enrollment depends on many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  and the eligibility criteria for the study and the freedom to operate with respect to intellectual property 
delays in planned patient enrollment  or the need to enroll more patients  may result in increased costs and delays  which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop products 
we may encounter delays or rejections based on changes in regulatory agency policies during the period in which we develop a drug or the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval of a particular compound 
on may   changes went into effect in the regulation of clinical trials in europe 
our continuing compliance with these changes could lead to delays to our clinical trials 
we also may encounter delays in the event we are unable to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
in addition  we rely on a number of third parties  such as clinical research organizations  to help support the clinical trials by performing independent clinical monitoring  data acquisition and data evaluations 
any failure on the part of these third parties could delay the regulatory approval process 
failure to obtain regulatory approval or any delay or setback in obtaining regulatory agency approvals could adversely affect our ability to market any drugs we develop independently or with collaborative partners  impose additional costs and diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  or adversely affect our ability to generate royalties 
in particular  failure to obtain approval or substantial delays in obtaining approval for our lead product candidate  ai  would delay our receipt of product revenues and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that we will obtain any regulatory approvals in other countries and the failure to obtain these approvals may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to market our products outside of the united states  we and our current  and potential future  collaborative partners must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods 
the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval detailed above 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities of other countries 
in addition  many countries outside the united states require a separate review process prior to marketing to determine whether their national health insurance scheme will pay for newly approved products  as well as the price which may be charged for a product 
our products  if approved  may fail to achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that any products we successfully develop  if approved for marketing  will achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenues 
each of our product candidates is intended to replace or alter existing therapies or procedures  and hospitals  physicians or patients may conclude that these products are less safe or effective or otherwise less attractive than these existing therapies or procedures 
for example  our lead product candidate  ai  is a contrast agent for use in ultrasound imaging procedures which will compete with existing nuclear imaging and stress echocardiography 
hospitals  physicians or patients may prefer these existing procedures to ai enhanced ultrasound imaging 
if our products do not receive market acceptance for any reason  it would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  our competitors may develop new technologies or products that are more effective or less costly  or that seem more cost effective  than our products 
we can give no assurance that hospitals  physicians  patients or the medical community in general will accept and use any products that we may develop 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be unable to complete planned clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our product candidates 
we will require substantial future capital in order to continue to conduct the research and development  clinical and regulatory activities necessary to bring our product candidates to market and to establish commercial manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of pre clinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials  the timing of construction and size to which we expand our manufacturing capabilities  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the number of product candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  and the establishment of selected strategic alliances and activities required for product commercialization 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations and may seek funding through private or public sales of our securities or by licensing all or a portion of our technology 
this funding may significantly dilute existing stockholders or may limit our rights to our technology 
we cannot assure you that we can obtain additional funding on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stock price may decline  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution  and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to limitations on our operations and such debt may have rights senior to the debentures  if issued 
if we cannot obtain adequate funds  we may terminate or delay clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates  delay our establishment of sales  marketing and or manufacturing capabilities  curtail significant product development programs that are designed to identify new product candidates  relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates  and or terminate or delay build out and commissioning of our commercial manufacturing facility 
claims by other companies that we infringe their proprietary technology may result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts 
competitors and other third parties may initiate patent litigation against us in the united states or in foreign countries based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future 
many of our competitors have obtained patents covering products and processes generally related to our products and processes  and they may assert these patents against us 
moreover  there can be no assurance that these competitors have not sought or will not seek additional patents that may cover aspects of our technology 
as a result  there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our competitors were pursuing unrelated technologies 
while we conduct patent searches to determine whether the technologies used in our products infringe patents held by third parties  numerous patent applications are currently pending and may be filed in the future for technologies generally related to our technologies  including many patent applications that remain confidential after filing 
due to these factors and the inherent uncertainty in conducting patent searches  there can be no guarantee that we will not violate third party patent rights that we have not yet identified 
we know of us and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to aspects of our product candidates 
there may also be patent applications filed by these or other parties in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions that relate to some aspects of our product candidates  which  if issued  could subject us to infringement actions 
in particular  we are aware of us and foreign patents owned by third parties  including potential competitors  that arguably cover aspects of our ai contrast agent 
we and several of these parties have recently been actively engaged in opposing the grant of european patents with claims that arguably cover aspects of our ai product 
parties may contest patents in europe prior to contesting the counterpart patents in the united states because of procedural differences between european and us patent laws as well as economic considerations 
there is a significant possibility that one or more of these third parties will use litigation to assert their patents in the united states or europe 
the owners or licensees of these and other patents may file one or more infringement actions against us 
in addition  a competitor may claim misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee hired from that competitor 
any such infringement or misappropriation action could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and could distract our management from our business  even if the allegations of infringement or misappropriation are unwarranted 
the defense of multiple claims could have a disproportionately greater impact 
furthermore  a party making this type of claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from making  using  selling  offering for sale or importing our products or prevent our customers from using our products 
if a court determined or if we independently concluded that any of our products or manufacturing processes violated third party proprietary rights  our clinical trials could be delayed and there can be no assurance that we would be able to reengineer the product or processes to avoid those rights  or to obtain a license under those rights on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual propriety rights  our competitors may develop and market products with similar features that may reduce demand for our products  and we may be prevented from establishing collaborative relationships on favorable terms 
the following factors are important to our success receiving patent protection for our product candidates  maintaining our trade secrets  not infringing on the proprietary rights of others  and preventing others from infringing our proprietary rights 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
because the patent position of pharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions  the issuance  scope and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
if issued  they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed 
the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and technology  which are not protected by patents  to maintain our competitive position 
we try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it  such as our corporate partners  collaborators  employees and consultants 
any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our confidential information or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way 
if any trade secret  know how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time consuming 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties in the united states or in foreign countries 
in addition  we may become subject to interference or opposition proceedings conducted in patent and trademark offices to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense of intellectual property rights  including patent rights through lawsuits  interference or opposition proceedings  and other legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
for example  during the course of this kind of litigation  confidential information may be inadvertently disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests  depositions or trial testimony 
this disclosure could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
we have never manufactured any of our product candidates in commercial quantities  and if we fail to develop an effective manufacturing capability for our products  including our lead product candidate ai  we may be unable to commercialize these products 
we have no experience in manufacturing our products for commercial use and limited experience in designing equipment for the manufacture of our products 
we are working to build out and qualify a commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts and to demonstrate that we can produce ai at a commercial manufacturing scale prior to our filing of a nda for ai and  subject to required regulatory approvals  we intend to manufacture ai in this facility for commercial use 
we can not assure you that we will be able to successfully manufacture our products in sufficient quantities for commercial sale  or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for such commercial manufacture  at all or in a timely or economical manner 
our intention to manufacture ai or other products exposes us to the following risks  any of which could delay or prevent the approval of our products by the fda or corresponding state and foreign agencies  or the commercialization of our products  or result in higher costs or inability to meet demand for ai leading to potential revenue loss  and any of which would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in achieving volume production  quality control and quality assurance 
accordingly  we might not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of drugs to meet our clinical schedules or to commercialize our products 
manufacturers are obliged to manufacture in highly controlled environments and to operate in accordance with fda and international mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
for our clinical trials we have relied on contract manufacturers for such facilities and cgmp compliance 
in july  we entered into a lease for a facility in tewksbury  massachusetts that we intend to convert into a commercial manufacturing facility for ai creation and qualification of a commercial manufacturing environment requires significant expertise and capital resources  including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls and is subject to local and state planning approvals 
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in constructing and qualifying new manufacturing facilities and in production  especially in scaling up initial production 
a failure within this new facility to establish and follow cgmps and to document adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for our nda filing or commercial production for ai and may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products or the ability to continue to manufacture the products 
certain of these delays would further require us to continue to operate this facility and incur related costs 
manufacture of our product candidates  in preparation for filing a nda and for commercial production  will each initially require and rely on a single commercial manufacturing site  directly or through a contract manufacturer  without the backup of a second site that is qualified for commercial manufacture of the product 
qualification of another manufacturing site can be expensive and time consuming 
prior to using product from a new manufacturing site  we must demonstrate that the specifications for the product are consistent with the specifications for the product as it was manufactured at a prior qualified site or we must clinically or otherwise demonstrate that the safety and efficacy of the product produced in the new manufacturing site is consistent with the product as it was manufactured at the prior site 
demonstrating such consistency may be difficult  expensive or time consuming 
in addition  before we would be able to produce product for commercial use at a new facility  it will have to undergo a pre approval inspection by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies 
once approved  drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
failure to maintain compliance with cgmp or with safety or environmental regulations could result in penalties  product recalls or restrictions on the use of the manufacturing site 
under the terms of our collaboration agreement with nycomed  we are responsible for the commercial manufacture of ai for marketing and sale by nycomed in europe 
failure to manufacture ai in a timely manner or on an economic basis  or in sufficient quantities  could jeopardize our relationship with nycomed 
we do not currently have a european sales force  nor do we have experience with regard to the commercialization  marketing  sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products in europe  and we rely entirely on nycomed for this expertise 
any termination of our relationship with nycomed would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
it is our intention to remove our ai manufacturing equipment from the facilities of our third party contract manufacturer after which we will have no facility within which to manufacture ai until the new commercial manufacturing facility is built out and qualified or until other arrangements are made 
it is our intention in to remove our ai manufacturing equipment from its current location within the facilities of a third party contract manufacturer 
when we remove this manufacturing equipment  we expect that we will have sufficient inventory of ai clinical trial material to complete our phase program 
however  there can be no assurance that such inventory will prove sufficient or that the inventory will not get damaged or otherwise disqualified 
after we remove this manufacturing equipment  we will have no facility within which to manufacture ai until the new commercial manufacturing facility is built out and qualified or until other arrangements are made 
if we lack sufficient inventory of ai clinical trial material to complete our phase program or are unable to manufacture sufficient inventory on a timely basis  our phase program could be delayed and would consequently delay our ability to commercialize ai these delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if third party manufacturers of our products fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns  or if their performance is substandard  our clinical trials may be delayed and our costs may rise 
we may rely substantially on third party contract manufacturers to supply  store and distribute our potential products for our clinical trials and other development needs 
our reliance on these third party manufacturers will expose us to the following risks  any of which could delay or prevent the completion of our clinical trials  the approval of our products by the fda  or the commercialization of our products  result in higher costs  or deprive us of additional product candidates  and any of such effects would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties in achieving volume production  quality control and quality assurance  as well as shortages of qualified personnel 
accordingly  a manufacturer might not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of drugs to meet our clinical schedules 
contract manufacturers are obliged to operate in accordance with fda mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
a failure of these contract manufacturers to establish and follow cgmps and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical study and may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products 
for production of clinical trial material for each of our current product candidates we will initially rely on a single manufacturer 
changing these or future manufacturers may be difficult and the number of potential manufacturers is limited 
changing manufacturers may require re validation of the manufacturing processes and procedures in accordance with fda mandated cgmps 
such re validation may be costly and time consuming 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to find replacement manufacturers on acceptable terms quickly  or at all 
our contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to produce  store and distribute our products successfully 
our manufacturing levels  while important to us  can represent relatively small fractions of the overall business of most qualified contract manufactures 
as a result  the contract manufacturers may not provide us with the attention that we need or may be unwilling to adapt to necessary changes in our manufacturing requirements 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we are obligated to audit the performance of third party contractors  we do not have control over our third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
failure by our third party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of the government to grant market approval of drugs  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  seizures or recalls of product  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to manufacture our products in commercial quantities  which would prevent us from marketing our products 
to date our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for pre clinical and clinical trials 
if any of these product candidates are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities for commercial sale  we will need to manufacture them in larger quantities 
for ai  it is our intention to seek regulatory approval after we have demonstrated that we can manufacture ai at a larger batch scale than is being used for clinical trial materials 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity or manufacture at a larger batch scale  whether on our own or in collaboration with third party manufacturers  for any of our product candidates in a timely or economic manner  or at all 
significant scale up of manufacturing may require certain additional validation studies  which the fda must review and approve 
if we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate  the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply of that product candidate 
our product candidates require precise  high quality manufacturing 
our failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards  including controlling the incidence of manufacturing errors and maintaining reliable product packaging for diverse environmental conditions  could result in patient injury or death  product recalls or withdrawals  delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business 
materials necessary to manufacture our products may not be available  which may delay our development and commercialization activities 
only a few facilities manufacture some of the raw materials necessary to manufacture our products 
if we need to purchase a raw material that is in limited supply for our clinical trials  or for commercial distribution if we obtain marketing approval of a product candidate  we cannot assure you that one or more suppliers would be able to sell us that raw material at the time we need it and on commercially reasonable terms 
if we change suppliers for any of these materials or any of our suppliers experiences a shutdown or disruption in the facilities used to produce these materials  due to technical  regulatory or other problems  it could harm our ability to manufacture our products 
our inability to obtain required raw materials for any reason could substantially impair our development activities or the production  marketing and distribution of our products 
we have no experience selling  marketing or distributing our products and no internal capability to do so 
if we receive regulatory approval to commence commercial sales of any of our products  we will face competition with respect to commercial sales  marketing and distribution 
these are areas in which we have no experience 
to market any of our products directly  we must develop a direct marketing and sales force with technical expertise and supporting distribution capability 
alternatively  we may engage a pharmaceutical or other healthcare company with an existing distribution system and direct sales force to assist us 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully establish sales and distribution capabilities either on our own or in collaboration with third parties or gain market acceptance for our products 
to the extent we have or will enter co promotion or other licensing arrangements  any revenues we receive will depend on the efforts of third parties and there can be no assurance that our efforts will succeed 
we will establish collaborative relationships  and those relationships may expose us to a number of risks 
we will rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies for our manufacturing  research funding  clinical development and or sales and marketing performance 
reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks  including the following we cannot effectively control whether our corporate partners will devote sufficient resources to our programs or product candidates  disputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with collaborators  disagreements with collaborators could delay or terminate the research and development  regulatory approval or commercialization of product candidates  or result in litigation or arbitration  corporate partners may have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product candidates and may pursue technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors  and collaborators with marketing rights may choose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our product candidates than they do to product candidates of their own development 
in july  we entered into a collaboration  license and supply agreement with nycomed in which we granted nycomed rights to develop and market ai in europe 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory goals  sales targets and other objectives of this agreement will be achieved 
failure to achieve these goals  targets and objectives would result in our inability to receive license  milestone  royalty and other payments under this agreement  which would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations including  under certain conditions  reduction of royalty rates  delays in regulatory approvals and product sales  penalties and termination of the agreement 
under certain provisions of this collaboration agreement  if the company fails in any material respect to use all commercially reasonable efforts to carry out referenced obligations under the agreement  we would be obligated to pay nycomed liquidated damages of up to million 
although we plan to carry out all of these obligations  which we believe are in our control  there can be no assurance that termination of this agreement will not occur or that such termination would not result in the company incurring liquidated damages of up to million 
given these risks  our current and future collaborative efforts may not be successful 
failure of these efforts could delay our product development or impair commercialization of our products  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense  and if we fail to compete effectively our financial results will suffer 
we engage in a business characterized by extensive research efforts  rapid developments and intense competition 
we cannot assure you that our products will compete successfully or that research and development by others will not render our products obsolete or uneconomical 
our failure to compete effectively would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that successful competition will depend  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  timing and scope of regulatory approval and price 
specifically  we expect important factors will include the relative speed with which we can develop products  complete the clinical  development and laboratory testing and regulatory approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market 
we expect competition to increase as technological advances are made and commercial applications broaden 
in commercializing our initial product candidates and any additional products we develop using our hdds and pdds technologies  we will face substantial competition from large pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other companies  universities and research institutions 
ai  our ultrasound contrast agent and lead product candidate  if approved for marketing and sale  will compete with nuclear stress tests  the current standard of care in myocardial perfusion imaging 
nuclear contrast agents that are approved for use in myocardial perfusion imaging include products marketed by ge healthcare  bristol myers squibb and tyco international 
in  the cost of a nuclear stress test was approximately per procedure 
in addition  ge healthcare  bristol myers squibb and imcor have developed ultrasound contrast agents that have been approved by the fda for use in lvo and ebd in patients with suboptimal images  and in the future they may seek to broaden their products to include stress echo and myocardial perfusion assessment 
moreover  we are aware that other companies  such as bracco  are developing ultrasound contrast agents for wall imaging and for radiology applications  and that point biomedical is developing an ultrasound contrast agent specifically for myocardial perfusion imaging 
in  point announced that it had recently completed two pivotal phase trials for this contrast agent and planned to file an nda with the fda 
finally  some cardiologists may find it satisfactory to use stress echo without contrast for the detection of coronary heart disease 
ai  our reformulation of paclitaxel  if approved for marketing and sale  will also face intense competition from companies such as american pharmaceutical partners  neopharm and sonus pharmaceuticals  which are applying significant resources and expertise to developing reformulations of paclitaxel for intravenous delivery 
in early  american pharmaceutical partners received fda approval for their product 
other companies  such as cell therapeutics  are developing new chemical entities that involve paclitaxel conjugated  or chemically bound  to another chemical 
ai  our sustained release formulation of an asthma drug  if approved for marketing and sale  will also face intense competition 
companies such as alkermes possess technology that may be suitable for sustained release pulmonary drug delivery and may have competitive programs that have not been publicly announced or may decide to begin such programs in the future 
in addition  large pharmaceutical companies that market fda approved asthma drugs may be developing sustained release versions of their asthma drugs that would compete with our product candidates 
relative to us  most of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities and experience in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  as well as in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
many of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we will 
furthermore  we believe that some of our competitors have used  and may continue to use  litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
finally  our competitors may use different technologies or approaches to the development of products similar to the products we are seeking to develop 
if we are unable to retain key personnel and hire additional qualified scientific  sales and marketing  and other personnel  we may not be able to successfully achieve our goals 
we depend on the principal members of our scientific and management staff 
the loss of these principal members services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of these principal members 
we do not have employment contracts with any of these principal members 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and management personnel such as these individuals 
we face intense competition for such personnel and consultants 
we cannot assure you that we will attract and retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future 
further  we expect that our potential expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as further clinical trials  governmental approvals  commercial manufacturing and marketing  will place additional requirements on our management  operational and financial resources 
we expect these demands will require an increase in management and scientific personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel or to develop such expertise could materially adversely affect prospects for our success 
we expect to develop international operations that will expose us to additional business risks 
we expect  whether directly or through collaborative relationships  to develop operations outside the united states in order to market and distribute our products 
regardless of the extent to which we seek to develop these operations ourselves or in collaboration with others  we cannot be sure that our international efforts will be successful 
any expansion into international markets will require additional resources and management attention and will subject us to new business risks 
these risks could lower the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating results 
among the risks we believe are most likely to affect any international operations are different regulatory requirements for approval of our product candidates  dependence on local distributors  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  adverse changes in trade and tax regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  political and economic instability  and currency risks 
risks relating to our industry even if we obtain marketing approval  our products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly  post marketing follow up studies 
as to products for which marketing approval is obtained  the manufacturer of the product and the manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
in addition  the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or the manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we may be slow to adapt  or we may never adapt  to changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
market acceptance of our products will be limited if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement for products like our product candidates  and our commercial success will depend in part on these third party payors agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of our products 
even if we succeed in bringing any of our proposed products to market  we cannot assure you that third party payors will consider our products cost effective or provide reimbursement in whole or in part for their use 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
each of our product candidates is intended to replace or alter existing therapies or procedures 
these third party payors may conclude that our products are less safe  effective or cost effective than these existing therapies or procedures 
therefore  third party payors may not approve our products for reimbursement 
if third party payors do not approve our products for reimbursement or fail to reimburse them adequately  sales will suffer as some physicians or their patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement or is adequately reimbursed 
even if third party payors make reimbursement available  these payors reimbursement policies may adversely affect the ability of us and our potential collaborators to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states  the growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our products which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change in ways adverse to us before or after the fda or other regulatory agencies approve any of our proposed products for marketing 
while we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these legislative or regulatory proposals  if any government or regulatory agencies adopt these proposals they could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with the alleged or actual harm caused by our products or product candidates 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others 
this risk exists in clinical trials as well as in commercial distribution 
in addition  the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in general have been subject to significant medical malpractice litigation 
we may incur significant liability if product liability or malpractice lawsuits against us are successful 
furthermore  product liability claims  regardless of their merits  could be costly and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  or adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products 
although we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be certain that this coverage will be adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
rapid technological change could make our products obsolete 
pharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change 
we expect that pharmaceutical technologies will continue to develop rapidly 
our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies 
any compounds  products or processes that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with their development 
rapid technological change could make our products obsolete  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products involve the use of hazardous materials  and as a result we are exposed to potential liability claims and to costs associated with complying with laws regulating hazardous waste 
our research and development activities involve the use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and biological materials 
we believe that our procedures for handling hazardous materials comply with federal and state regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that accidental injury or contamination from these materials will not occur 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages  which could exceed our available financial resources 
this liability could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products  and we spent approximately  during the fiscal year ended december  to dispose of these hazardous materials and waste products 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our common stock we expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly 
we completed our initial public offering in october prior to this offering  you could not buy or sell our common stock publicly 
after this offering  the average daily trading volume for our common stock has been relatively low 
an active public market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained 
the stock market  particularly in recent years  has experienced significant volatility particularly with respect to pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks 
the volatility of pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock 
factors that could cause this volatility in the market price of our common stock include announcements of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products  our quarterly operating results  deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts  and fda or international regulatory actions 
the market price of our common stock may also fluctuate in response to the exercise by us of rights under the terms of our convertible preferred stock 
for example  we may elect to automatically convert the preferred stock if our common stock price has exceeded of the conversion price of the preferred stock for at least trading days during a day trading period ending within five trading days prior to the notice of automatic conversion 
there is a risk of fluctuation in the price of our common stock between the time when we may first elect to automatically convert the preferred stock and the automatic conversion date 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the value of the common stock 
our common stock is junior to our preferred stock with respect to the right to receive payments in the event of a dissolution  liquidation or winding up of acusphere 
in february  we issued and sold  shares of our convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
the preferred stock is senior to the common stock as to liquidation 
in the event of our voluntary or involuntary dissolution  liquidation or winding up of acusphere  holders of our preferred stock will receive a liquidation preference in an amount equal to per share  plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through the distribution date 
only after holders of the preferred stock have received their liquidation preference and any accrued and unpaid dividends will we distribute assets  if any are remaining  to our common stock holders 
we may be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
future sales of common stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market  or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march   we have  shares of common stock outstanding and  shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding that are convertible into approximately  shares of our common stock  plus up to a maximum of approximately  additional shares of our common stock issuable at our option in satisfaction of the maximum dividend make whole payment on these shares of preferred stock 
all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our preferred stock will be freely tradable without restriction under the federal securities laws unless purchased by our affiliates 
in addition  in november and december registration statements covering the re sale of up to  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  were declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission  at which time many of these shares first became eligible for re sale without restriction under federal securities laws 
if our common or preferred stockholders sell substantial amounts of our stock in the public market  or the market perceives that such sales may occur  the market price of our common and convertible preferred stock could fall 
additionally  in july and october of  we completed two separate closings of a private financing resulting in the issuance of  and  shares of common stock  respectively  and warrants to purchase up to an additional  and  shares of common stock  respectively 
we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering the resale of these shares and shares issued upon exercise of the warrants  which registration statement was declared effective by the sec on november   facilitating the resale of these shares from time to time  which could result in volatility of our stock price 
on december   we filed a registration statement with the sec covering the resale of an aggregate of  shares and  shares issued upon exercise of the warrants held by stockholders and warrant holders that held their shares and or warrants prior to our initial public offering or have subsequently received shares and or warrants in connection with services rendered to us 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on december   facilitating the resale of these shares from time to time  which could result in volatility of our stock price 
our directors and management will exercise significant control over our company 
our directors and executive officers and their affiliates collectively control approximately of our outstanding common stock  excluding unexercised options and warrants 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will be able to influence our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock 
the terms of our outstanding shares of preferred stock may restrict our ability to raise additional capital or hamper or prevent an acquisition of us 
in february we issued and sold  shares of our convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
in the event of our voluntary or involuntary dissolution  liquidation or winding up of acusphere  holders of our preferred stock will receive a liquidation preference in an amount equal to per share  plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through the distribution date 
only after holders of the preferred stock have received their liquidation preference and any accrued and unpaid dividends will we distribute assets  if any are remaining  to our common stock holders 
without the vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of preferred stock  we can not authorize or sell any equity security that ranks senior to the preferred stock as to dividends or distributions of assets upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of acusphere 
as a result of this liquidation preference  it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or junior preferred stock on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  without the vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of preferred stock we may not effect a consolidation or merger with another entity unless the preferred stock that remains outstanding and its rights  privileges and preferences are unaffected or are converted into or exchanged for preferred stock of the surviving entity having rights  preferences and limitations substantially similar  but no less favorable  to the convertible preferred stock 
this provision could hamper a third party s acquisition of us or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us via a merger 
under some circumstances  the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock may be entitled to elect some of the directors of acusphere 
in february we issued and sold  shares of our convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
cumulative dividends accrue on our preferred stock at an annual rate of per share  payable quarterly on the first day of march  june  september and december  commencing june  any dividends must be declared by our board of directors and must come from funds that are legally available for dividend payments 
if we have not paid dividends on the preferred stock in an aggregate amount equal to at least six quarterly dividends whether or not consecutive  we must increase the size of our board of directors by two additional directors 
after this time  and for so long as these dividends remain due and unpaid  holders of the preferred stock  voting separately as a class with holders of preferred stock ranking on the same basis as to dividends having like voting rights  will be entitled to elect two additional directors at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected 
these directors will be appointed to classes on the board as determined by our board of directors 
these voting rights will terminate when we have declared and either paid or set aside for payment all accrued and unpaid dividends 
the terms of office of all directors so elected will terminate immediately upon the termination of these voting rights 
provisions of delaware law or our charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  and could make it more difficult for you to change management 
provisions of delaware law or our charter or by laws could hamper a third party s acquisition of us  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us 
stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
further  these provisions make it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year 
these provisions include a provision allowing us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of the common stock  the existence of a staggered board of directors in which there are three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms  thus expanding the time required to change the composition of a majority of directors and potentially discouraging someone from making an acquisition proposal for us  the by laws requirement that stockholders provide advance notice when nominating our directors  the inability of stockholders to convene a stockholders meeting without the chairperson of the board  the chief executive officer  the president or a majority of the board of directors first calling the meeting  and the application of delaware law prohibiting us from entering into a business combination with the beneficial owner of or more of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the or greater owner first reached that level of stock ownership  unless we meet specified criteria 
we have never paid dividends on our capital stock  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have paid no cash dividends on our common stock to date and  other than cash dividends paid on our preferred stock  we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to fund the development and growth of our businesses 
in addition  the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying these dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and government grade securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of one year or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we currently have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our technology 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
