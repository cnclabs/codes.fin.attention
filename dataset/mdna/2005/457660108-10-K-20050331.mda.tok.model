the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview we are an ophthalmic product development company focused on ocular infections  glaucoma  and retinal diseases through three technology platforms that include our patented time release ophthalmic drug delivery system durasite  genomic research for the diagnosis  prognosis and management of glaucoma  and a retinal drug delivery device 
in  we faced significant challenges related to our lack of financial resources 
to continue our operations we took a number of actions to reduce our cash usage including we laid off approximately of our personnel  our senior management voluntarily reduced their salaries  we placed several development programs on hold  including those related to our isv technology  isv our retinal delivery device  and treatments for retinal diseases  we slowed the clinical activities related to azasite tm isv  and we instituted other cash saving actions including extending the payment of our liabilities 
on june   after receiving stockholder approval  we completed the final closing of a private placement of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to subscription agreements entered into between us and certain accredited investors on march  we raised an aggregate of approximately million  net of fees and expenses  through the sale and issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the initial and final closings of this private placement 
we expect that our current funds will be sufficient to permit us to continue our operations as currently planned until approximately the begining of june although we continue to carefully monitor our expenses  with the receipt of the additional funds from the private placement  we were able in june to restore management salaries to the same level as they were prior to the voluntary salary reductions and fully resume our clinical activities related to azasite 
with our existing resources we are focusing our research and development and commercial efforts on the following azasite isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin  a broad spectrum antibiotic  azasite plus isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin and a steroid  and targeted activities to support the scientific clinical foundation and market introduction of our ocugene glaucoma genetic test based on our isv technology 
azasite isv 
we have developed a topical formulation of the antibiotic azithromycin  an antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity that is widely used to treat respiratory and other infections in its oral and parenteral forms  to treat bacterial conjunctivitis and other infections of the outer eye 
we believe that the key advantages of azasite may include a significantly reduced dosing regimen doses vs 
doses for comparable products  the high and persistent levels of azithromycin achieved in the tissues of the eye and its wide spectrum of activity 
product safety and efficacy have been shown  respectively  in phase and phase clinical trials 
the phase study compared an azasite formulation containing azithromycin to a placebo 
the results of this study showed that the azasite formulation was statistically significantly more effective than the placebo in bacterial eradication and clinical cure  which includes reduction in inflammation and redness 
in july  we initiated two pivotal phase clinical trials for azasite 
one of the phase clinical trials is a multi center study in which patients in one arm will be dosed with a azasite formulation and the patients in the second arm will be dosed with a placebo 
this study is designed to include approximately patients  of which must be confirmed positive for acute bacterial conjunctivitis in at least one eye 
the other phase clinical trial is a multi center study in which patients in one arm will be dosed with a azasite formulation and the patients in the second arm will be dosed with a formulation of the antibiotic tobramycin 
this study is designed to include approximately patients  of which must be confirmed positive for acute bacterial conjunctivitis in at least one eye 
the phase trials are being conducted in the united states and we anticipate including both children and adults to permit aggressive enrollment of the subjects necessary to complete the studies 
the primary endpoints of both trials will be microbial eradication and clinical cure 
in october  we announced that over of the centers at which the clinical trials will be conducted have been activated and are able to begin to enroll patients in the two clinical trials 
in  we secured a new source for the active ingredient used in azasite and have a contract manufacturing site for production of clinical trial supplies and registration batches 
the supplies are being manufactured under the supervision of our personnel 
we are planning to manufacture the registration batches needed to support the filing of the new drug application  or nda  for azasite with the united states food and drug administration  or fda  at this contract facility in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that our contract manufacturing facility will be ready for inspection by the fda at the time of our nda submission 
azasite plus isv 
our first effort toward the expansion of our product candidate azasite into a larger franchise is the development of a combination of azasite with an anti inflammatory steroid for the treatment of blepharitis  an infection of the eyelid and one of the most common eye problems in older adults 
this combination product candidate is currently in preclinical development and will be more actively pursued as personnel and financial resources become available 
ocugene 
our ocugene glaucoma genetic test is based on our glaucoma genetics program  which has been pursued in collaboration with academic researchers  is focused on discovering genes that are associated with glaucoma  and the mutations on these genes that cause and regulate the severity of the disease 
in june  a peer reviewed study was published in clinical genetics titled association of the myocilin mt 
promoter variant with the worsening of glaucomatous disease over time  
the results of this study indicate substantial evidence that the tigr myoc mt 
variant provides a strong marker for accelerated worsening of both optic disc and visual field measures of glaucoma progression above and beyond other baseline risk factors  stated one of the authors of the study  jon polansky  md  university of california  san francisco  who also serves on our scientific advisory board 
in  the information from this article and previous publications was used to target specific thought leaders and ophthalmic centers in an effort to support the focused introduction of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test 
expanded marketing efforts were curtailed as we limited our cash use and we have not resumed the marketing efforts as we focus on our azasite clinical trials 
our current focus is on the clinical validation necessary to support use of this technology 
isv in december  we sold the isv product candidate to bausch lomb  or b l  which resulted in the receipt of million in cash  the return of the million of series a preferred stock  and the related dividends  to us for cancellation  and entitles us to receive royalties on future product sales  if any 
during the first nine months of  we provided contract research services to b l 
these activities have been completed and due to the sale  b l now is responsible for the further clinical development of the product and we are focusing our development efforts on our azasite product candidate 
from our inception through the end of  we did not receive any revenues from the sale of our products  other than a small amount of royalties from the sale of our aquasite product by ciba vision and global damon 
in the fourth quarter of  we commercially launched our ocugene glaucoma genetic test and early in we began to receive a small amount of revenues from the sale of this test 
with the exception of and the six month period ended june   we have been unprofitable since our inception due to continuing research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing of our product candidates 
we have financed our research and development activities and operations primarily through private and public placements of our equity securities  issuance of convertible debentures and  to a lesser extent  from collaborative agreements and bridge loans 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition 
we recognize up front fees from licensing and similar arrangements over the expected term of the related research and development services using the straight line method 
when changes in the expected term of ongoing services are identified  the amortization period for the remaining fees is appropriately modified 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized when the milestone is achieved based on the terms set forth in the related agreements 
revenue related to contract research services is recognized when the services are provided and collectibility is reasonable assured 
we directly reduced expenses for amounts reimbursed due to cost sharing agreements during the year ended december  we recognize the received cost sharing payments when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during the years ended and  we recognized cost reimbursements as contract and other revenue in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursement for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we receive royalties from licensees based on third party sales and the royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms  when third party results are reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to the sales of our product  the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  is recognized when all related services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  revenue for the sales of ocugene may be recognized in a later period than the associated recognition of costs of the services provided  especially during the initial launch of the product 
the revenue in connection with the sale of isv to b l was recognized over the contract period 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses include salaries  benefits  facility costs  services provided by outside consultants and contractors  administrative costs and materials for our research and development activities 
we also fund research at a variety of academic institutions based on agreements that are generally cancelable 
we recognize such costs as they are incurred 
cost of goods 
we recognize the cost of inventory shipped and other costs related to our ocugene glaucoma genetic test when they are incurred 
inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the inventory is based on the first in first out method 
if the cost of the inventory exceeds the expected market value a provision is recorded for the difference between cost and market 
at december   our inventories solely consisted of ocugene kits 
results of operations revenues 
we had total net revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  from contract research activities  sales of ocugene and sales of aquasite by ciba vision and kukje pharma ind 
co  ltd  our aquasite manufacturing partner in korea 
the increase in revenue is due to contract research activities conducted for bausch lomb in and under the isv asset purchase agreement 
we are no longer providing services to b l and we do not expect to derive revenue from these activities in or future years 
cost of goods 
cost of goods of   and  for  and  respectively  reflect the cost of ocugene tests performed as well as the cost of sample collection kits distributed for use 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million from million in compared to of this increase is due to the initiation of the azasite phase clinical trials and production of the related clinical supplies and registration batches 
the remainder of the increase reflects salary increases to our research staff to return such salaries to the same level they were prior to the voluntary salary reductions instituted in and costs related to increased research activities in support of our azasite program 
research and development expenses decreased to million from million in compared to this decrease reflects the personnel cost containment actions taken in the second quarter of and the reduction in support for external research which was begun in the first quarter of additionally  costs incurred in for the license of the optineuron gene from university of connecticut health center uchc and the related cost of new patent filings  were not incurred in as the majority of the initial filings were completed in in and  we received no r d cost reimbursements and in our r d cost reimbursements were million 
cost reimbursement in related to joint development programs to evaluate compounds for ophthalmic use 
our r d activities can be separated into two major segments  research and clinical development 
research includes activities involved in evaluating a potential product and the related pre clinical testing 
clinical development includes activities related to filings with the fda and the related human clinical testing required to obtain marketing approval for a potential product 
we estimate that the following represents the approximate cost of these activities for  and in thousands research clinical development total research and development due to our limited personnel and the number of projects that we are developing  our personnel are involved in a number of projects at the same time 
accordingly  the majority of our r d expenses are not linked to a specific project but are allocated across projects  based on personnel time expended on each project 
accordingly  the allocated costs may not reflect the actual costs of each project 
the increase in research activities in compared to reflects salary increases to our research staff to return such salaries to the same level they were prior to the voluntary salary reductions instituted in and costs related to increased patent and research activities in support of the azasite program 
the decrease in research activities in compared to reflects the cost containment efforts initiated in the second quarter of in may  we instituted a one month furlough  which included of our research personnel 
in june  approximately of the furloughed research personnel were laid off 
in we also continued to reduce our financial support of the research related to our genetics programs by not renewing certain research contracts pending the receipt of additional funding 
in a further effort to reduce expenses  we have reviewed  and will continue to review  our patent filings and will discontinue maintenance of patents and patent applications related to programs that we have determined not to pursue 
of the increase in clinical development expenses to million in from million in is related to the initiation of the azasite phase clinical trials in the remainder of the increase reflects the increase in staffing to support the azasite clinical trials and preparation for the related regulatory filings 
the decrease in clinical development expenses from million in to million in reflects the cost containment efforts initiated across the company in the second quarter of in may  we instituted a one month furlough  which included of our clinical development personnel 
in june  approximately of the furloughed clinical development personnel were laid off 
additionally  clinical development costs related to the ocugene glaucoma genetic test were reduced as the studies were completed in and no new studies were begun in most of our projects are in the early stages of the product development cycle and may not result in commercial products 
projects in development may not proceed into clinical trials due to a number of reasons even though the project looks promising early in the process 
once a project reaches clinical trials it may be found to be ineffective or there may be harmful side effects 
additionally  during the development cycle  other companies may develop new treatments that decrease the market potential for our project or be issued patents that require us to negotiate a license or cease pursuing one of our products and we may decide not to proceed 
other factors including the cost of manufacturing at a commercial scale and the availability of quality manufacturing capabilities could negatively impact our ability to bring the project to the market 
also  our business strategy is to license projects to third parties to complete the development cycle and to market and sell the product 
if we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements for any product candidate  our ability to commercialize the product may be slowed or we may decide not to proceed with that candidate 
these collaborative arrangements may either speed the development or they may extend the anticipated time to market 
because of these factors  as well as others  we cannot be certain if  or when  our projects in development will complete the development cycle and be commercialized 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in personnel related expenses increased in due to the payment of performance bonuses to our selling  general and administrative personnel in june and salary increases to these staff members to return such salaries to the same level they were prior to the salary reduction in this increase was partially offset by a reduction in our legal and financial service activities as expenses incurred in the second half of towards raising funds were not incurred in the second half of selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from in this reflects the approximately decrease in selling expenses related to the initial market introduction of ocugene in  such as advertising and our limited initial contract sales force 
the remaining decrease includes a decrease in personnel related costs due to the impact of the employee furloughs  lay offs and voluntary salary reductions instituted in while our legal costs related to our fund raising efforts and the cost of our insurance coverage  including directors and officers insurance increased approximately in compared to  these costs were more than offset by the other expense containment measures 
gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets reflects the sale of the isv product candidate to b l in december we received million in cash and b l surrendered the million of series a preferred stock  plus accumulated dividends  we had issued to them under the august license and preferred stock purchase agreements 
the total gain was recognized over the five month period that we had an obligation to provide contract research support for isv  which began in december and resulted in million and million being recognized in and  respectively 
interest  other income and expenses 
net interest  other income and expense was an expense of  and  in and  respectively  compared to income of  in this change both from to  and to  principally reflects the  of interest expense related to the debt discount of the convertible debentures recorded in  and interest expense related to the short term notes payable in and any interest earned or paid in the future will be dependent on our ability to raise additional funding and prevailing interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments from corporate collaborations 
at december   our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
it is our policy to invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes and corporate debt 
in march  we received approximately million  net of placement fees  from the initial closing of a total private placement of up to million 
in june  we completed the final closing of this private placement and received approximately million  net of placement fees 
our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report referring to our recurring operating losses and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
absent additional funding from other private or public equity or debt financings  collaborative or other partnering arrangements  asset sales  or other sources  we expect that our cash on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations and current cash commitments to us will only be adequate to fund our operations until approximately the begining of june if we are unable to secure sufficient additional funding prior to that time  we will need to cease operations and liquidate our assets  most of which is secured by a note to an officer who is also a board member 
our financial statements were prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
even if we are able to obtain additional financing in order to continue long term operations beyond the begining of june  we will require and will seek additional funding through collaborative or other partnering arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings  asset sales and from other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain interim or longer term financing or that such funding  if obtained  will be sufficient to continue our operations as currently conducted or in a manner necessary for the continued development of our products or the long term success of our company 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  such debt will be secured by a security interest or pledge of all of our assets  will require us to make principal and interest payments  would likely include the issuance of warrants and may subject us to restrictive covenants 
in addition  our stockholders may suffer substantial dilution if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities 
for the years ended december   and  cash used for operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
cash from used in investing activities were   and  primarily related to an increase in restricted cash  proceeds received from the sale of assets and cash outlays for additions to laboratory and other equipment made during  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of an aggregate of million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock in the initial and final closings of the march private placement 
we received million in the first quarter of from the issuance of  shares of our series a preferred stock to b l under the isv license agreement 
we issued million of short term notes payable in to directors  members of senior management and other stockholders 
these notes bear interest at rates from to and are due from january  through march  in we repaid  of these notes in cash 
in the year ended december  we received  net of debt issuance costs of approximately  from the issuance of convertible debentures 
these debentures were later converted into  shares of common stock in in  we received  from the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options by employees and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan compared to  in and  in during we also received  in connection with private placements of our common stock 
we received payments on a note to a stockholder of   and  in  and  respectively 
we also made  of payments on capital leases for certain laboratory equipment in compared to  in and  in assuming we are able to obtain additional financing and continue our operations  our future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our clinical testing  research and development programs and preclinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to successfully commercialize azasite  ocugene and any other products that we may launch in the future  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative and licensing relationships  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
we anticipate no material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on our environmental compliance record to date  and our belief that we are current in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations licensing agreement obligations total commitments we lease our facilities under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in we have entered into certain license agreements that require us to make minimum royalty payments for the life of the licensed patents 
the life of the patents which may be issued and covered by the license agreements cannot be determined at this time  but the minimum royalties due under such agreements are as noted for through and are approximately  per year until the first commercial sale  increase to  per year in the first three years of sales  and then increase to  per year until the expiration of the related patents 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in consolidated statements of operations 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
there are a number of requirements under the new standard that would result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  and we will begin to apply it in the quarter beginning on that date 
we believe that employee stock options represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program 
we grant options to substantially all employees and believes that this broad based program helps us to attract  motivate  and retain high quality employees  to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders 
the adoption of sfas r is expected to result in a material increase in expense during the second half of based on unvested options outstanding as of december  and current compensation plans 
while the effect of adoption depends on the level of share based payments granted in the future and unvested grants on the date we adopt sfas r  the effect of this accounting standard on its prior operating results would approximate the effect of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  the company will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
at december   we had million invested in interest bearing operating accounts 
while a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates by percent from the december  levels would cause a decrease in interest income  it would not result in a loss of the principal 
additionally  the decrease in interest income would not be material
