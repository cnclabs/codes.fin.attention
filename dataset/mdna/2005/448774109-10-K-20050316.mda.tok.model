item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of hydril s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with hydril s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged worldwide in engineering  manufacturing and marketing premium connection and pressure control products used for oil and gas drilling and production 
our premium connection products are marketed primarily to exploration and production company operators  who are the end users 
we sell our pressure control products primarily to drilling contractors for use in oil and gas drilling and to a lesser extent to exploration and production companies for oil and gas production 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent on the activity levels in the oil and gas industry and our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
the level of these capital expenditures is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and gas prices  which have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
generally  increasing commodity prices result in increased oil and gas exploration and production  which translates into greater demand for oilfield products and services 
conversely  falling commodity prices generally result in reduced demand for oilfield products and services 
historically  changes in budgets and activity levels by oil and gas exploration and production companies have lagged significant movements in commodity prices 
the level of world wide drilling activity  in particular  the number of rigs drilling at target depths greater than  feet and the number of rigs drilling offshore generally drive the level of demand for our premium connection products  although the rate of consumption varies widely among markets based on specific geological formations  customer history and preference  and available alternatives 
the main factors that affect sales of pressure control capital equipment products are the level of construction of new drilling rigs and the rate at which existing rigs are refurbished 
demand for our pressure control aftermarket replacement parts  repair and field services primarily depends upon the level of worldwide offshore drilling activity  as well as the total us rig count 
beginning in mid  the price of oil increased significantly due to opec member countries reducing production and recovering worldwide demand for oil 
in addition  natural gas prices increased significantly during this period and peaked in late as a result of low levels of gas storage in the united states 
these higher prices triggered a substantial increase in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the united states and canada 
the average weekly rig count for the united states and canada combined for  as measured by baker hughes  increased over the average weekly rig count for rig counts continued to improve during the first half of with the combined rig count for the united states and canada peaking in july of these improvements in market fundamentals stimulated an increase in the demand for our products in the united states and canada  in particular premium connection products and pressure control aftermarket replacement parts 
in response to this increase in demand  we completed a expansion of our premium connection capacity at our plant in nisku  canada in january  and increased capacity in the united states by during and however  beginning mid  commodity prices started to fall  particularly natural gas prices  which fell sharply  and averaged mm btu henry hub in the fourth quarter of  down from the first quarter 
west texas intermediate crude oil prices declined as well  from an average of per barrel in the 
table of contents first quarter of to an average of per barrel in the fourth quarter  down 
this decline in commodity prices led to a decline in drilling activity in the united states and canada  in particular in the number of rigs drilling in deep formations for natural gas in north america 
the rig counts in the united states and canada combined  as measured by baker hughes  fell from july to december this decrease included a reduction in the number of rigs drilling over  feet 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we began to experience a decline in demand for premium connections and late in that quarter  a significant decrease in plant utilization in the united states 
accordingly  we reduced our premium connection workforce at our manufacturing facilities in the united states by approximately in january during  commodity prices began to recover from their levels in the fourth quarter of from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  us natural gas prices increased and us crude oil prices rose 
however  the commodity price recovery  which in part was fueled by global uncertainties over the war with iraq and political unrest and a labor strike in venezuela  was accompanied by a decrease in drilling activity 
for  several factors contributed to the decrease in spending by oil and gas companies for oil and gas exploration and development in the united states despite increasing commodity prices 
first  the downturn in the us economy during resulted in reduced capital spending by our customers 
these conservative spending practices focused on balance sheet improvements  primarily paying down debt  rather than spending for exploration and production 
in addition  the uncertainty of global events  most significantly the possibility of a war in iraq  led to less spending 
as a result  rig counts in the united states and canada were reduced and demand for premium connections and aftermarket parts and service decreased during commodity prices during were relatively stable and were up from average us crude oil prices for increased from the average and natural gas prices increased from the average 
as a result of these higher  more stable commodity prices  drilling activity in the united states rose throughout the year 
the us rig count ended at  which was above the year ended the average us deep formation rig count rigs drilling to a target depth greater than  feet ended at  an increase of over the year ended internationally  drilling activity overall also increased  although not to the same extent as domestic levels 
the international rig count rigs drilling outside of the united states and canada ended at  up from the year ended the worldwide offshore rig count for the year ended of was up compared with the year ended despite stable commodity prices and rising rig counts in the united states during  there was lower demand for premium connections in the united states market as a result of distributors reducing inventory stocking levels and placing only limited replenishment orders 
in addition deep formation and deep water drilling activity did not recover proportionately to the overall rig count increase 
many of the rigs returning to work in the united states and canada during were for shallow wells that do not require premium connection products 
however  the rising rig count during the year resulted in higher demand for aftermarket parts and service for pressure control products 
while the international rig count increased overall in  certain key oil and gas markets such as nigeria and venezuela had lower rig counts which diminished revenue opportunities 
political and civil uncertainties in these markets dampened the level of spending by oil and gas companies operating there 
during  commodity prices continued their upward trend which began in average us crude oil prices increased from and average natural gas prices increased from as a result  drilling activity in the united states rose throughout the year 
the us rig count ended at  which was above the year ended and the average us rig count for was up over the us deep formation rig count rigs drilling to a target depth greater than  feet for averaged  an increase of from and ended the year at  an increase of over the year ended internationally  drilling activity overall also increased  although not to the same extent as domestic levels 
the international rig count rigs drilling outside of the united states and canada ended at  up from the year ended the worldwide offshore rig count for the year ended was compared to for the year ended as a result of rising rig counts in the united states  and in particular the increase in the deep formation rig count  demand for our premium connections in the us increased during in addition to the 
table of contents improvement in demand due to increased drilling activity  in customers generally stopped drawing down on their inventories of our products  which resulted in an additional incremental increase in customer orders and revenues 
in contrast  during  customers satisfied the increased demand for premium connections in part by significantly drawing down on their inventories of our products  which adversely affected our sales in we have a greater presence in some international markets than others 
as a result  the success of our premium connections business internationally is particularly influenced by the level of drilling activities in certain locations that use our products 
for  demand in certain of our key international markets was considerably better than indicated by the slight increase in the overall international rig count 
in particular  demand in latin america was much stronger than the previous year 
announced plans to increase oil and gas drilling in venezuela and mexico helped to increase demand for our products in those countries 
our pressure control aftermarket revenue is influenced by the level of drilling activity throughout the world as measured by the u 
s rig count and the worldwide offshore rig count  both of which were up during the year 
as a result  our customers purchased a higher level of spare parts and repair services during as compared to demand in the industry for new pressure control capital equipment was not as strong during the period of through as compared to demand for aftermarket replacement parts  due to the low level of rig construction and refurbishment worldwide 
however  in march  our pressure control segment received a million order for four offshore drilling blowout prevention and control systems from globalsantafe corporation 
additionally during we received two orders from a subsidiary of diamond offshore drilling  inc for blowout preventer multiplex control systems 
during and  we benefited from these orders as revenue and gross profit was recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method and significant progress on the orders was made during the year 
substantially all of these orders were completed during and during  the capital equipment market continued to be weak  and we received no new significant capital equipment orders 
due to these market conditions  capital equipment revenue decreased during and was down compared to however because of the increasing us rig count  the pressure control aftermarket business increased in as compared to and in as compared to revenue with the exception of revenue from pressure control long term projects  we record revenue for all products and services at the time such products are delivered or services are provided 
in  of our revenue was recorded on this basis 
for our pressure control long term projects which are generally contracts from six to eighteen months in duration and an estimated contract price in excess of million  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to estimated final cost 
we use this method because we consider expended contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
if a long term contract was anticipated to have an estimated loss  such loss would be recognized in the period in which the loss becomes apparent 
see critical accounting estimates for more information regarding estimates and assumptions relating to revenue recognition 
gross profit our gross profit is the difference between our revenue and our cost of sales 
cost of sales for our products include purchased raw materials and components  manufacturing labor  plant overhead expenses  and building and equipment depreciation 
some of the costs are fixed cost and cause our margins to suffer when demand is low and manufacturing capacity is underutilized 
also included in cost of sales are the costs of product warranty  product liability insurance and inventory valuation adjustments  including last in  first out inventory valuation adjustments and adjustments for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we do not take title to the tubulars we thread for the united states and canadian market  and therefore  own no inventories of tubulars for sales in these countries 
however  we purchase tubulars for fulfilling a portion of our existing orders outside 
table of contents of the united states and canada  which is generally less than of our total revenue 
for our pressure control products  we have inventory for existing orders in process as well as a replacement parts inventory both internationally and domestically 
a majority of our inventory is for our pressure control segment 
selling  general and administration expenses our selling  general and administration expenses include engineering expenses that relate to research  product design  development and maintenance  as well as sales and marketing expenses  which consist mostly of personnel and related expenses  and commissions paid to third party agents selling our products 
also included are general and administration expenses that relate to accounting  treasury  information technology  human resources  legal expenses and corporate overhead 
operating income loss our operating income loss is gross profit less selling  general and administration expenses 
operating income loss is comprised of the operating income of each of our premium connection and pressure control segments and the portion of selling  general and administration expenses  referred to as corporate administration  which is not allocated to either segment 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue increased to million and pressure control revenue decreased to million 
the increase in premium connection revenue was primarily the result of higher demand in certain markets  primarily latin america  which included some restocking orders for venezuela 
in addition  increases in north america were due to higher sustained levels of deep formation drilling activity  operator mix within that sector and the cessation in general of distributor s drawing down their inventory  which had negatively impacted order levels in the decrease in pressure control revenue was attributable to a decrease in revenue from capital equipment due to lower revenue from long term projects consistent with the low level of new rig construction and refurbishment in the industry 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in pressure control aftermarket revenue  primarily repair and service activity  which resulted from increasing rig counts and drilling activity worldwide 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for from million in gross profit in our premium connection segment increased due primarily to higher demand in both our international and domestic markets and price increases in selected international markets 
this higher demand led to higher plant utilization  and accordingly lower  manufacturing costs per unit 
pressure control gross profit increased from the prior year period due to increased revenue from higher margin aftermarket products and was partially offset by a decline in capital equipment revenue which resulted in lower plant utilization and higher manufacturing costs per unit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was primarily the result of employee incentive plan accruals related to the improved financial performance  higher expenses related to the compliance with the sarbanes oxley act requirements  and higher agent commissions due to increased international sales 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for from for 
table of contents operating income operating income increased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment increased to million for compared to million for operating income for our pressure control segment increased million  or  from million for to million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense there was no interest expense in compared to million in during the second quarter of  our remaining debt of million was repaid 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for compared to million for the year ended included a million us income tax benefit extraterritorial income exclusion  related to export shipments and a million research and experimentation us tax credit  while the prior year included a research and experimentation us tax credit of million 
the extraterritorial income exclusion deduction recorded in is for years and the research and experimentation credit recorded in covers qualified spending for the two year period from to  while the credit recorded in covers qualified spending for the ten year period from through prior to  the company was an alternative minimum tax payer and accordingly could not benefit from the research and experimentation tax credit 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue decreased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue decreased to million and pressure control revenue decreased to million 
the decrease in premium connection revenue was primarily the result of lower demand in certain international markets  primarily west africa  due in part to political and civil uncertainties  and the united states as a result of our distributors reducing inventory stocking levels and placing only limited replenishment orders 
the decrease in pressure control revenue was attributable to a decrease in revenue from capital equipment due to a lower level of long term capital projects in backlog  consistent with the low level of new rig construction and refurbishment in the industry generally 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in aftermarket revenue due to an increase in the us total rig count and consumption of spare parts in the drilling process 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for from million in this decline was not as severe as the revenue decline because lower sales volumes were partially offset by a product mix shift in our pressure control segment from lower margin capital equipment to higher margin aftermarket replacement parts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was the result of consulting fees related to the research and experimentation income tax credit study see provision for income taxes below for details  and other tax planning strategies  expenses related to merger and acquisition activities  and higher legal expenses related to corporate governance compliance  which were partially offset by lower management incentive accruals 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from for to for 
table of contents operating income operating income decreased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment decreased to million for compared to million for operating income for our pressure control segment increased million  or  from million for to million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense interest expense decreased million to million for  from million in the reduction in interest expense was due to lower outstanding debt compared to as well as the payoff of our remaining debt at the end of the second quarter of provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily the result of a research and experimentation tax credit of million that was recorded during the third quarter of this credit covers qualified spending for the ten year period from through prior to  the company was an alternative minimum tax payer and could not benefit from this type of tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  fund new product development and provide additional working capital 
our primary source of funds is cash flow from operations 
in addition  we had available cash  cash equivalents and investments of million at december   and also had the capacity to borrow up to million under our committed revolving credit facilities 
at december   we had million in outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding indebtedness 
we believe that cash from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements  including working capital needs  contractual obligations and planned capital expenditures  for at least the next months 
in the longer term  if we were to need additional cash  we could borrow under our credit facilities and anticipate that we could also raise additional funds through issuing debt or equity securities 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of earnings and contractual cash payments received on long term capital equipment projects 
cash provided by operations in was primarily due to earnings and contractual cash payments received from customers on long term capital equipment projects  which was partially offset by a million contribution to the us defined benefit pension plan 
cash provided by operations in of million was primarily from earnings  contractual cash payments received from customers for progress made on capital equipment long term projects and utilization of deferred tax assets  the effects of which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million in the investment of cash in was primarily for net investments in marketable securities of million and capital spending of million while the investment of cash in of million was primarily for capital spending of million and million in net investments in marketable securities 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities for was million which was attributable to capital spending of million and net investments in held to maturity securities of million 
for more information on capital expenditures for the three years ended december  see capital expenditures below 
financing activities during  we received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million compared to million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
during  we repaid million of senior notes at maturity and as a result have no outstanding indebtedness 
during  we repaid million of debt 
credit facilities we have two unsecured revolving lines of credit for working capital requirements that provide up to million in total committed revolving credit borrowings through june  of these  million relates to our us operations and million relates to our foreign operations 
under these lines  we may borrow  at our election  at either a prime or libor based interest rate 
interest rates fluctuate depending on our leverage ratio and are prime minus a spread ranging from to basis points or libor plus a spread ranging from to basis points 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility 
the us revolving line of credit contains financial covenants which require us to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth and not to exceed a specified level of indebtedness or a maximum leverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
our foreign line of credit does not contain any separate financial covenants but contains cross default provisions which would be triggered by a default under our us line of credit 
the terms of the company s credit facilities allows for the issuance of letters of credit 
the amount of outstanding letters of credit reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facilities 
the letters of credit are generally short in duration and immaterial in amount 
at december  there was approximately million outstanding in letters of credit 
contractual cash obligations the following paragraph summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in millions operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total represents obligations for minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases 
the company s lease commitments are primarily for operating facilities  vehicles and equipment 
represents obligations under outstanding purchase orders and other commitments and estimated future cash payments pursuant to contractual obligations related to investments for product line expansions 
represents estimated future cash payments for post retirement health and life benefits  pension plan benefits and deferred compensation 

table of contents other indebtedness in june  the company issued million of senior notes due june  during the third quarter of  the company prepaid million of the aggregate principal amount of the unsecured notes plus a make whole premium of million relating to this prepayment 
the make whole premium was included as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company repaid the remaining million at maturity on june  capital expenditures capital expenditures for were million  which included million for our premium connection segment and million for our pressure control segment  in both cases primarily to support plant equipment replacements and upgrades  and million for general corporate purposes 
capital expenditures for were million  which included million for our premium connection segment and million for our pressure control segment  in both cases primarily to support plant and equipment for our manufacturing operations  and million for general corporate purposes 
capital expenditures for were million  which included million in our premium connection segment of which million related to plant capacity expansion and million related to support of manufacturing operations 
also included was million in our pressure control segment  of which million was used to replace and refurbish machine tools and to construct a new deepwater assembly building for blowout preventer stack assembly at our houston plant and million was used to support engineering research and development and manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for general corporate purposes were million for if current industry conditions continue  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately to million  primarily to support manufacturing operations and engineering  research and development activities 
dividends we have not paid any dividends on our common stock or our class b common stock since prior to our initial public offering in october we have no plans to declare or pay any dividends in the immediate future 
any declaration of a dividend would be dependent upon hydril s results of operations  financial condition  cash position and requirements  investment and acquisition opportunities  future prospects  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
backlog pressure control capital equipment backlog which includes orders for capital equipment and long term projects  at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we recognize the revenue and gross profit from pressure control long term projects using the percentage of completion accounting method 
as revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  the order value in backlog is reduced 
it is possible for orders to be cancelled  however  in the event of cancellations all costs incurred would be billable to the customer 
our backlog of premium connection and pressure control aftermarket parts and service is not a meaningful measure of business prospects due to the quick turnover of such orders and the majority of such orders are cancelable at will by the purchaser without penalty 
tax matters as of december   we had deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  of million 
these assets are benefits to us as long as we expect to have sufficient future income in the united states 
management projections indicate that sufficient income will be generated in future years to realize the tax assets  and therefore  no valuation allowance was required 

table of contents we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions on our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings are subjected to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
we believe that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law 
resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly we provide taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies  only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings 
we believe that the amount currently provided for potential assessments will not be settled in the next twelve months and such amount does not have a significant impact on our liquidity 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in
