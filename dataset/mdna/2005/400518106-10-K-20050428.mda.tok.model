our business general we operate on a week or week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in february 
fiscal and were week years 
fiscal was a week year and we included the extra week in our fourth quarter ended february  we are a global gaming and technology company providing software  networks and professional services that power high performance  transaction processing systems 
we are the world s leading operator of highly secure online lottery transaction processing systems  doing business in countries worldwide and we have a growing presence in commercial gaming technology gaming solutions and financial services transaction processing commercial services 
a comparison of our revenue concentration is as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal consolidated revenues lottery commercial services gaming solutions being a global business  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from our operations outside of the united states 
in particular  in fiscal  we derived of our revenues from international operations  including of our revenues from our brazilian operations alone including of our revenues from caixa economica federal  the operator of brazil s national lottery  our second largest customer in fiscal based on annual revenues 
in addition  substantial portions of our assets  primarily consisting of equipment we use to operate online lottery systems for our customers  are held outside of the united states 
we are also exposed to more general risks of international operations  including increased governmental regulation of the online lottery industry in the markets where we operate  exchange controls or other currency restrictions  and significant political instability 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the rendering of services and the sale or supply of computerized online lottery systems and components to government authorized lotteries 
our service revenues are derived primarily from lottery service contracts  which are typically at least five to seven years in duration  and generally provide compensation to us based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross online and instant ticket sales 
these percentages vary depending on the size of the lottery and the scope of services provided to the lottery 
we primarily derive product sale revenues from the installation of new online lottery systems  installation of new software and sales of lottery terminals and equipment in connection with the expansion of existing lottery systems 
our product margins fluctuate depending on the mix  volume and timing of product sale contracts 
our product sale revenues from period to period may not be comparable due to the size and timing of product sale transactions 
during fiscal  we currently anticipate that product sales will be in the range of million to million 
our compensation under lottery service contracts is typically based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross online and instant ticket sales 
over the past several fiscal years  we have experienced and may continue to experience a reduction in the percentage of lottery ticket sales we receive from certain customers resulting from contract rebids  extensions and renewals due to a number of factors  including the substantial growth of lottery sales over the last decade  reductions in the cost of technology and telecommunications services  and general market and competitive dynamics 
in anticipation and response to these trends  beginning in fiscal  we began the implementation of our new enterprise series led technology strategy combined with the implementation of a number of ongoing cost savings initiatives and efficiency improvement programs designed to enable us to maintain our market leadership in the lottery industry 
we are unable to determine at this time the likely effect of this trend on our business 
our business is highly regulated  and the competition to secure new government contracts is often intense 
in addition  our ability to consummate the acquisition  which we announced in december  of a percent controlling equity interest in the atronic group of companies  one of the world s five largest manufacturers of slot machines  and to otherwise expand our business in non lottery gaming markets  is contingent upon obtaining required gaming licenses 
from time to time  competitors challenge our contract awards and there have been  and may continue to be  investigations of various types  including grand jury investigations conducted by government authorities into possible improprieties and wrongdoing in connection with efforts to obtain and or the awarding of lottery contracts and related matters 
because such investigations frequently are conducted in secret  we may not necessarily know of the existence of an investigation which might involve us 
because our reputation for integrity is an important factor in our business dealings with lottery  gaming licensing  and other governmental agencies  a governmental allegation or a finding of improper conduct on our part or attributable to us in any manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to retain existing contracts  obtain new or renewal contracts and to expand our business in non lottery gaming markets 
in addition  continuing adverse publicity resulting from these investigations and related matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
see the following for further information concerning these matters and other contingencies part i  item certain factors that may affect future performance government regulations and other actions affecting the online lottery industry could have a negative effect on our business and sales  part i  item legal proceedings  note to the consolidated financial statements 
brazil matters revenues from our lottery contract with caixa economica federal cef  our customer and the operator of brazil s national lottery  accounted for of our total fiscal revenues  making cef our second largest customer in fiscal based upon annual revenues 
a june  ruling the ruling in a civil action initiated by federal attorneys with brazil s public ministry had the effect in fiscal of materially reducing payments that we otherwise would have received from our lottery contract with cef which expires in may the ruling ordered that of payments subsequent to the ruling due to gtech brasil ltda  our brazilian subsidiary gtech brazil from cef  be withheld and deposited in an account maintained by the court 
as of february   the total amount withheld and deposited in an account maintained by the court was approximately million brazilian reals  or million 
in fiscal  we did not recognize service revenues for the payments that were withheld from gtech brazil  as realization of these amounts was not reasonably assured 
in july we filed an appeal of the ruling and in march after the close of fiscal  an appellate court decision ordered that the withholding be discontinued and that all funds currently held in escrow in excess of million brazilian reals be returned to us  which amounts to million of the million withheld as of february  we received and recognized these funds as service revenue on april  in addition  the ruling ordered that all assets of gtech brazil be identified to the court so as to prevent their transfer or disposition  a requirement that was also subsequently reversed by the appellate court decision in march as of february   gtech brazil assets approximated million as follows dollars in millions cash systems  equipment and other assets relating to contracts  net assets restricted from transfer or disposition all other assets gtech brazil assets at february  the restricted cash of million is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are currently involved in negotiations with cef respecting the possible extension of the term of our current contract  which expires in may  for the provision of goods and services by us after the scheduled termination date of our current contract 
foreign currency translation related to our operations in brazil of million which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet at february   would be recorded as a charge to our consolidated income statement upon the expiration of our contract with cef should we determine that the expiration of the cef contract results in a substantial liquidation of our investment in brazil 
refer to part i  item  legal proceedings brazilian legal proceedings  the cef contract proceedings  and note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed disclosures regarding this matter 
acquisitions billbird sa during the third quarter of fiscal  our majority owned subsidiary  polcard sa polcard  acquired privately held billbird s 
a billbird  the leading provider of electronic bill payment services in poland  for an all cash purchase price of approximately million 
by combining billbird and polcard which is the leading debit and credit card merchant transaction acquirer and processor company in poland  we will enhance our market strategy of providing a product suite including debit and credit transaction processing  card and atm management services  electronic bill payments  and prepaid mobile phone top ups 
leeward islands lottery holding company inc 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired privately held leeward islands lottery holding company inc lilhco  a lottery operating company headquartered on the caribbean islands of antigua and st 
croix  for an all cash purchase price of approximately million 
by acquiring caribbean based lilhco  we will enhance our strategic foothold in that region  as well as provide significant growth opportunities in additional jurisdictions throughout the caribbean 
spielo manufacturing incorporated during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired privately held spielo manufacturing incorporated spielo  a leading provider of video lottery terminals vlt s and related products and services to the global gaming industry  for an all cash purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  we paid spielo shareholders approximately million out of a potential maximum earn out amount of up to million  which spielo shareholders are entitled to receive in the months following the closing  based upon spielo achieving certain vlt installation objectives in new york and separately  a working capital adjustment of approximately million 
by acquiring spielo  we will be better able to deliver a comprehensive  integrated vlt solution to our existing and potential customers  with a single point of contact and accountability 
we currently do not expect to pay any significant amounts remaining under the earn out provision 
we continue to evaluate a variety of opportunities to broaden our offerings of high volume transaction processing services outside of our core market of providing online lottery services  such as the processing and transmission of commercial  non lottery transactions including bill payments  electronic tax payments  utility payments  prepaid cellular telephone recharges and retail based programs such as gift cards 
currently  our networks in brazil  poland  chile  the czech republic and jamaica process bill payments and other commercial service transactions 
in the near term  we expect to concentrate our efforts to grow commercial service revenues principally in central and eastern europe and other selected emerging economies 
while our goal is to leverage our technology  infrastructure and relationships to drive growth in commercial services  if  in the course of pursuing these opportunities  we identify an opportunity to gain access to certain markets through the acquisition of existing businesses  we may consider making such acquisitions 
common stock split and treasury stock retirement on june   our board of directors approved a for common stock split  payable in the form of a stock dividend  which entitled each shareholder of record on july  to receive one share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock held on that date 
the stock dividend was distributed on july  all references to common shares and per share amounts herein have been restated to reflect the stock split for all periods presented 
in connection with the declaration of the stock dividend  our board of directors approved the retirement of million shares of our common stock held in treasury on july  stated on a basis reflecting the stock split which occurred subsequent to the retirement 
the million of treasury stock at the time of the retirement was eliminated from treasury stock through a charge to retained earnings and common stock 
new accounting pronouncements fasb statement no

sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  our fiscal first quarter 
early adoption is permitted 
we plan to adopt sfas r on the first day of fiscal february  
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective transition mpt method or the modified retrospective transition mrt method 
under the mpt method  compensation cost for new awards and modified awards are recognized beginning with the effective date and the cost for awards that were granted prior to  but not vested as of the effective date  will be based on the grant date fair value estimate used for sfas pro forma disclosure purposes 
the mrt method includes the requirements of the mpt method but also permits restatement of all prior periods presented or only the prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas r using the mpt method and we intend to use a lattice model to value stock options granted after february  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb and related interpretations  and as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we currently estimate the impact of adopting sfas r will be in a range of to per diluted share in fiscal sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for these excess tax deductions were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

 accounting for income taxes sfas  to the provision of the american jobs creation act of the act that provides a tax deduction on qualified production activities 
the fasb staff believes that the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas as opposed to a tax rate reduction 
fsp is effective immediately 
pursuant to the act  we will be able to benefit from a tax deduction for qualified production activities in fiscal we will follow the provisions of this guidance when applicable 
we have not yet determined the impact this tax deduction will have on our results of operations or financial position

 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides for a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision and is effective immediately 
while we continue to evaluate the act  we do not plan to elect the one time provision because of the resulting loss of foreign tax credits and because the vast majority of our permanently reinvested non us earnings have been deployed in active non us business operations 
eitf in october  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force s consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf  which is effective for periods ending after december  under current interpretations of fas  earnings per share  issuers of contingently convertible debt instruments exclude the potential common shares underlying the debt instrument from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the contingency is met 
eitf requires that potential shares underlying the debt instrument be included in diluted earnings per share computations  if dilutive  regardless of whether the contingency has been met 
we adopted eitf in december and retroactively adjusted all prior period diluted earnings per share amounts to conform to the guidance in eitf the adoption of eitf resulted in a decrease to diluted earnings per share of and in fiscal and  respectively 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies listed below that we believe are both most critical to our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition lottery and gaming transaction processing services we generally conduct our lottery and gaming business under two types of contractual arrangements facilities management contracts and product sales contracts 
facilities management contracts a majority of our revenues are derived from facilities management contracts  under which we construct  install  operate and retain ownership of the online lottery system lottery system 
these contracts generally provide for a variable amount of monthly or weekly service fees paid to us directly from the lottery authority based on a percentage of a lottery s gross online and instant ticket sales or a percentage of net machine income 
these fees are recognized as revenue in the period earned and are classified as service revenue in our consolidated income statements when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a customer contract has been signed services have been rendered our fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where customer acceptance of the product or system is required  revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met 
product sales contracts under product sales contracts  we construct  sell  deliver and install a turnkey lottery system or deliver lottery equipment  and license the computer software for a fixed price  and the lottery authority subsequently operates the lottery system 
product sale contracts generally include customer acceptance provisions and general customer rights to terminate the contract if we are in breach of the contract 
because product sales contracts include significant customization  modification and other services prior to customer acceptance that are considered essential to the lottery software inherent in our lottery systems  revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
under contract accounting  amounts due to us  and costs incurred by us in constructing the lottery system  prior to customer acceptance  are deferred 
revenue attributable to the lottery system is classified as sales of products in our consolidated income statements and is recognized upon customer acceptance as long as there are no substantial doubts regarding collectibility 
whenever we enter into a product sale contract that involves the delivery or performance of multiple products and services that include the development and customization of software  implementation services  and licensed software and support services  we apply the consensus of eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether the non customization related deliverables specified in the contract should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
if the elements qualify as separate units of accounting  and fair value exists for the elements of the contract that are unrelated to the customization services  these elements are accounted for separately  and the related revenue is recognized as the products are delivered or the services are rendered 
the application of revenue recognition principles requires judgment  including whether our product sales contracts include multiple elements  and if so  whether fair value exists for those elements 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  the relative fair value that should be allocated to each of the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
our interpretation would not affect the amount of revenue recognized but could impact the timing of revenue recognition 
revenues attributable to any ongoing services provided subsequent to customer acceptance are classified as service revenue in our consolidated income statements in the period earned 
in certain product sale contracts primarily the stand alone sale of lottery or video lottery terminals and software deliverables that do not involve significant customization of software  we are not responsible for installation 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a customer contract has been signed the product has been delivered our fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties collectibility is reasonably assured in instances where installation and or customer acceptance of the product is required  revenue is deferred until installation is complete and any acceptance criteria have been met 
our typical payment terms under product sale contracts include customer progress payments based on specific contract milestones with final payment due on or shortly after customer acceptance 
we do not generally offer our customers payment terms that extend substantially beyond customer acceptance 
in the rare case that we provide a customer with extended payment terms  we defer revenue equal to the amount of the extended payment until it is received 
non lottery transaction processing services we offer high volume transaction processing services outside of our core market of providing online lottery services that consist of the acquiring  processing and transmission of commercial non lottery transactions 
such transactions include retail debit  credit and charge card transactions  bill payments  electronic tax payments  utility payments  prepaid cellular telephone recharges and retail based programs 
we earn a fee for processing commercial non lottery transactions that is transaction based a fixed fee per transaction or a fee based on a percentage of dollar volume processed 
we recognize these fees as service revenue at the time a transaction is processed based on the net amount retained in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
deferred revenue and liquidated damage assessments amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are recorded in advance payments from customers in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record liquidated damage assessments  which are penalties incurred due to a failure to meet specified deadlines or performance standards  as a reduction of revenue in the period they become probable and estimable 
liquidated damage assessments equaled  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
income tax expense and accruals our annual income tax rate is based upon our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the result of a tax audit 
an estimated effective annual income tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time 
tax law requires items to be included in the income tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  our annual income tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our income tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our income tax return in future years for which we have recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a tax deduction or credit in that tax jurisdiction 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent income tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expense for which we have taken a deduction in our income tax return but have not yet recognized an expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states income tax expense on undistributed international earnings since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is ultimately resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular matter  we believe our reserves reflect the most probable outcome of known contingencies 
trade accounts receivable  net and sales type lease receivables we evaluate the collectibility of trade accounts and sales type lease receivables on a customer by customer basis and we believe our reserves are adequate  however  if economic circumstances change significantly resulting in a major customer s inability or unwillingness to meet its financial obligations to us  original estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by significant amounts requiring additional reserves 
inventories and obsolescence inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
inventories include amounts we manufacture or assemble for our long term service contracts  which are transferred to systems  equipment and other assets relating to contracts upon shipment 
inventories also include amounts related to product sales contracts  including product sales under long term contracts 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  should future sales forecasts change  our original estimates of obsolescence could increase by a significant amount requiring additional reserves 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate these assets may be impaired 
other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we review other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued if conditions exist that may indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include  among others  significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset 
because we have a single operating and reportable business segment the transaction processing segment  we perform our goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the transaction processing segment with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the transaction processing segment exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  a write down would be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets whenever indicators of impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include such items as declines in revenues  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the economic or political stability of a particular country  which may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable 
if facts and circumstances indicate our long lived assets may be impaired  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these long lived assets would be compared to their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value is necessary

the increase in international lottery service revenues includes higher service revenues from an increase in sales by our international lottery customers of approximately  along with favorable foreign exchange rates and higher jackpot activity  partially offset by lower revenues from brazil related to the court order to withhold of our revenues 
while we are not able to quantify precisely the reasons for increases in sales by our international lottery customers  we believe that in general  such increases are attributable to more rapid growth rates typical of newer lottery jurisdictions  the successful introduction of new games and modifications to existing games such as matrix changes and more frequent drawings

polcard is the leading debit and credit card merchant transaction acquirer and processor in poland 
wbs is a telecommunications provider in south africa 
in fiscal  we determined that we no longer had a controlling interest in wbs that would require consolidation in our financial statements due principally to the expiration of our guarantee of loans made by an unrelated commercial lender to wbs and we now account for wbs using the equity method of accounting 
the million one time  non cash  pre tax gain in the prior fiscal year resulted from the consolidation of the partnership that owns our world headquarters facilities  which was recorded in compliance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no

income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal  down from in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a larger percentage of international profits taxed at rates that are lower than the us statutory income tax rate and increased tax benefits relating to export sales 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
among its provisions  the act provides for a one time special deduction for certain qualifying dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
while we continue to evaluate the act  we do not plan to elect the one time special deduction because of the resulting loss of foreign tax credits and because the vast majority of our permanently reinvested non us earnings have been deployed in active non us business operations

liquidity  capital resources and financial position we believe our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths and we expect to meet our financial commitments and operating needs in the foreseeable future 
we expect to use cash generated from operating activities primarily for contractual obligations and to pay dividends 
we expect our growth to be financed through a combination of cash generated from operating activities  existing sources of liquidity  access to capital markets and other sources of capital 
our debt ratings of baa stable outlook from moody s and bbb stable outlook from standard and poor s contribute to our ability to access capital markets at attractive prices 
analysis of cash flows during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations 
this cash  along with cash generated by the sale of available for sale investment securities  was principally used to fund the spielo  lilhco and billbird acquisitions of million and to fund million of systems  equipment and other assets relating to contracts

we expect our principal sources of liquidity to be existing cash and short term investment securities balances  along with cash we generate from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving line of credit of million and matures in october there were no borrowings under the credit facility as of february  up to million of the credit facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit 
as of february   after considering million of letters of credit issued and outstanding  there was million available for borrowing under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains various covenants  including among other things  requirements relating to the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
none of these covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
there are no covenants in our credit facility that restrict our ability to pay dividends 
at february  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
we currently expect that our cash flow from operations  existing cash  available borrowings under our credit facility and access to additional sources of capital will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to fund our anticipated working capital and ordinary capital expenditure needs  to service our debt obligations  to fund anticipated internal growth  to fund all or a portion of the cash needed for potential acquisitions  to pay dividends  to fund the capital requirements under our master contract with the rhode island lottery and to repurchase shares of our common stock  from time to time  under our share repurchase programs 
we may also seek alternative sources of financing to fund certain of our obligations under our master contract with the rhode island lottery and to fund future potential acquisitions and growth opportunities that are not currently contemplated in the million to million we estimate we will need in fiscal for the uses disclosed above

acquisition of atronic in december  we entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling equity position in the atronic group of companies atronic owned by the owners of the privately held gauselmann group gauselmann 
the remaining of atronic will be retained by the owners of gauselmann 
atronic is a video slot machine manufacturer and develops slot machine games and customized solutions for dynamic gaming operations 
the final purchase price for atronic will be calculated through a performance based formula equal to eight times atronic s ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for its fiscal year ending december  in addition  in the months after the closing  atronic will also have the potential to receive an earn out amount based on its performance above specified thresholds 
we currently expect the all cash transaction will have a total value of approximately million to million  for our share  including the assumption of debt 
beginning in  we have the option to purchase gauselmann s interest in atronic and gauselmann has a reciprocal right to sell its interest to us at a value determined by independent appraisers 
there are also mutual put call rights that may become effective before  under certain circumstances 
the exercise price under these circumstances will be calculated through a performance based formula 
this transaction is contingent upon regulatory and gaming license approvals and other closing conditions  and is expected to be completed on december  option to purchase polcard outstanding equity in may  we completed the acquisition of a controlling equity position in polcard sa polcard  for a purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million 
polcard is the leading debit and credit card merchant transaction acquirer and processor in poland 
in august  polcard s outstanding equity was owned by us  by two funds managed by innova capital sp 
z oo innova  a warsaw based private equity investment advisor  and by the polish bank association  one of polcard s previous owners 
in september  innova exercised its rights under an option agreement to purchase from us  of polcard s equity for a purchase price of million 
following the exercise of this right  we now own of polcard s outstanding equity  while the two funds managed by innova own  in aggregate  of polcard s outstanding equity 
the polish bank association continues to own of the outstanding equity of polcard 
approval of this transaction by our shareholders was not required 
we have three fair value options to purchase innova s interest in polcard  and innova has the reciprocal right to sell its interest in polcard to us at fair value 
each fair value option has a duration of days and is to be based on an appraised value from at least two investment banks at the date of each option period 
we estimate that the buyout prices of each fair value option  based on discounted cash flows  could be as follows buyout percentage of the polcard range of exercise date commencing in outstanding equity buyout price may to million may to million may to million financial risk management and dividend policy financial risk management the primary market risk inherent in our financial instruments and exposures is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to commodity price changes is not considered material and is managed through our procurement and sales practices 
we use various techniques to manage our market risks  including from time to time  the use of derivative instruments 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into financial instruments with major  financially sound counterparties with high grade credit ratings and by limiting exposure to any one counterparty 
we do not engage in currency or interest rate speculation 
interest rate market risk interest rate market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of our total debt or current earnings resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt and change in the estimated fair value due to hypothetical changes in interest rates are as follows dollars in millions estimated fair value at february  increase in decrease in interest rates interest rates million of senior notes million of senior notes million of senior notes million of convertible debentures the estimated fair values above were determined by an independent investment banker 
the values of the senior notes were determined after taking into consideration million of interest rate swaps as follows estimated fair value debt fair interest rate value swaps outstanding million of senior notes million of senior notes million of senior notes a hypothetical adverse or favorable change in interest rates applied to variable rate debt would not have a material effect on current earnings 
we use various techniques to mitigate the risk associated with future changes in interest rates  including entering into interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements 
interest rate swap agreements during the third quarter of fiscal  in conjunction with the issuance of million of senior notes  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert million of our senior notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate for the period november to december and million of our senior notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate for the period november to december treasury rate lock agreements in the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into agreements to lock in interest rates to hedge against potential increases to interest rates prior to the issuance of our senior notes and senior notes 
we determined that the treasury rate lock agreements were highly effective and qualified for hedge accounting 
all treasury rate lock agreements have matured 
the related gains of million were deferred and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet at february  and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective debt instrument 
equity price risk the estimated fair value of our million of convertible debentures and change in the estimated fair value due to hypothetical changes in the market price of our common stock is as follows dollars in millions estimated fair value increase in decrease in at february  market price of market price of common stock common stock million of convertible debentures the estimated fair values above were determined by an independent investment banker and were based on a quoted market price of  per debenture 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  which is united states dollars  and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into united states dollar balance sheet accounts 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk by securing payment from our customers in united states dollars  by sharing risk with our customers  by utilizing foreign currency borrowings  by leading and lagging receipts and payments  and by entering into foreign currency exchange and option contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the costs attributable to our foreign currency revenues are payable in the local currencies 
in limited circumstances  but whenever possible  we negotiate clauses into our contracts that allow for price adjustments should a material change in foreign exchange rates occur 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce the exposure associated with certain firm commitments  variable service revenues and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  but we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
these contracts generally have maturities of months or less and are regularly renewed to provide continuing coverage throughout the year 
as of february   we had contracts for the sale of foreign currency of approximately million primarily euro and pounds sterling and the purchase of foreign currency of approximately million primarily brazilian real  pounds sterling  new taiwan dollars and canadian dollars 
comparatively  as of february   we had contracts for the sale of foreign currency of approximately million primarily euro and pounds sterling and the purchase of foreign currency of approximately million primarily brazilian real  pounds sterling  swedish krona  and new taiwan dollars 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a translation loss of million and million  respectively  that would be recorded in the equity section of our balance sheet 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net pre tax transaction loss of million and million  respectively  that would be recorded in current earnings after considering the effects of foreign exchange contracts currently in place 
at february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net reduction of cash flows from anticipatory transactions in fiscal of million  after considering the effects of foreign exchange contracts currently in place 
the percentage of fiscal and anticipatory cash flows that were hedged varied throughout each fiscal year  but averaged in fiscal compared to in fiscal dividend policy we are committed to returning value to our shareholders
