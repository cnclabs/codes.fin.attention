refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the corporation are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of the critical areas that required a higher degree of judgment or are considered complex 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the corporation evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the corporation is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations evidenced by such events as bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings  a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the corporation reasonably expects will be collected 
in addition  the corporation recognizes reserves for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs and current economic conditions 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although the corporation considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the retail markets in which the corporation operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
on march   the corporation adopted sfas sfas presumes that goodwill and certain intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
accordingly  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized  but subject to at least an annual review for impairment 
upon adoption  the corporation ceased amortization of goodwill and performs an impairment test annually 
to test for goodwill impairment  the corporation is required to estimate the fair market value of each of its reporting units 
the corporation estimates future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates 
changes to management s judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
the annual review for goodwill impairment was completed in the fourth quarter of and resulted in no impairment 
the retail operations segment is a reporting unit as defined by sfas and  as such  is the level that is tested for impairment of goodwill 
due primarily to declining results and cash flows in the past two years  the fair value of the retail operations segment and one international reporting unit  determined for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment  has declined 
as a result  corporate management is closely monitoring the short term performance of these businesses 
to enable this monitoring  the corporation has taken actions in these businesses to improve results of operations and cash flows  and established performance indicators within each of these businesses in order to assess the progress of the businesses throughout should either of these businesses fail to meet the established performance indicators  the goodwill in these businesses may require testing for impairment prior to the annual impairment test 
deferred costs in the normal course of its business  the corporation enters into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products 
the 
table of contents corporation views such agreements as advantageous in developing and maintaining business with its retail customers 
the customer typically receives a combination of cash payments  credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned as product is purchased from the corporation over the stated time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment 
these agreements are negotiated individually to meet competitive situations and therefore  while some aspects of the agreements may be similar  important contractual terms may vary 
in addition  the agreements may or may not specify the corporation as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer 
although risk is inherent in the granting of advances  the corporation subjects such customers to its normal credit review 
the corporation maintains a general reserve for deferred costs based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
in instances where the corporation is aware of a particular customer s inability to meet its performance obligation  the corporation records a specific reserve to reduce the deferred cost asset to an estimate of the value of future cash flows based upon expected performance 
the corporation maintains reserves for deferred costs related to these agreements of million and million at february  and february   respectively 
losses attributed to these specific events have historically not been material 
for contractual arrangements that are based upon a minimum purchase volume commitment  the corporation periodically reviews the progress toward the volume commitment and estimates future sales expectations for each customer 
factors that can affect the corporation s estimate include store door openings and closings  retail industry consolidation  amendments to the agreements  consumer shopping trends  addition or deletion of participating products and product productivity 
based upon its review  the corporation may modify the remaining amortization periods of individual agreements to reflect the changes in the estimates for the attainment of the minimum volume commitment in order to align amortization expense with the periods benefited 
the corporation does not make retroactive expense adjustments to prior fiscal years 
the aggregate average remaining life of the corporation s contract base is years 
the accuracy of the corporation s assessments of the performance related value of a deferred cost asset related to a particular agreement and of the estimated time period of the completion of a volume commitment is based upon management s ability to accurately predict certain key variables such as product demand at retail  product pricing  customer viability and other economic factors 
predicting these key variables involves uncertainty about future events  however  the assumptions used are consistent with the corporation s internal planning 
if the deferred cost assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to not be recoverable through performance  such assets are written down as appropriate
