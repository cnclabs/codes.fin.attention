table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of transaction services  credit services and marketing services in north america 
we focus on facilitating and managing electronic transactions between our clients and their customers 
we operate in three business segments transaction services  credit services and marketing services 
transaction services 
transaction services is our largest segment 
the transaction services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of statements generated  customer calls handled and transactions processed 
statements generated is the primary driver of revenue for this segment and represents the majority of revenue 
statements generated this driver represents the number of statements generated for our private label credit card and utility clients 
the number of statements generated in any given period is a fairly reliable indicator of the number of active accountholders during that period 
in addition to receiving payment for each statement generated  we also are paid for other services such as remittance processing  customer care and various marketing services 
transaction services primarily is affected by increased outsourcing in our targeted industry verticals 
companies are increasingly outsourcing their non core processes such as customer information systems  billing and customer care 
we are impacted by this trend with our clients in utility services and issuer services 
credit services 
the credit services segment primarily generates revenue from servicing fees from our securitization trusts  merchant discount fees  and securitization income 
private label credit sales and average securitized portfolio are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
private label credit sales this driver represents the dollar value of private label credit card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites 
we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our private label credit card program 
private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card banks 
average securitized portfolio this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders that have been securitized 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that drive the outstanding balances such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
generally we securitize our receivables  which results in a sale for accounting purposes and effectively removes them from our balance sheet to one of our securitization trusts 
credit services is affected by industry trends similar to transaction services 
the growing trend of outsourcing of private label credit card programs leads to increased accounts and balances to finance 
additionally  economic trends can impact this segment 
interest expense is a significant component of operating costs for our securitized trusts 
over the last three years we have experienced a historically low interest rate environment 
we have refinanced our recent bond maturities with instruments that lock in our effective interest rate for up to five year terms 
interest rates began to increase in as the economic environment has improved 
a low interest rate environment is usually indicative of a slower economic environment  which can negatively impact our net charge offs  a significant cost of financing receivables 
in the last five years  our net charge offs have increased from in to a peak of in as the economy slowed during that period 
we have been able to lower our net charge offs to our current rate of 
our expectation for is that we will experience similar levels of net charge offs and cost of funds as we experienced during marketing services 
marketing services has historically been represented primarily by our air miles reward program  which we believe to be the largest coalition loyalty program in canada 
we 
table of contents primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and in limited circumstances the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment  and as a result they are both indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued depends upon the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represents future revenue and earnings for us 
air miles reward miles redeemed a majority of the revenue we recognize in this segment is derived from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
redemptions also show that collectors are attaining the rewards that are offered through our programs 
our air miles reward program tends not to be significantly impacted by economic swings as the majority of the sponsors are in non discretionary categories such as grocery  petroleum and financial institutions 
additionally  we target the sponsor s most loyal customers  who are unlikely to change their spending patterns 
we are impacted by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar appreciated this year  which benefited our operating results 
our expectation is that the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate will be more stable in than in and remain at its current relative levels 
additionally in  we expect to show a significant increase in database marketing fees as a result of the acquisition of epsilon in the fourth quarter of year in review highlights our results of operations were largely impacted by new and renewed agreements with significant clients  three capital market transactions and continued selective execution of our acquisition strategy 
during  we signed or renewed agreements with several significant clients and sponsors in january  we signed a long term renewal with bmo bank of montreal mastercard  a top five client and founding sponsor in the air miles reward program

additionally  during  we completed three significant capital market transactions in may  we completed the sale of million in asset backed notes for our securitization trusts 
in september  we completed the sale of million in asset backed notes for our securitization trusts 
in october  we entered into amendments to our three credit facilities 
collectively  the three amendments increased the aggregate amount of revolving commitments under the three credit facilities from million to million  since adjusted to million 
in addition  the amendments increased the aggregate amount of commitments permitted under the three credit facilities from million to million 
discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
securitization of credit card receivables 
we utilize a securitization program to finance substantially all of the credit card receivables that we underwrite 
our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis 
we use our off balance sheet securitization program to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital 
in a securitization transaction  we sell credit card receivables originated by our credit services segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables  an 
table of contents equity interest in the trust  and an interest in the receivables 
the securitization trusts are deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and are appropriately not included in our consolidated financial statements 
our interest in the trusts is represented on our consolidated balance sheets as seller s interest our interest in the receivables and due from securitizations our retained interests and credit enhancement components 
in turn  the trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions 
the proceeds from the debt are used to fund the receivables  while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs 
the excess spread is remitted to us as securitization income 
our retained interest  often referred to as an interest only strip  is recorded at fair value 
our interest only strip has historically been valued between and of average securitized receivables 
the fair value of our interest only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we have retained over the estimated outstanding period of the receivables 
this anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond holders  estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses 
because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets  we estimated the fair value of the interest only strip primarily based upon discount  payment and default rates  which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest only strip 
the estimated market assumptions are applied based upon the underlying loan portfolio grouped by loan types  terms  credit quality  interest rates and geographic location  which are the predominant characteristics that affect payment and default rates 
changes in the fair value of the interest only strip are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark to market changes 
in recording and accounting for interest only strips  we made assumptions about rates of payments and defaults that we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value 
due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions  the actual rates of payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates  and these differences could sometimes be material 
if actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed  the value of the interest only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value recorded in earnings 
further sensitivity information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components based on the relative fair value of the related element redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or  for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the total amount of deferred revenue related to the redemption element is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue redemption 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the total amount of deferred revenue related to the service element is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue service 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption 
under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 

table of contents the amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile of months and breakage of one third has remained constant over the past five years 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage is actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
we believe that the issuance and redemption of air miles reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors  the type of rewards offered  the overall health of the canadian economy  the nature and extent of air miles promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs 
these influences will primarily affect the average life of an air miles reward mile 
we do not believe that the estimated life will vary significantly over time  consistent with historical trends 
the shortening of the life of an air miles reward mile will accelerate the recognition of revenue and may affect the breakage rate 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue related to the air miles reward program that will be recognized in the future 
further information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inter segment sales our transaction services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to our credit services segment 
for this  our transaction services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin 
the margin is based on current market rates for similar services 
this fee represents an operating cost to the credit services segment and a corresponding revenue for our transaction services segment 
inter segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation 
revenues earned by our transaction services segment from servicing our credit services segment  and consequently paid by our credit services segment to our transaction services segment  are set forth opposite other eliminations in the tables presented in the annual comparisons in our results of operations 

table of contents use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to net loss income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus stock compensation expense  provision for income taxes  interest expense  net  fair value loss on interest rate derivative  other expenses  depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles 
operating ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to adjusted ebitda plus the change in deferred revenue less the change in redemption settlement assets 
we have presented operating ebitda because we use the financial measure as part of our monitoring of compliance with the financial covenants in our credit facilities 
for  senior debt to operating ebitda was x compared to a maximum ratio of x and operating ebitda to interest expense was x compared to a minimum ratio of x 
our covenant ratios for will be the same as for as discussed in more detail in the liquidity section of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our credit facilities together with cash flow from operations are the two main sources of funding for our acquisition strategy and for our future working capital needs and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under these credit facilities and had approximately million in unused borrowing capacity 
we were in compliance with our covenants at december  and we expect to be in compliance with these covenants during the year ending december  we use adjusted ebitda as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management 
adjusted ebitda is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets  the impact of related impairments  as well as asset sales through other financial measures  such as capital expenditures  investment spending and return on capital 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the non cash effect of stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted ebitda provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations 
therefore  we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations 
adjusted ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  adjusted ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap

table of contents delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
it is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts  except in limited circumstances  until the account balance and all related interest and other fees are charged off or paid  beyond days delinquent 
when an account becomes delinquent  we print a message on the cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house efforts  we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 
the following table presents the delinquency trends of our securitized credit card portfolio december  of december  of total total dollars in thousands receivables outstanding receivables balances contractually delinquent to days to days or more days total net charge offs 
net charge offs comprise the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances  as well as bankrupt and deceased cardholders  less current period recoveries 
net charge offs exclude accrued finance charges and fees

during late and early  we purchased several credit card portfolios that were sold to our securitization trusts in the second quarter of merchant settlement activity is driven by the number of days of float at the end of the period 
for these purposes  float means the difference between the number of days we hold cash before remitting the cash to our merchants and the number of days the card associations hold cash before remitting the cash to us 
merchant settlement activity fluctuates significantly depending on the day in which the period ends 
we generated cash flow from operating activities before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in the increase in operating cash flows before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity is primarily related to the increased earnings of the company 
we utilize our cash flow from operations for ongoing business operations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
investing activities 
we use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we utilized cash flow for investing activities of million for the year ended 
table of contents december  compared to million for the comparable period in significant components of investing activities are as follows acquisitions 
we acquired epsilon data management  inc and capstone consulting partners  inc  each in a cash for common stock transaction  for approximately million compared to acquisitions totaling million in payments to secure customer processing relationship 
during march  we entered into an agreement with centrica plc and american electric power to provide billing and customer care services to over  accounts in the texas marketplace 
as part of this agreement  we paid approximately million for the contract and back office operations 
securitizations and receivables funding 
we generally fund all private label credit card receivables through a securitization program that provides us with both liquidity and lower borrowing costs 
as of december   we had over billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread accounts and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is funded through the use of certificates of deposit issued through our subsidiary  world financial network national bank 
net securitization activity utilized million for the year ended december  compared to million in we intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the prior year 
this is consistent with our normal level of capital expenditures 
we have no expectation that this will change in the foreseeable future 
financing activities 
our cash flows provided by financing activities were million in compared to million used in financing activities in our financing activities for relate to borrowings and repayments of debt in the normal course of business  million in borrowings for the purchase of epsilon and the exercise of stock options 
liquidity sources 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have four main sources of liquidity our securitization program  certificates of deposit issued by world financial network national bank  our credit facilities  and issuances of equity securities 
we believe that internally generated funds and existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet current and anticipated financing requirements during the next months 
securitization program and off balance sheet transactions 
since january  we have sold  sometimes through wfn credit company  llc and wfn funding company ii  llc  substantially all of the credit card receivables owned by our credit card bank  world financial network national bank  to the wfn trusts as part of our securitization program 
this securitization program is the primary vehicle through which we finance our private label credit card receivables 
the following table shows expected maturities for borrowing commitments of the wfn trusts under our securitization program by year thereafter total in thousands public notes private conduits total represents borrowing capacity  not outstanding borrowings

world financial network credit card master note trust entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rates on the notes starting at and averaging over the five year term of the interest rate swap 
as public notes approach maturity  the notes will enter a controlled accumulation period  which typically lasts three months 
during the controlled accumulation period  we will either need to arrange an additional private conduit facility or use our own balance sheet to finance the controlled accumulation until such time as we can issue a new public series in the public markets 
we continue to utilize private conduits as a source of funding  including while our public asset backed transactions are being completed 
a private conduit facility was put in place to fund the accumulation of the a notes that matured in august to replace this conduit  world financial network credit card master note trust completed a million offering of asset backed notes issued in multiple offerings as follows in september  world financial network credit card master note trust issued million of class a series b asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one month libor plus per year and that will mature in september  million of class m series b asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one month libor plus per year and that will mature in september  million of class b series b asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one month libor plus per year and that will mature in september and million of class c series b asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one month libor plus per year and that will mature in september the notes are rated aaa through bbb  or its equivalent  by each of standard and poor s  moody s  and fitch

world financial network credit card master note trust entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rates on the notes starting at and averaging over the seven year term of the interest rate swap 
as of december   the wfn trusts had over billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread deposits and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the wfn trusts and by the performance of the private label credit cards in the securitization trust 
during the period from november to january  the wfn trusts are required to maintain a credit enhancement level of between and of securitized credit card receivables 
certain of the wfn trusts are required to maintain a level of between and for the remainder of the year 
accordingly  at december  the wfn trusts typically have their highest balance of credit enhancement assets as a result of the increased balances during the holiday season 
we intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future 

table of contents if world financial network national bank were not able to regularly securitize the receivables it originates  our ability to grow or even maintain our credit services business would be materially impaired as we would be severely limited in our financing ability 
world financial network national bank s ability to effect securitization transactions is impacted by the following factors  some of which are beyond our control conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset backed securitization market in particular  and conformity in the quality of credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in those requirements  and our ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements  which we routinely utilize in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower our borrowing costs 
we believe that the conditions to securitize private label credit card receivables are favorable for us 
we plan to continue using our securitization program as our primary financing vehicle 
once world financial network national bank securitizes receivables  the agreement governing the transaction contains covenants that address the receivables performance and the continued solvency of the retailer where the underlying sales were generated 
in the event one of those or other similar covenants is breached  an early amortization event could be declared  in which case the trustee for the securitization trust would retain world financial network national bank s interest in the related receivables  along with the excess interest income that would normally be paid to world financial network national bank  until such time as the securitization investors are fully repaid 
the occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit  or even negate  our ability to securitize additional receivables 
certificates of deposit 
we utilize certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities of our credit card bank subsidiary  world financial network national bank  and to fund securitization enhancement requirements 
world financial network national bank issues certificates of deposit in denominations of  in various maturities ranging between three months and two years  with current effective annual fixed rates ranging from to 
as of december   we had million of certificates of deposit outstanding 
certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
credit facilities 
on april   we entered into three credit facilities to replace our prior credit facilities 
the first facility matures in april  the second facility is a day facility that  as amended as of april   matures in april  and the third facility  under which the borrower is loyalty management group canada inc  a wholly owned canadian subsidiary  matures in april the covenants contained in the three credit facilities are substantially identical 
we were in compliance with our covenants at december  on october   we entered into amendments to our three credit facilities 
collectively  the three amendments increased the aggregate amount of revolving commitments under the three credit facilities from million to million since adjusted to million 
the amendment to the year credit facility increased the amount of revolving commitments thereunder from million to million 
the amendment to the day credit facility increased the amount of revolving commitments thereunder from million to million  which has since been adjusted to million 
the amendment to the canadian credit facility decreased the amount of revolving commitments thereunder from million to million 
in addition  the amendments increased the aggregate amount of commitments permitted under the three credit facilities from million to million 
as a result  we have the right to obtain commitments under the three credit facilities for an additional million in the aggregate without having to amend the credit facilities 
except as described above  the remaining terms of each credit facility remain unchanged 
advances under the credit facilities are in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
the interest rate on base rate loans fluctuates based upon the higher of the interest rate announced by the 
table of contents administrative agent as its prime rate and the federal funds rate plus  in each case with no additional margin 
the interest rate on eurodollar loans fluctuates based upon the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market are quoted plus a margin of to based upon the ratio of total debt under the credit facilities to consolidated operating ebitda  as each term is defined in the credit facilities 
the credit facilities are secured by pledges of stock of certain of our subsidiaries and pledges of certain intercompany promissory notes 
at december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under these credit facilities with an average interest rate of  we issued no letters of credit  and we had available unused borrowing capacity of approximately million 
the credit facilities limit our aggregate outstanding letters of credit to million 
we can obtain an increase in the total commitment under the credit facilities of up to million if we are not in default under the credit facilities  one or more lenders agrees to increase its commitment and the administrative agent consents 
we utilize our credit facilities and excess cash flows from operations to support our acquisition strategy and to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
the epsilon acquisition was funded in part by million drawn on our credit facilities 
issuances of equity securities 
in april  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
limited commerce corp 
sold  of those shares and the remaining  shares were sold by us 
the net proceeds to us from the offering were million after deducting offering expenses and our pro rata underwriting discounts and commissions 
concurrently with the closing of the public offering  we used million of the net proceeds to repay in full million of debt outstanding  plus accrued interest  under a subordinated note that we issued in september to an affiliated entity of welsh carson 
in november  we facilitated a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
 shares were sold by limited commerce corp 
and the remaining  shares were sold by welsh carson through two of its affiliated entities 
we sold no stock and received none of the proceeds from the secondary offering 
in connection with the secondary offering  we incurred approximately  in registration costs  which were expensed in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the secondary offering  limited commerce corp 
is no longer a stockholder 
contractual obligations 
the following table highlights  as of december   our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period thereafter total dollars in thousands certificates of deposit credit facilities operating leases capital leases software licenses purchase obligations the table does not include an estimate for income taxes that we are required to pay  but are not required to include above

interest was based on the interest rates in effect as of december   applied to the contractual repayment period 
purchase obligations include purchase commitments under our air miles reward program  minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services 

table of contents we believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments 
economic fluctuations although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation 
for the most part  we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology  as well as decreases in technology and communication costs  to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
portions of our business are seasonal 
our revenues and earnings are favorably affected by increased transaction volume and credit card balances during the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down 
similarly  our petroleum related businesses are favorably affected by increased volume in the latter part of the second quarter and the first part of the third quarter as consumers make more frequent purchases of gasoline in connection with summer travel

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include off balance sheet risk  interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
off balance sheet risk 
we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  including commitments to extend credit and through our securitization program 
we sell substantially all of our credit card receivables to the wfn trusts  qualifying special purpose entities 
the trusts enter into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions 
the securitization program involves elements of credit  market  interest rate  legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest only strips 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total interest incurred was approximately million for  which includes both on and off balance sheet transactions 
of this total  million of the interest expense  net for was attributable to on balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables  which are financed off balance sheet 
to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on and off balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
an additional of our securitization trusts debt at december  was locked at an effective interest rate of through interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks with notional amounts totaling billion 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pretax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in an annual decrease to pretax income of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase to pretax income 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
we have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters 
to minimize our risk of loan write offs  we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices 
we monitor the buying limits  as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
we do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary 

table of contents redemption reward risk 
through our air miles reward program  we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards 
to minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs  we have multi year supply agreements with several canadian  us and international airlines  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards  which are typically lower cost per air miles reward mile than air travel  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using air miles reward miles alone  and periodically adjust the number of air miles reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward
