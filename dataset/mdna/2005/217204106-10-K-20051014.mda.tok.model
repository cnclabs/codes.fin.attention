overview we provide vehicle suppliers  primarily insurance companies  with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation vb internet auction style sales technology 
we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers  rebuilders  repair licensees  used vehicle dealers and exporters 
salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 
we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs 
we generate revenues primarily from fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage 
we process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method  on either the percentage incentive program pip or on a fixed fee consignment basis 
using either consignment method  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and of the vehicles we sold  respectively  were processed under pip 
we attempt to convert vehicle supplier agreements at acquired operations to pip  which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs 
those vehicles not sold under the pip program were processed under fixed fee agreements 
due to a number of factors  including the timing and size of new acquisitions  market conditions  and acceptance of pip by vehicle suppliers  the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs in future periods may vary 
our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues 
salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include sales fees under pip agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing  special preparation  storage and selling 
salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our sales for vehicles processed that we own 
costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  fleet maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management  accounting  data processing  sales personnel  human resources  professional fees  research and development and marketing expenses 
during fiscal  we converted all of our salvage vehicle storage and sales facilities to an internet based auction style model using our vb internet sales technology 
this second generation technology combines two bidding processes 
an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview days or over the internet 
to improve the effectiveness of bidding  the vb system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase 
the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format 
buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and bidu will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf 
preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internet only virtual sale 
bidu will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internet only virtual sale 
this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder 
the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format 
bidu submits bids for the high preliminary bidder  up to their maximum bid 
when bidding stops  a countdown is initiated 
if no bids are received during the countdown  the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 
vb opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access 
we believe the implementation of vb across our salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for salvage from us 
it has also improved the efficiency of our operations 
for fiscal  sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for of total vehicles sold  of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and were sold to buyers out of country 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions  new openings  weather and product introductions during such periods 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired twelve vehicle storage facilities and established eleven new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
as part of this strategy  in fiscal we acquired new facilities in or near lexington  kentucky and columbia  missouri and opened new facilities in strongsville  ohio  ocala  florida  knoxville  tennessee  loganville  georgia  spokane  washington  tallahassee  florida and hialeah  florida 
in fiscal we acquired new facilities in or near eugene  oregon  cleveland  ohio and anchorage  alaska and opened new facilities in or near toronto  canada and helena  montana 
in fiscal  we acquired new facilities in or near pittsburgh  pennsylvania  reno  nevada and richmond  virginia and opened new facilities in or near springfield  missouri  corpus christi  texas  ft 
pierce  florida  rancho cucamonga  california  richmond  virginia and albany  new york 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america and are able to provide national coverage for our suppliers 
we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers  iv increasing revenue and profitability at our public automobile sales facilities and v expanding the application of vb into new markets 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  income taxes  long lived assets and self insured liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer 
these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery  loading  title processing  preparation and storage 
we evaluate multiple element arrangements relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which addresses accounting for multiple element arrangements  and staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  which addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting 
the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller s behalf and under most of our current contracts  collecting the proceeds from the buyer 
we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and  accordingly  we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection 
in certain cases  seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer 
however  we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items 
as a result  we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered  which occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller 
we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle  charging a separate fee for each service 
each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of eitf to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multi element arrangement 
we have concluded that the auction service and the post auction services are separate units of accounting 
the fees for the auction service are recognized upon completion of the auction  and the fees for the post auction services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 
we also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program  which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  and relist and late payment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer 
no provision for returns has been established  as all sales are final with no right of return  although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non performance by our sellers 
vehicle pooling costs we defer  in vehicle pooling costs  certain yard and fleet expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard and fleet expenses of the period 
the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs  labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change  then yard and fleet expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles we evaluate separately the impairment of goodwill of our salvage and our public sales operating segments  annually by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value 
in prior years  we evaluated impairment of goodwill at the facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
during fiscal  when we centralized the sales process with the implementation of vb  we determined the appropriate level for testing for impairment was at the salvage and public sales levels 
under this accounting policy  we have not recognized any charges for the impairment of goodwill in previous years or the current year 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an operating segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring further impairment charges in the future 
deferred tax assets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance when  in certain taxable jurisdictions  the utilization of the tax asset is uncertain 
additional timing differences and future tax losses may occur which could warrant a need for establishing additional valuation allowances or reserves against certain deferred tax assets 
we are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions 
such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
long lived asset valuation we evaluate long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 
retained insurance liabilities we are partially self insured for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and auto liability 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenues 
there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 
fiscal years ended july  revenues operating expenses yard and fleet general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased vehicle sales volume  on which fees are generated and higher fees resulting from increased sales proceeds per vehicle 
the increase in gross proceeds per vehicle the gross sales price of the vehicle yields higher revenue per car as buyer fees and certain fees  including those sold under the pip program  are based on the gross proceeds per vehicle and generally increase as gross proceeds per vehicle grow 
we believe the increase in proceeds per vehicle was the result of the introduction of virtual bidding second generation vb as more buyers are able to participate in the sales 
existing facilities contributed approximately million of the revenue growth and new facilities in or near strongsville  ohio  ocala  florida  knoxville  tennessee  lexington  kentucky  loganville  georgia  spokane  washington  tallahassee  florida  hialeah  florida and columbia  missouri contributed approximately million of new revenue 
historically  we recorded revenue for most seller and buyer fees upon completion of a sale 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an immaterial correction of an error to account for our services in accordance with the policy above  the effect of which was to reduce revenue  net income and diluted earnings per share by million  million and  respectively for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended july  yard and fleet expenses were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities 
approximately million of the increase was the result of the acquisition and opening of new facilities 
yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities  grew by approximately million  or 
yard and fleet expenses decreased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal due in part to the fixed cost nature of our business 
yard and fleet expenses in fiscal included a net adjustment to insurance reserves and sales taxes that decreased this expense by million 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in software development cost  technology hardware leasing cost  and it payroll costs  all directly associated with the development and deployment of vb in addition  the company saw increases in the cost of professional services  impacted by sarbanes oxley compliance and increased payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues during fiscal and total other income was approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or from fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income of approximately million due to higher interest rates and a higher cash balance 
gain on the sale of fleet equipment decreased approximately million as we sold the majority of the fleet in fiscal in connection with our decision to subcontract towing services 
other income  which consists primarily of rental income  increased approximately million as we continued the rental of primarily unutilized areas within our facilities 
our effective combined federal  state and local income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in rate is attributable to an overall lower state tax rate  as we made certain revisions to our transfer pricing methodology and the beneficial impact of the growth in interest income which is predominantly federal tax exempt 
we do not expect significant changes to our effective tax rate in fiscal due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased salvage vehicle volume  new service revenue and higher fees resulting from increased sales proceeds per vehicle 
we believe the increase in proceeds per vehicle was the result of the introduction of virtual bidding second generation vb as more buyers are able to participate in the sales 
existing facilities contributed approximately million of new revenue and new facilities in or near toronto  canada  eugene  oregon  helena  montana  cleveland  ohio and anchorage  alaska contributed approximately million of new revenue 
yard and fleet expenses were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in yard and fleet expense is a net adjustment to insurance reserves that decreased this expense by million 
the increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities 
approximately million of the increase was the result of the acquisition and opening of new facilities 
depreciation and amortization expense associated with yard activities increased approximately million over fiscal this increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new storage and sales facilities 
yard and fleet expenses decreased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal yard and fleet expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue and was due in part to the fixed cost nature of our business 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in software development cost  technology hardware leasing cost  and it payroll costs  all directly associated with the development and deployment of vb in addition  the company saw increases in the cost of professional services  impacted by sarbanes oxley compliance and increased payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount 
general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal total other income was approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or from fiscal gain on sale of fleet equipment represents the gain on the sale of vehicles 
the sale of the equipment is associated with our decision to replace company owned trucks with subhaulers for towing services 
interest income decreased approximately million due to lower interest rates during the first nine months of the fiscal year 
other income  which consists primarily of rental income  increased approximately million as we rented several under utilized facilities 
our effective combined federal  state and local income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was approximately 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations  public offerings of common stock  equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing 
cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  mainly as a result of the conversion of million in short term investments in fiscal and changes in operating activities 
our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially affected by inflation 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this seasonal volume growth requires increased cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
we invest substantially all of our cash balances in aaa rated auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are principally variable rate securities tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days 
auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at predetermined short term intervals  usually every  or days 
they trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer 
interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction 
although these instruments are issued and rated as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term securities because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset 
these auction rate securities were converted to cash prior to the end of the current fiscal year and were held in money market accounts 
our primary source of cash is from the collection of sellers fees and buyers fees from the sale of salvage vehicles 
we believe that our currently available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the profitability of the company offset by routine changes in working capital 
investing activities during the fiscal year ended july   we purchased approximately million in short term investments 
these purchases were offset by the sale of million of short term investments 
we typically invest our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa  which were converted to cash prior to the end of the fiscal year 
capital expenditures excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures have related primarily to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment 
in addition  in fiscal  the company sold most of its transportation fleet as it moved to outsource this function 
sale of fleet equipment generated approximately million in gross proceeds 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used cash for the acquisition of operations in lexington  kentucky and columbia  missouri  which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used cash for the acquisition of operations in eugene  oregon  cleveland  ohio and anchorage  alaska  which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used cash for the acquisition of operations in west mifflin  pennsylvania  reno  nevada and richmond  virginia  which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately million 
financing activities in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase program 
in february  the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock 
the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program 
the repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts  as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time 
for the year ended july   we did not repurchase any shares 
as of july   we repurchased a total of  shares at a weighted average price of 
for the year ended july   we repurchased a total of  shares at a weighted average price of per share 
we accounted for the repurchase of our common stock by charging common stock for million 
through october   we have not repurchased any shares 
lease  purchase and other contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years letters of credit contractual obligations consist of future minimum lease payments under operating leases  including off balance sheet leases  used in the normal course of business 
commercial commitments include primarily letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions 
credit facilities on february   we entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate 
the facility provided by wells fargo bank  fleet national bank and us bank national association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of million that matures in as of july   we had available million under this facility  after taking into account million of outstanding letters of credit 
we are subject to customary covenants  including the following financial covenants ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  profitable operation  leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio 
we are in compliance with all covenants at july  recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas shall be applied prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas the accounting required by sfas r is similar to that of sfas  however  the choice between recognizing the fair value of stock options in the income statement or disclosing the pro forma income statement effect of the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements allowed under sfas has been eliminated in sfas r 
sfas r is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june   and early adoption is permitted 
management intends to use the modified prospective transition method to adopt sfas r beginning in fiscal and expects that the implementation of sfas r will increase our stock based compensation expense in fiscal in may  the fasb issued sfas no

and fasb statement no 

this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  management currently believes that adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate and foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
as of july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
during the course of the year we invested substantially all of our cash balances in aaa rated auction rate securities  which also bear interest at a variable rate 
due to the average maturity and nature of the company s investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are variable  a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 
our exposure to foreign currency risks relates to our operations in canada  which have not been significant 
we do not hedge our exposure to the canadian dollar 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
