item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order overview discussion of operating results liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements impact of inflation 
table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates factors that may affect future results and other cautionary statements overview our business operates in four geographic segments comprised of europe  the americas  asia pacific and africa and in each of these geographic segments our principal sources of income include airfreight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  customs brokerage  contract logistics and other supply chain management services 
our recent growth in gross revenue and net revenue for the years ended january  which we refer to as fiscal and january  which we refer to as fiscal  compared to the respective prior year period  resulted from growth which we attribute to the growth of our existing operations  our acquisitions made during the year and favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
the growth in our existing operations is attributable to serving new clients as well as the increase in business from existing clients  which we refer to as organic growth 
a significant portion of our expenses is variable and adjusts to reflect the level of our business activities 
other than transportation costs  staff costs are our single largest variable expense and are less flexible in the near term as we must staff to meet uncertain future demand 
in february  we initiated a five year strategic operating plan which we named nextleap 
nextleap is our plan to move uti worldwide from being a global freight forwarding operator to a company that can offer our customers a comprehensive and integrated range of services across the entire supply chain 
nextleap is a process of expanding and integrating our relationship with our customers and increasing the range of services we offer and provide for our customers  and thus cannot be measured in terms of percentage implemented 
under nextleap  we are undertaking various efforts to attempt to increase our customers and revenue  improve our operating margins  and train and develop our employees 
as of january   we have completed twelve of the twenty quarters covered by nextleap 
we face numerous challenges in trying to achieve our objectives under this strategic plan  including challenges involving attempts to leverage customer relationships  improve margins  integrate acquisitions and improve our systems 
we also face challenges developing  training and recruiting personnel 
this strategic operating plan requires that we successfully manage our operations and growth which we may not be able to do as well as we anticipate 
our industry is extremely competitive and our business is subject to numerous factors beyond our control 
we may not be able to successfully implement nextleap  and no assurances can be given that our efforts will result in increased revenues  improved margins or profitability 
if we are not able to increase our revenues and improve our operating margins in the future under nextleap  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
effect of foreign currency translation on comparison of results our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  due to our global operations  we conduct and will continue to conduct business in currencies other than our reporting currency 
the conversion of these currencies into our reporting currency for reporting purposes will be affected by movements in these currencies against the us dollar 
a depreciation of these currencies against the us dollar would result in lower gross and net revenues reported  however as applicable costs are also converted from these currencies  costs would also be lower 
similarly  the opposite effect will occur if these currencies appreciate against the us dollar 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency 
as such  when the values of those assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact the net book value of our assets 
we cannot predict the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
description of services revenue recognition airfreight forwarding 
when we act as an airfreight forwarder  we conduct business as an indirect carrier or occasionally as an authorized agent for the airline which carries the shipment 
in both cases  gross revenue and applicable costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin 

table of contents when we act as an indirect air carrier  we procure shipments from a large number of customers  consolidate shipments bound for a particular destination from a common place of origin  determine the routing over which the consolidated shipment will move  and purchase cargo space from airlines on a volume basis 
as an indirect air carrier  our gross revenue includes the rate charged to the client for the movement of the shipment on the airline  plus the fees we charge for our other ancillary services such as preparing shipment related documentation and materials handling related services 
airfreight forwarding gross revenue includes expedited movement by ground transportation and our domestic delivery service in south africa 
when we act as an indirect air carrier  our net revenue is the differential between the rates charged to us by the airlines and  where applicable  expedited ground transport operators  and the rates we charge our customers plus the fees we receive for our other services 
therefore  our net revenue is influenced by our ability to charge our customers a rate which is higher than the rate we obtain from the airlines  but which is also lower than the rate the customers could otherwise obtain directly from the airlines 
when we act as an authorized agent for the airline which carries the actual shipment  our gross revenue is primarily derived from commissions received from the airline plus fees for the ancillary services we provide  such as preparing shipment related documentation and materials handling related services 
our gross revenue does not include airline transportation costs when we act as an authorized agent 
accordingly  our gross revenue and net revenue are not materially different in this situation 
ocean freight forwarding 
when we act as an ocean freight forwarder  we conduct business as an indirect ocean carrier or occasionally as an authorized agent for the ocean carrier which carries the shipment 
our gross revenue and net revenue from ocean freight forwarding and related costs are recognized the same way that our gross revenue and net revenue from airfreight forwarding and related costs are recognized 
when we act as an indirect ocean carrier or non vessel operating common carriers  we contract with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points in a specified time period at an agreed upon rate 
we then solicit freight from customers to fill the containers and consolidate the freight bound for a particular destination from a common shipping point 
as in the case when we act as an indirect airfreight forwarder  our gross revenue in this situation includes the rate charged to the customer for the movement of the shipment on the ocean carrier plus our fees for the other services we provide which are related to the movement of goods such as preparing shipment related documentation 
our net revenue is determined by the differential between the rates charged to us by the carriers and the rates we charge our customers along with the fees we receive for our other ancillary services 
when we act as an authorized agent for an ocean carrier  our gross revenue is generated from the commission we receive from the carrier plus the fees we charge for the ancillary services we provide 
our gross revenue does not include transportation costs when we act as an authorized agent for an ocean carrier 
under these circumstances  our gross revenue and net revenue are not materially different 
customs brokerage 
we provide customs clearance and brokerage services with respect to the majority of the shipments we handle as a freight forwarder 
we also provide customs brokerage services for shipments handled by our competitors 
these services include assisting with and performing regulatory compliance functions in international trade 
customs brokerage gross revenue is recognized when the necessary documentation for customs clearance has been completed 
this gross revenue is generated by the fees we charge for providing customs brokerage services  as well as the fees we charge for the disbursements made on behalf of a customer 
these disbursements  which typically include customs duties and taxes  are excluded from our calculations of gross revenue since they represent disbursements made on behalf of customers 
typically  disbursements are included in our accounts receivable and are several times larger than the amount of customs brokerage gross revenue generated 
contract logistics 
our contract logistics services primarily relate to our value added warehousing services and distribution of goods and materials in order to meet customers inventory needs and production or distribution schedules 
our distribution services include receiving  deconsolidation and decontainerization  sorting  put away  consolidation  assembly  cargo loading and unloading  assembly of freight and protective 
table of contents packaging  storage and distribution 
our outsourced services include inspection services  quality centers and manufacturing support 
contract logistics gross revenue is recognized when the service has been provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business and net revenue excludes transportation costs incurred in providing contract logistics services 
we have expanded our contract logistics services with our acquisitions of ihd and unigistix in fiscal  uti integrated logistics in fiscal and sli in fiscal other services 
we also provide a range of other supply chain management services  such as road transportation  warehousing services  consulting  order management  planning and optimization services  outsourced distribution services  developing specialized customer specific supply chain solutions  and customized distribution and inventory management services 
our gross revenue in these capacities includes commissions and fees earned by us and are recognized upon performance 
acquisitions acquisitions affect the comparison of our results between years prior to when acquisitions are made and to subsequent years  depending on the date of acquisition ie  acquisitions made on february  the first day of our fiscal year  will only affect a comparison with the prior year s results 
the results of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of their respective acquisitions 
we consider the operating results of an acquired company during the first twelve months following the date of its acquisition to be an acquisition impact or a benefit from acquisitions 
thereafter  we consider the growth in an acquired company s results to be organic growth 
during the fiscal  we completed two acquisitions which have had a significant impact on the comparison of our operating results  increasing gross revenues  net revenues and expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal we also completed several smaller acquisitions during fiscal effective october   we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of unigistix  a canadian corporation which serves customers in the telecommunications  apparel  pharmaceuticals and healthcare sectors with integrated e commerce based logistics solutions 
the initial purchase price was approximately million in cash 
in addition to the initial payment  the terms of the acquisition agreement provide for two additional payments of up to approximately million contingent upon the anticipated future growth of unigistix over the each of the two twelve month periods ending october  the final purchase price allocation has not yet been determined as the company is still in the process of determining the final valuation of the intangible assets 
effective june   we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of ihd  a south african corporation  through a partnership we formed  of which we owned as of october  effective november   we sold of the partnership to a south african black economic empowerment organization for fair market value which approximated a share of the cost of the acquisition 
the purchase price for ihd was approximately million in cash 
ihd provides logistics and warehousing support and distribution services of pharmaceutical products throughout southern africa directly to end dispensers as well as to wholesalers 
effective february   we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of et logistics and ilex  both of which are spanish corporations which provide logistics services 
in addition to the initial cash purchase price for et logistics  there are four contingent earn out payments which will be calculated based on a multiple of the acquired operation s future earnings for each of the four fiscal years in the period ending january  in accordance with the modified purchase agreement dated november  we also acquired an additional of the issued and outstanding shares of pt union trans internusa indonesia as of february  effective june  and october   we acquired the remaining and of the issued and outstanding shares of uti taiwan limited and uti tasimacilik limited  our turkish subsidiary  respectively 

table of contents in the prior year  effective may  and july   we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of indair carriers pvt ltd 
indair  an indian corporation  and of the issued and outstanding shares of kite logistics pty limited kite  a south african corporation  respectively 
since ihd owns the remaining issued and outstanding shares of kite  we acquired those remaining shares effective june  with our acquisition of ihd 
effectively of kite was sold on november  in conjunction with the sale of of ihd  as discussed above 
in fiscal  the operating results of uti integrated logistics are included in our financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition  october  we acquired the entire issued share capital of uti integrated logistics for an initial purchase price of approximately million 
the final total consideration for this acquisition was million of which approximately million represented goodwill and other intangible assets  after the conclusion  of the two year period following the date of acquisition  during which period additional consideration was payable dependent on certain performance criteria being achieved 
reorganization of south african operations in fiscal  we executed the documentation for a transaction designed to qualify our south african operations as black empowered under recently enacted legislation in south africa 
the transaction did not impact our ihd operations 
pursuant to this transaction  our subsidiary pyramid freight proprietary limited which we refer to as pyramid freight sold most of its south african operations to a newly formed corporation called uti south africa proprietary limited which we refer to as utisa 
utisa also assumed liabilities associated with the transferred businesses 
the businesses were transferred to utisa in exchange for an interest bearing obligation pursuant to which utisa owes pyramid freight the principal sum of million south african rand equivalent to million as of january  
under the terms of this loan  the outstanding balance bears interest at an effective annual rate of 
three months prior to the fifth anniversary of the loan  the parties are to meet to negotiate the terms of repayment of the outstanding principal on the loan 
if the parties are unable to agree on the terms of repayment  the outstanding principal and any remaining accrued and unpaid interest thereon are repayable in full on demand 
utisa has the right to prepay the loan without penalty 
utisa was formed for the purpose of this transaction and approximately of its outstanding share capital is held by pyramid freight with the remaining approximately held by the uti empowerment trust  a trust registered in south africa which we refer to as the empowerment trust 
the empowerment trust was established to provide broad based educational benefits to uti s staff in south africa and their dependants 
the transaction allows the empowerment trust to  in substance  share in approximately of the future net income of uti s current south africa operations excluding ihd above fiscal net income levels 
the empowerment trust and pyramid freight also entered into a shareholders agreement which provides for the method of appointing directors by the parties and contains other provisions concerning board and shareholder meetings  preemptive rights  rights of first refusal and other matters 
discussion of operating results the following discussion of our operating results explains material changes in our consolidated results of operations for fiscal and fiscal compared to the respective prior year 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements for many reasons  including  but not limited to  those factors described in this item under  factors that may affect future results and other cautionary statements  and elsewhere in this report 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
our consolidated financial statements attached to this report  have been prepared in us dollars and in accordance with us gaap 

table of contents geographic segment operating results we manage our business through four geographic segments comprised of europe  the americas  asia pacific and africa  which offer similar products and services 
each geographic segment is managed regionally by executives who are directly accountable to and maintain regular contact with our chief executive officer to discuss operating activities  financial results  forecasts and plans for each geographic region 
for segment reporting purposes by geographic region  airfreight and ocean freight forwarding gross revenues for the movement of goods is attributed to the country where the shipment originates 
gross revenues  as well as net revenues  for all other services are attributed to the country where the services are performed 
net revenues for airfreight and ocean freight forwarding related to the movement of the goods are prorated between the country of origin and the destination country  based on a standard formula 
our gross and net revenues and operating income by operating segment for the fiscal years ended january  and  along with the dollar amount of the changes and the percentage changes between the time periods shown  are set forth in the following tables in thousands year ended january  gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total change to year ended january  from year ended january  amount percentage gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total year ended january  gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total 
table of contents change to year ended january  from year ended january  amount percentage gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total our europe region showed improvements in gross and net revenues for fiscal versus fiscal primarily due to organic growth in both air and ocean freight forwarding  which resulted primarily from higher shipment volumes in fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased revenues from our contract logistics services  which improved in fiscal by over when compared to the contract logistics revenues reported in the corresponding prior year period 
secondarily  the impact of favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to the corresponding prior year resulted in increased gross and net revenues reported during the current year 
the europe region reported the largest improvement in operating income of all of our regions during fiscal when compared to fiscal due to higher freight volumes as well as controls over spending which were put in place starting in the third quarter of fiscal to hold the increase in costs to a lower percentage than our increase in net revenues 
the increases in gross and net revenues in the americas region for fiscal as compared to the corresponding prior year were also due primarily to organic growth related to higher airfreight and ocean freight forwarding volumes during fiscal contract logistics revenues in the americas region benefited from the acquisition of unigistix during the third quarter of fiscal similar to our europe region  the improvement in operating income in the americas region was a result of higher freight volumes and from on going efforts to hold the increases in costs to a lower percentage than our increase in net revenues 
our asia pacific region posted the highest gross revenues of all our regions for fiscal the increase in fiscal in gross revenues in this region was driven primarily by higher ocean freight volumes in the region  followed by higher airfreight volumes  over the prior year 
the acquisition of indair  which was effective may   also helped to improve airfreight gross and net revenues in fiscal as we received a full year benefit from this acquisition in fiscal asia pacific continues to be our region with the highest operating profit margins  calculated by dividing operating income for the region by net revenues for the region  increasing to for fiscal from for fiscal these increases in operating profit margin were due to increased productivity in the region through the higher freight volumes as well as managing our operating costs so that they did not increase more than the rate of growth in our net revenues 
gross revenue in our africa region more than doubled in fiscal and net revenue increased by as compared to fiscal due primarily to organic growth  driven by higher freight volumes  and to the impact of favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar as well as the acquisition impact of kite and ihd 
operating income increased in the region at a faster rate than the growth of net revenues  again reflecting the productivity benefits of higher freight volumes as well as the control of costs at lower rates than the growth of net revenues 
because of the integrated nature of our business  with global customers being served by all of our regions and with at least two regions often operating together to carry out our freight forwarding services  we also analyze our business by type of service in addition to looking at our results by geographic regions 
by service line  our total increase of million  or  in gross revenue in fiscal over fiscal was due to increases in airfreight forwarding of million  ocean freight forwarding of million  contract logistics of million  other revenue of million and customs brokerage of million 

table of contents of the increase in total gross revenue in fiscal versus the comparable prior year  we estimate that over was due to organic growth as a result of additional business from new and existing clients as well as price increases from various air and ocean carriers  while less than was due to the impact of favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar and less than was due to the impact of acquisitions 
we believe that net revenue is a better measure than gross revenue of the importance to us of our various services since our gross revenue for our services as an indirect air and ocean carrier includes the carriers charges to us for carriage of the shipment 
when we act as an indirect air and ocean carrier  our net revenue is determined by the differential between the rates charged to us by the carrier and the rates we charge our customers plus the fees we receive for our ancillary services 
net revenue derived from freight forwarding generally is shared between the points of origin and destination 
contract logistics net revenue excludes transportation costs incurred in providing contract logistics services 
the following table shows our net revenues and our operating expenses for the periods presented  expressed as a percentage of total net revenues 
year ended january  net revenues airfreight forwarding ocean freight forwarding customs brokerage contract logistics other total net revenues operating expenses staff costs depreciation and amortization amortization of intangible assets other operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense gains losses on foreign exchange pretax income provision for income taxes minority interests net income less than one percent 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal overall  our net revenue benefited from organic growth from all our operations  from the impact of acquisitions made during fiscal as well as from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
on a constant currency basis when we translate our fiscal results using currency exchange rates in effect for fiscal  we estimate that acquisitions and favorable exchange rates accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the net revenue increase for fiscal versus the prior fiscal year 

table of contents airfreight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase primarily resulted from organic growth in all regions and favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to fiscal  mostly in our africa and europe regions  due to changes in the south african rand and the euro  respectively  compared to the us dollar 
airfreight volumes increased in all regions  although the benefit of this increase was offset by the higher carrier costs  resulting in lower airfreight yields overall in fiscal when compared to fiscal we experienced our highest volume growth for fiscal in asia and africa 
ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased volumes in fiscal versus fiscal especially in the africa and asia pacific regions  which offset our decline in yields caused by price increases from ocean carriers which were typically passed through to customers at lower margins than we have historically experienced 
customs brokerage net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal customs brokerage net revenue increased primarily as a result of the higher shipping volumes resulting from increased demand for our airfreight and ocean freight services 
contract logistics net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
we estimate that approximately of this increase for fiscal was due to the acquisitions of ihd and unigistix during fiscal other net revenue  which includes revenue from our other supply chain management services including outsourced distribution services  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to organic growth particularly in the americas and africa regions  as well as from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
staff costs increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year 
staff costs were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of increased resources to accommodate the increase in business activity  an increase in reported staff costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year and the addition of personnel in connection with our acquisitions of ihd and unigistix  which we estimated accounted for approximately million of the total increase 
total staff costs expressed as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease when expressed as a percentage of net revenues was primarily related to an increase in these costs at a slower rate of growth than the increase in net revenue 
staff costs are the largest component of operating expenses and we strive to manage these costs in relation to net revenue growth 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for fiscal over fiscal to million primarily due to increases in capital spending for computer equipment and fixtures and fittings during the period  along with the impact of fiscal business acquisitions and the full year impact of fiscal business acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly to of net revenue in fiscal as compared to in the prior year when expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal generally these expenses increased because of the increased costs associated with the higher volumes and organic growth experienced by the company  as well as an increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions in fiscal over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
in addition  operating costs as a result of the acquisitions of ihd and unigistix  accounted for approximately million of the total increase in other operating expenses in fiscal included in other operating expenses for fiscal are facilities and communications costs of million compared to million of such costs for the prior fiscal year 
facilities and communications costs increased primarily as a result of the addition of new locations in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  including those acquired with ihd and unigistix 
the balance of the other operating expenses is comprised of selling  general and administrative costs 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs were million compared to million for the same prior 
table of contents year period 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the increased level of business activity  the increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
in addition the acquisitions of ihd and unigistix during the year increased other operating expenses estimated to be million 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal our interest income relates primarily to interest earned on our cash deposits  while our interest expense consists primarily of interest on our credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
both interest income and interest expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million  or  and million  or  respectively  due to the cash used in our acquisitions and the additional working capital requirements for the increase in business activity during fiscal the effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a change in the geographic composition of our worldwide taxable income when compared to the prior year 
for fiscal  we currently anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately  although such rate may fluctuate due to the geographic mix of our taxable income 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year for the reasons listed above 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal overall  our net revenue benefited from the full year effect of acquisitions made in fiscal primarily uti integrated logistics and from the impact of acquisitions made during fiscal as well as from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar and organic growth from our operations 
on a constant currency basis when we translate our fiscal results using currency exchange rates in effect for fiscal  we estimate that acquisitions and favorable exchange rates accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the net revenue increase for fiscal versus the prior fiscal year 
the total increase due to acquisitions of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects the acquisition benefit of uti integrated logistics on net revenues of million 
airfreight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase primarily resulted from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to fiscal  mostly in our africa and europe regions  due to changes in the south african rand and the euro  respectively  and to organic growth in all regions 
increased volumes in africa led to growth in that region 
the europe region improved their yields to help offset lower export volumes  resulting in an overall increase in the europe region s net revenues  excluding the currency translation impact 
asia pacific s volumes grew in fiscal over the prior year  even considering the higher volumes reported in fiscal as a result of increased demand in airfreight created by last year s west coast port lock out 
we also experienced some growth in airfreight forwarding net revenues in the americas region as slightly higher export volumes offset a slight decline in yields 
ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased volumes in fiscal versus fiscal  especially in the africa and asia pacific regions  which offset our decline in yields caused by price increases from ocean carriers which were typically passed through to customers at lower margins than we have historically experienced 
customs brokerage net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal customs brokerage net revenue increased primarily as a result of the higher shipping volumes resulting from increased demand for our services 

table of contents contract logistics net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the full year contribution from the uti integrated logistics acquisition in fiscal other net revenue  which includes revenue from our other supply chain management services including outsourced distribution services  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was also primarily due to the full year contribution from the uti integrated logistics acquisition in fiscal staff costs increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year  primarily as a result of the addition of personnel in connection with our acquisition of uti integrated logistics  which accounted for approximately million of the total increase 
staff costs were also generally higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of an increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
the increase in total staff costs expressed as a percentage of net revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily related to uti integrated logistics contract logistics business which has historically experienced higher staff costs as a percentage of net revenues than our freight forwarding operations and we expect staff costs to generally be higher when expressed as a percentage of net revenues as compared to our historic trends 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for fiscal over fiscal to million primarily due to increases in capital spending for computer equipment and fixtures and fittings during the period  along with the impact of fiscal acquisitions and the full year impact of fiscal acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense declined slightly to of net revenue in fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal generally these expenses increased because of the full year impact of our acquisition of uti integrated logistics estimated to be million and also because of an increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
included in other operating expenses for fiscal are facilities and communications costs of million compared to million of such costs for the prior fiscal year 
facilities and communications costs increased primarily as a result of the addition of new locations in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  including those acquired with uti integrated logistics 
the balance of the other operating expenses is comprised of selling  general and administrative costs 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs were million compared to million for the same prior year period 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the acquisition of uti integrated logistics estimated to be million and secondarily to the stronger euro and south african rand when compared to the us dollar 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal both interest income and interest expense increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to the higher levels of cash balances in fiscal due to the cash received in december from our follow on stock offering  while the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the acquisition impact of uti integrated logistics 
the effective income tax rate decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the prior year effective income tax rate including the establishment of certain valuation allowances and changes in local tax rates  which were not repeated in fiscal net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year for the reasons listed above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  representing an increase of million from january   as a result of generating a net amount of million of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities and a positive impact of million related to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on our cash balances 
historically  we have used our internally generated net cash flow from operating activities along with the net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
in fiscal  we generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities 
this resulted from net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets totaling million and other items totaling million  plus an increase in trade receivables and other current assets of million and an increase in trade payables and other current liabilities of million 
during fiscal  we used an aggregate of million of cash for acquisitions and contingent earn out payments  of which approximately million net of cash acquired  million and million was used to acquire unigistix  ihd and et logistics  respectively 
we also used a total of approximately million to increase our shareholdings in our indonesian  taiwanese  turkish and other subsidiaries and approximately million was used for a final contingent earn out payment related to our acquisition of the continental group of companies made in fiscal approximately million of cash was used for an earn out payment related to our january acquisition of sli 
future earn out payment calculations  which may result in a significant use of cash or in the case of our acquisition of sli  the possible issuance of shares as the acquisition agreement permits the sellers to elect  at their option  the earn out payment in the form of ordinary shares instead of cash at a deemed price of per ordinary share  include the two remaining contingent earn out payment calculations related to our acquisition of sli  which are scheduled for the third quarters of fiscal and fiscal  four contingent earn out payments related to our acquisition of et logistics which will be calculated based on a multiple of the acquired operation s future earnings for each of the fiscal years in the four year period ending january  and two contingent earn out payments related to our acquisition of unigistix which will also be calculated based on a multiple of the acquired operation s future earnings for each of the two twelve month periods in the period ending october  and are subject to a maximum of million 
there are no contractual limits on the cash amounts that may be payable under the contingent earn out payment terms for sli or et logistics as they are contingent on the earnings of each of the acquired businesses  however  we anticipate that the contingent earn out payments would generally be self funding in that the increased earnings from the operations would be used to fund the earn out payments 
during fiscal  cash used for capital expenditures was million  consisting primarily of computer hardware and software and furniture  fixtures and fittings 
our financing activities during fiscal provided million of cash  primarily due to net increased borrowing on our bank lines of credit of million 
additionally  we paid dividends of million during fiscal we expect to use approximately million of cash in the second quarter of fiscal for the payment of dividends on our ordinary shares as declared by our board of directors on april  credit facilities we have various bank credit facilities established in countries where such facilities are required for our business 
at january  these facilities provided for borrowing capacities ranging from approximately million to million totaling million  and also provided for guarantees  which are a necessary part of our business  totaling million  for total credit facilities of million 
our borrowings under these facilities totaled million at january  and we had approximately million of available  unused borrowing capacity under our various bank lines of credit 
certain of these facilities have financial covenants  with which the company was in compliance as of january  due to the global nature of our business  we utilize a number of different financial institutions to provide these various facilities 
consequently  the use of a particular credit facility is normally restricted to the country 
table of contents in which it originated and a particular credit facility may restrict distributions by the subsidiary operating in the country 
most of our borrowings are secured by grants of security interests in accounts receivable and other assets  including pledges of stock of our subsidiaries 
the interest rates on these facilities vary and ranged from to at january  these rates are generally linked to the prime lending rate in each country where we have facilities 
we use our credit facilities to primarily fund our working capital needs as well as to provide for customs bonds and guarantees and forward exchange transactions 
the customs bonds and guarantees relate primarily to our obligations for credit that is extended to us in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers  primarily airlines  and for duty and tax deferrals granted by governmental entities responsible for the collection of customs duties and value added taxes 
the total underlying amounts that are due and payable by us for transportation costs and governmental excises are recorded as liabilities in our financial statements 
therefore  no additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees in the unlikely event that the guarantor company were to be required to perform as those liabilities would be duplicative 
while the majority of our borrowings are due and payable within one year  we believe we should be able to renew such facilities on commercially reasonable terms 
on december   certain of our subsidiaries in south africa entered into a senior revolving credit facility agreement with nedbank in south africa nedbank sa  which provides for an aggregate credit facility of million south african rand equivalent to approximately million as of january  
of this facility  approximately million is available for overdrafts  million is available for guarantees and standby letters of credit  million is available for capital leases and million is available for foreign exchange contracts 
as with our nedbank uk facility discussed below and with other facilities we have had with nedbank in the past  this facility is available on an ongoing basis until further notice  subject to nedbank sa s credit review procedures and may be terminated by the bank at any time 
in the event this credit facility is terminated by the bank  we would be required to seek replacement financing which could involve selling equity securities or incurring debt from another lender which may not be on terms as advantageous as those we obtained from nedbank sa 
the facility is secured by cross guarantees and indemnities of selected subsidiary companies 
as of january   our second largest credit facility was with nedbank limited in the united kingdom nedbank uk  totaling million british pounds sterling equivalent to approximately million as of january  
of this facility  approximately million is primarily used for guarantees and standby letters of credit to secure banking facilities and million is primarily used for guaranteeing performance undertakings of our subsidiary companies 
the facility is available on an ongoing basis until further notice  subject to nedbank uk s credit review procedures and may be terminated by the bank at any time 
in the event this credit facility is terminated by the bank  we would be required to seek replacement financing which could involve selling equity securities or incurring debt from another lender which may not be on terms as advantageous as those we obtained from nedbank uk 
the facility is secured by cross guarantees and indemnities of selected subsidiary companies 
our third largest credit facility as of january  was a senior revolving syndicated credit facility agreement between certain of our subsidiaries in the united states and lasalle bank national association as agent  and various other lenders  which provides for up to million of borrowings based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable primarily for use in our operations in the united states 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of our us subsidiaries as well as a pledge of the stock of the us subsidiaries 
this credit facility matures in august and contains financial and other covenants and restrictions applicable to our us operations and a change of control provision applicable to changes at the us holding company level 
this agreement limits the right of the us operating company to distribute funds to holding companies 

table of contents contractual obligations at january   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years bank and other long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations total interest expense is not included due to the variable rate nature of interest rates on these obligations 
includes interest expense due to the fixed nature of interest rates on these obligations 
we believe that with our current cash position  various bank credit facilities and operating cash flows  we have sufficient means to meet our working capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months as our operations are currently conducted 
the nature of our operations necessitates dealing in many foreign currencies and our results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease obligations  which are included in the preceding contractual obligations table  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation to date  our business has not been significantly or adversely affected by inflation 
historically  we have been generally successful in passing carrier rate increases and surcharges on to our customers by means of price increases and surcharges 
direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term 
due to the high degree of competition in the marketplace  these rate increases might lead to an erosion of our profit margins 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion of our operating and financial review and prospects is based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with us gaap and contained within this report 
certain amounts included in  or affecting  our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable and various other recorded and disclosed amounts 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our significant accounting polices are included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements included in this report  however  we believe that certain accounting policies are more critical to our financial statement preparation process than others 
these include our policies on revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  contingencies and currency translation 

table of contents revenue recognition gross revenue represents billings on exports to customers  plus net revenue on imports  net of any billings for value added taxes  custom duties and freight insurance premiums whereby we act as an agent 
gross revenue and freight consolidation costs for airfreight and ocean freight forwarding services  including commissions earned from our services as an authorized agent for airline and ocean carriers and third party freight insurers  are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin which is when the customer is billed 
gross customs brokerage revenue  contract logistics revenue and other revenue are recognized when we bill the customer  which for customs brokerage revenue is when the necessary documentation for customs clearance has been completed  and for contract logistics and other revenue is when the service has been provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business 
net revenue is determined by deducting freight consolidation costs from gross revenue 
freight consolidation costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin 
certain costs  related primarily to ancillary services  are estimated and accrued at the time the services are provided  and adjusted upon receipt of the suppliers final invoices 
income taxes our overall effective income tax rate is determined by the geographic composition of our worldwide taxable income  with some of our operations in countries with low effective income tax rates 
consequently our accrual of tax expense on an interim basis is based on an estimate of our overall effective tax rate for the related annual period 
deferred income taxes are accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable income 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences 
deferred income taxes are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled 
deferred income taxes are charged or credited to the income statement 
deferred income tax assets are offset by valuation allowances so that the assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable income will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized 
we consider our historical performance  forecast taxable income and other factors when we determine the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to determine future taxable income to be reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful receivables we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on a variety of factors and estimates 
these factors include historical customer trends  general and specific economic conditions and local market conditions 
we believe our estimate for doubtful receivables is based on reasonable assumptions and estimates  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 no amortization was recorded for goodwill for acquisitions completed after june  further  effective february   in accordance with sfas no 
 we discontinued the amortization relating to all existing goodwill 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets be assessed at least annually for impairment 
this assessment requires the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units on the income approach  which requires the use of estimates in determining future revenues  cash flows and capital expenditures  as well as market trends and growth 
we believe these estimates and assumptions to be 
table of contents reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
we complete the required impairment test annually in the second quarter  or when certain events occur or circumstances change 
contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
where the company is self insured in relation to freight related exposures  adequate liabilities are estimated and recorded for the portion we are self insured 
when estimates of our exposure from claims or pending or threatened litigation matters meet the recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to us may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
currency translation for consolidation purposes  balance sheets of subsidiaries expressed in currencies other than us dollars are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
operating results for the fiscal year are translated using average rates of exchange for the fiscal year 
gains and losses on translation are recorded as a separate component of equity and are included in other comprehensive income or loss 
transactions in foreign currencies during the year are remeasured at rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions 
these gains and losses arising on remeasurement are accounted for in the income statement 
exchange differences arising on the translation of long term structural loans to subsidiary companies are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss 
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date of the company s subsidiaries expressed in currencies different to their functional currencies  are remeasured at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
the financial statements of foreign entities that report in the currency of a hyper inflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit currency at the balance sheet date before they are translated into us dollars

factors that may affect future results and other cautionary statements in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following factors  risks and uncertainties in evaluating our business 
our business and operations are subject to a number of factors  risks and uncertainties  and the following list should not be considered to be a definitive list of all factors that may affect our business  financial condition and future results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the factors  risks and uncertainties contained in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we caution readers that any forward looking statements made by us are made with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act and that a number of factors  including but not limited to those discussed below  could caused our actual results and experiences to differ materially from the anticipated results or expectations expressed in any forward looking statements 
we conduct business throughout the world and our results of operations may be impacted by international trade volumes and by global  regional and local economic conditions 
our business is related to and dependent on general world economic conditions  and the local  regional  national and international conditions that affect international trade and the specific regions or countries that we serve 
we are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in our customers business cycles  
table of contents particularly in market segments and industries such as apparel  pharmaceutical  chemical  automotive and high technology electronics  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts  may adversely affect the global economy  international trade volumes  our customers and their ability to pay for services 
the consequences of any armed conflict are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 
we expect that our revenue and results of operations will continue to be sensitive to global and regional economic conditions 
our international presence exposes us to potential difficulties and risks associated with distant operations and to various economic  regulatory  political and other uncertainties and risks 
we conduct a majority of our business outside of the united states and we anticipate that revenue from foreign operations will continue to account for a significant amount of our future revenue 
our international operations are directly related to and dependent on the volume of international trade and the social  economic and political conditions in various countries 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our net revenues were generated in south africa and our south african assets represented approximately of our total assets as of january  our international operations and international commerce are influenced by many factors  including changes in economic  social and political conditions and in governmental policies  changes in international and domestic customs regulations  wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts  natural disasters  changes in tariffs  trade restrictions  trade agreements and taxation  difficulties in staffing  managing or overseeing foreign operations  expropriation of our international assets  limitations on the repatriation of assets  including cash  different liability standards and less developed legal systems that may be less predictable than those in the united states  and intellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 
restrictions and controls on investments and acquisitions outside of the united states may restrict our ability to operate in those countries 
investments in joint ventures or businesses outside of the united states have been and will continue to be restricted or controlled to varying degrees 
these restrictions or controls have and may continue to limit or preclude investments in proposed joint ventures or business acquisitions outside of the united states or increase our costs and expenses in seeking to effect such transactions 
various governments require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons and limit the extent of any such investments 
furthermore  various governments restrict investment opportunities by foreign persons in some industries or may require governmental approval for the repatriation of capital and income by foreign investors 
there can be no assurance that such approvals will be forthcoming in the future 
there also can be no assurance that additional or different restrictions or adverse policies applicable to us or our investments in various countries will not be imposed in the future or  if imposed  as to the duration or impact of any such restrictions or policies 

table of contents we are dependent on our relationship with our agents and key employees in some countries 
we conduct business in some countries using a local agent who can provide knowledge of the local market conditions and facilitate the acquisition of necessary licenses and permits 
we rely in part upon the services of these agents  as well as our country level executives  branch managers and other key employees  to market our services  to act as intermediaries with customers and to provide other services on our behalf 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in maintaining our relationships with our agents or key employees in various foreign countries  or that we will find qualified replacements for agents and key employees who may terminate their relationships with us 
because our agents and employees may occasionally have the primary relationship with certain of our customers  we could lose some customers if a particular agent or employee were to terminate his or her relationship with us 
the loss of or failure to obtain qualified agents or employees in a particular country or region could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of our operations and or the failure to develop our business in that country or region 
foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could increase or decrease the book value of our assets 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
for the fiscal year ended january   we derived a substantial portion of our gross revenue in currencies other than the united states dollar and  due to the global nature of our operations  we expect in the foreseeable future to continue to conduct a significant amount of our business in currencies other than our reporting currency 
appreciation or depreciation in the value of other currencies as compared to our reporting currency will result in currency translation exchange gains or losses which  if the appreciation or depreciation is significant  could be material 
in those areas where our revenue is denominated in a local currency rather than our reporting currency  a depreciation of the local currency against the united states dollar could adversely affect our reported united states dollar earnings 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency 
as such  when the value of those assets is translated into united states dollars  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the book value of our assets 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
we will experience the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our consolidated net income in the future 
because our business is dependent on commercial airfreight carriers and air charter operators  ocean freight carriers and other transportation companies  changes in available cargo capacity and other changes affecting such carriers  as well as interruptions in service or work stoppages by such carriers  may negatively impact our business 
we rely on commercial airfreight carriers and air charter operators  ocean freight carriers  trucking companies and other transportation companies for the movement of our customers cargo 
consequently  our ability to provide these services for our clients could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity  changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling  pricing  payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel  taxes and labor  and other factors not within our control 
reductions in airfreight or ocean freight capacity could negatively impact our yields 
material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation  whether caused by strike  work stoppage  lock out  slowdown or otherwise  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business is subject to seasonal trends 
historically  our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
our first and fourth fiscal quarters are traditionally weaker compared with our other fiscal quarters 
this trend is dependent on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  climate  economic conditions and numerous other factors 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand or are based on just in time production schedules 
therefore  our revenue is  to a larger degree  affected by factors that are outside of 
table of contents our control 
there can be no assurance that our historic operating patterns will continue in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors 
comparisons of our operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and it is likely that they will continue to fluctuate in the future because of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors and changes in the shipping patterns of our customers may adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  the following factors could also cause fluctuations in our operating results personnel costs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  costs relating to the expansion of operations  costs and revenue fluctuations due to acquisitions  pricing and availability of cargo space on airlines  ships and trucks which we utilize to transport freight  adjustments in inventory levels  fluctuations in fuel surcharges  pricing pressures from our competitors  changes in our customers requirements for contract logistics and outsourcing services  customer discounts and credits  and timing and magnitude of capital expenditures 
because our quarterly revenues and operating results vary significantly  comparisons of our results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
we have grown and plan to grow  in part  through acquisitions of other freight forwarders  customs brokers  contract logistics providers and supply chain management providers 
growth by acquisitions involves risks and we may not be able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy or successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations 
we have grown through acquisitions and we may pursue opportunities to expand our business by acquiring other companies in the future 
acquisitions involve risks including those relating to identification of appropriate acquisition candidates or negotiation of acquisitions on favorable terms and valuations  integration of acquired businesses and personnel  implementation of proper business and accounting controls  ability to obtain financing  on favorable terms or at all  diversion of management attention  retention of employees and customers  and unexpected costs  expenses and liabilities 
our growth strategy may affect short term cash flow and net income as we expend funds  increase indebtedness and incur additional expenses in connection with pursuing acquisitions 
we also may issue our 
table of contents ordinary shares from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments 
in the event any such acquisition or investment is significant  the number of our ordinary shares that we may issue could in turn be significant 
in addition  we may also grant registration rights covering those ordinary shares in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 
acquisitions completed by us have included contingent earn out arrangements which provide for payments which may be made by us in cash which would reduce the amount of cash available to us or could cause us to incur additional indebtedness and by our issuance of additional shares resulting in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares 
if we are not able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy or if we fail to successfully integrate any acquired companies into our operations  we may not achieve anticipated increases in revenue  cost savings and economies of scale  and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our growth and profitability may not continue  which may result in a decrease in our stock price 
we experienced significant growth in revenue and operating income over the past several years 
there can be no assurance that our growth rate will continue or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management  administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
we can provide no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in industry  economic or political conditions 
slower or less profitable growth or losses would adversely affect our results of operations  which may result in a decrease in our stock price 
we may not succeed with our nextleap strategic operating plan  and as a result our revenue and profitability may not increase 
we recently completed the twelfth quarter of nextleap  our five year strategic operating plan designed to help us transition from being a global freight forwarding operator to a global integrated logistics provider offering our customers a comprehensive range of services across the entire supply chain 
under nextleap  we are undertaking various efforts to attempt to increase the number of our customers and our revenue  improve our operating margins  and train and develop our employees 
we face numerous challenges in trying to achieve our objectives under this strategic plan  including challenges involving attempts to leverage customer relationships  improved margins  integrate acquisitions and improve our systems 
we also face challenges developing  training and recruiting personnel 
this strategic operating plan requires that we successfully manage our operations and growth which we may not be able to do as well as we anticipate 
our industry is extremely competitive and our business is subject to numerous factors and risks beyond our control and we may not be able to successfully implement nextleap and no assurance can be given that our efforts will result in increased revenues  improved margins or profitability 
if we are not able to increase our revenue or improve our operating margins in the future  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our effective income tax rate will impact our results of operations  cash flow and profitability 
we have international operations and generate taxable income in different countries throughout the world  with different effective income tax rates 
our future effective income tax rate will be impacted by a number of factors  including the geographical composition of our worldwide taxable income 
if the tax laws of the countries in which we operate are rescinded or changed or the united states or other foreign tax authorities were to change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner or jurisdiction in which our profits are recognized  our effective income tax rate could increase  which would adversely impact our cash flow and profitability 
we face intense competition in the freight forwarding  contract logistics and supply chain management industry 
the freight forwarding  contract logistics and supply chain management industry is intensely competitive and we expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future 
we face competition from a number of companies  including many that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry 
we also encounter competition from regional and local third party logistics providers  freight forwarders and integrated transportation 
table of contents companies 
depending on the location of the customer and the scope of services requested  we must compete against both the niche players  including wholesalers in the pharmaceutical industry  and larger competitors 
in addition  customers increasingly are turning to competitive bidding situations involving bids from a number of competitors  including competitors that are larger than us 
we also face competition from air and ocean carriers  computer information and consulting firms and contract manufacturers  all of which traditionally operated outside of the supply chain management industry  but are now beginning to expand the scope of their operations to include supply chain related services 
increased competition could result in reduced revenues  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could damage the long term or short term prospects of our business 
our industry is consolidating and if we cannot gain sufficient market presence in our industry  we may not be able to compete successfully against larger  global companies in our industry 
there currently is a marked trend within our industry toward consolidation of niche players into larger companies which are attempting to increase their global operations through the acquisition of freight forwarders and contract logistics providers 
if we cannot gain sufficient market presence in our industry through internal expansion and additional acquisitions  we may not be able to compete successfully against larger  global companies in our industry 
we are dependent on key management personnel and the loss of any such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
our future performance depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of our key management personnel  including roger macfarlane chief executive officer  matthys wessels vice chairman of the board and chief executive officer african region  alan draper executive vice president and president asia pacific region  john hextall president europe  middle east and north africa region and president americas region for freight forwarding  gene ochi senior vice president marketing and global growth and lawrence samuels senior vice president finance  chief financial officer and secretary 
there can be no assurance that we can retain such key managerial employees 
the unplanned loss of the services of one or more of these or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and address issues of succession planning if we are to realize our goal of growing our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts 
because we are a holding company  we are financially dependent on receiving distributions from our subsidiaries and we could be harmed if such distributions could not be made in the future 
we are a holding company and all of our operations are conducted through subsidiaries 
consequently  we rely on dividends or advances from our subsidiaries including those that are wholly owned to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our ordinary shares 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and our ability to receive distributions on our investments in other entities is subject to applicable local law and other restrictions including  but not limited to  applicable tax laws and limitations contained in some of their bank credit facilities 
such laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends and distributions to us which would restrict our ability to continue operations 
in general  our subsidiaries cannot pay dividends to us in excess of their retained earnings and most countries in which we conduct business require us to pay a distribution tax on all dividends paid 
because we manage our business on a localized basis in many countries around the world  our operations and internal controls may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices 
we manage our business in many countries around the world  with local and regional management retaining responsibility for day to day operations  profitability and the growth of the business 
our operating approach can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated practices and procedures throughout our global operations  including implementing and maintaining effective internal controls throughout our worldwide organization 
in addition  some of our subsidiaries operate with manage 
table of contents ment  sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective businesses without regional oversight and global coordination 
our decentralized operating approach could result in inconsistent management practices and procedures and adversely affect our overall profitability  and ultimately our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
although as of january  we had no material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined by the public company accounting oversight board  there can be no assurances that we will be able to comply in future years with the requirements and deadlines of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  particularly in light of our decentralized management structure 
a reported material weakness or the failure to meet the reporting deadline of section could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and this loss of confidence could cause a decline in market price of our stock 
we may need additional financing to fund our operations and finance our growth or we may need replacement financing  and we may not be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may require additional financing to fund our operations and our current plans for expansion 
because our credit facilities often are limited to the country in which the facility is originated  we may require additional financing to fund our operations in countries in which we do not have existing credit facilities 
in addition  when our existing credit facilities expire  we may need to obtain replacement financing 
our two largest credit facilities are with nedbank  and the bank has the right to terminate these facilities at any time and cause the interest and principal outstanding under these facilities to become immediately due and payable 
additional or replacement financing may involve incurring debt or selling equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional or replacement financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we incur additional debt  the risks associated with our business could increase 
if we raise capital through the sale of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be diluted 
in addition  any new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our ordinary shares 
if we are unable to obtain additional or replacement financing  our ability to fund our operations and meet our current plans for expansion will be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to develop and integrate information technology systems or we fail to upgrade or replace our information technology systems to handle increased volumes and levels of complexity  meet the demands of our customers and protect against disruptions of our operations  we may lose inventory items  orders or customers  which could seriously harm our business 
increasingly  we compete for customers based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the information technology systems supporting our services 
the failure of the hardware or software that supports our information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems  or the inability to access or interact with our web site or connect electronically  could significantly disrupt our operations  prevent customers from placing orders  or cause us to lose inventory items  orders or customers 
if our information technology systems are unable to handle additional volume for our operations as our business and scope of services grow  our service levels  operating efficiency and future transaction volumes will decline 
in addition  we expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated  fully integrated information technology systems from their supply chain services providers 
if we fail to hire qualified persons to implement  maintain and protect our information technology systems or we fail to upgrade or replace our information technology systems to handle increased volumes and levels of complexity  meet the demands of our customers and protect against disruptions of our operations  we may lose inventory items  orders or customers  which could seriously harm our business 
our information technology systems are subject to risks which we cannot control 
our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers  web browsers  telephone systems and other aspects of the internet infrastructure which have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past 
our systems are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
despite our implementation of network security 
table of contents measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt or damage our information technology systems and inhibit our internal operations  our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our information technology systems 
we may be adversely affected if we are unable to license the software necessary for our information technology system 
we license a variety of software that is used in our information technology system  which we call empower 
as a result  the success and functionality of our information technology system is dependent upon our ability to continue our licenses for this software 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these licenses or replace the functionality provided by this software on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the failure to maintain these licenses or a significant delay in the replacement of this software could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  the value of such rights may diminish and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
these protections may not be sufficient  and they do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products or services 
further  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect our intellectual property rights could result in the loss or diminution in value of such rights 
if we are not able to limit our liability for customers claims through contract terms and limit our exposure through the purchase of insurance  we could be required to pay large amounts to our customers as compensation for their claims and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in general  we seek to limit by contract and or international conventions and laws our liability to our customers for loss or damage to their goods to per kilogram approximately per pound or sdrs special drawing rights for airfreight shipments depending on the international convention applicable and per carton or customary unit  or sdrs per package sdrs per kilo whichever is higher including an ocean container  for ocean freight shipments  again depending on the international convention 
for truck land based risks there are a variety of limits ranging from a nominal amount to full value 
however  because a freight forwarder s relationship to an airline or ocean carrier is that of a shipper to a carrier  the airline or ocean carrier generally assumes the same responsibility to us as we assume to our customers 
when we act in the capacity of an authorized agent for an air or ocean carrier  the carrier  rather than us  assumes liability for the safe delivery of the customer s cargo to its ultimate destination  other than in respect of any of our own errors and omissions 
we have  from time to time  made payments to our customers for claims related to our services and may make such payments in the future 
should we experience an increase in the number or size of such claims or an increase in liability pursuant to claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims  our results could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will provide us with adequate coverage for such claims or that the maximum amounts for which we are liable in connection with our services will not change in the future or exceed our insurance levels 
as with every insurance policy there are limits  exclusions and deductibles that apply 
in addition  significant increases in insurance costs could reduce our profitability 
the failure of our policies and procedures which are designed to prevent the unlawful transportation or storage of hazardous  explosive or illegal materials could subject us to large fines  penalties or lawsuits 
we are subject to a broad range of foreign and domestic including state and local environmental  health and safety and criminal laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the shipment of explosive or illegal substances 
in the course of our operations  we may be asked to arrange for the storage or transportation of 
table of contents substances defined as hazardous under applicable laws 
as is the case with any such operation  if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from our facilities or from the transporter  we may be required to participate in the remedy of  or otherwise bear liability for  such release or be subject to claims from third parties whose property or person is injured by the release 
in addition  if we arrange for the storage or transportation of hazardous  explosive or illegal materials in violation of applicable laws or regulations  we may face civil or criminal fines or penalties  including bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas 
in the event we are found to not be in compliance with applicable environmental  health and safety laws and regulations or there is a future finding that our policies and procedures fail to satisfy requisite minimum safeguards or otherwise do not comply with applicable laws or regulations  we could be subject to large fines  penalties or lawsuits and face criminal liability 
in addition  if any damage or injury occurs as a result of the storage or transportation of hazardous  explosive or illegal materials  we may be subject to claims from third parties  and bear liability  for such damage or injury even if we were unaware of the presence of the hazardous  explosive or illegal materials 
if we fail to comply with applicable governmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our permits and licenses and we may experience increased costs as a result of governmental regulation 
our air transportation activities in the united states are subject to regulation by the department of transportation as an indirect air carrier and by the federal aviation administration faa 
we are also subject to security measures and strict shipper and customer classifications by the transportation security administration tsa 
we anticipate new security requirements regarding the handling of airfreight in the near term 
our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation  as necessary 
we are accredited in each of our offices by the international air transport association iata or the cargo network services corporation  a subsidiary of the iata  as a registered agent 
our indirect air carrier status is also subject to the indirect air carrier standard security program administered by the tsa 
we are licensed as a customs broker by the cbp in each united states customs district in which we do business 
all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the cbp 
as a certified and validated party under the self policing c tpat  we are also subject to compliance with security regulations within the trade environment that are enforced by the cbp 
we are also subject to regulations under csi  which is administered by the cbp 
our foreign customs brokerage operations are licensed in and subject to the regulations of their respective countries 
we are licensed as an ocean freight forwarder by and registered as an ocean transportation intermediary with the federal maritime commission 
the federal maritime commission has established qualifications for shipping agents  including surety bonding requirements 
the federal maritime commission also is responsible for the economic regulation of non vessel operating common carriers that contract for space and sell that space to commercial shippers and other non vessel operating common carriers for freight originating or terminating in the united states 
to comply with these economic regulations  vessel operators and non vessel operating common carriers are required to publish tariffs that establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states 
the federal maritime commission has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 
for ocean shipments not originating or terminating in the united states  the applicable regulations and licensing requirements typically are less stringent than those that do originate or terminate in the united states 
as part of our contract logistics services  we operate owned and leased warehouse facilities 
our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services  and we are subject to various federal and state environmental  work safety and hazardous materials regulations  including those in south africa related to the pharmaceutical industry 
we may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for security  as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities 
compliance with changing governmental regulations can be expensive 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or 
table of contents surcharges 
we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business 
our failure to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 
if we are not able to sell container space that we purchase from ocean shipping lines and capacity that we charter from our carriers  we will not be able to recover our out of pocket costs and our profitability may suffer 
as an indirect ocean carrier or non vessel operating common carrier  we contract with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at variable rates 
as an airfreight forwarder  we also charter aircraft capacity to meet peak season volume increases for our customers  particularly in hong kong and other locations in asia 
we then solicit freight from our customers to fill the ocean containers and air charter capacity 
when we contract with ocean shipping lines to obtain containers and with air carriers to obtain charter aircraft capacity  we become obligated to pay for the container space or charter aircraft capacity that we purchase 
if we are not able to sell all of our purchased container space or charter aircraft capacity  we will not be able to recover our out of pocket costs for such purchase of container space or charter aircraft capacity and our results would be adversely affected 
if we lose certain of our contract logistics customers or we cannot maintain adequate levels of utilization in our shared warehouses  then we may experience revenue losses and decreased profitability 
we anticipate that revenues from our contract logistics services will account for an increasing portion of our consolidated revenues and may continue to increase as we further develop and expand our contract logistics  distribution and outsourcing services 
in some cases  we lease single tenant warehouses and distribution facilities under leases with terms longer than the contract logistics services contracts we have with our customers 
we are required to pay rent under these real property leases even if our customers decide not to renew or otherwise terminate their agreements with us and we are not able to obtain new customers for these facilities 
as a result  our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we experience a decline in demand for space in our shared warehouses  then our revenues and earnings may decline as we would continue to be obligated to pay the full amount of the underlying leases 
if we are not reimbursed for amounts which we advance for our customers  our net revenue and profitability may decrease 
we make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs concerning collect freight and customs duties and taxes and in connection with our performance of other contract logistics services 
the billings to our customers for these disbursements may be several times larger than the amount of revenue and fees derived from these transactions 
if we are unable to recover a significant portion of these disbursements or if our customers do not reimburse us for a substantial amount of these disbursements in a timely manner  we may experience net revenue losses and decreased profitability 
our executive officers  directors and principal shareholders control a significant portion of our shares and their interests may be different than or conflict with yours 
our executive officers  directors and principal shareholders and their respective affiliates control a significant portion of our ordinary shares 
as a result  these shareholders may be able to influence us and our affairs  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company  and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these shareholders 
these transactions might include proxy contests  mergers  tender offers  open market purchase programs or other purchases of our ordinary shares that could give our shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our ordinary shares 

table of contents it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process and enforce judgments obtained in united states courts against us or our directors and executive officers who reside outside of the united states 
we are incorporated in the british virgin islands 
several of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states  and a majority of our assets are located outside the united states 
as a result  we have been advised by legal counsel in the british virgin islands that it may be difficult or impossible for our shareholders to effect service of process upon  or to enforce judgments obtained in united states courts against  us or our directors and executive officers  including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
because we are incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands  it may be more difficult for our shareholders to protect their rights than it would be for a shareholder of a corporation incorporated in another jurisdiction 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the international business companies act cap of the british virgin islands 
principles of law relating to such matters as the validity of corporate procedures  the fiduciary duties of management and the rights of our shareholders may differ from those that would apply if we were incorporated in the united states or another jurisdiction 
the rights of shareholders under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as are the rights of shareholders in many other jurisdictions 
thus  you may have more difficulty protecting your interests in the face of actions by our board of directors or our principal shareholders than you would have as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in another jurisdiction 
future issuances of preference shares could adversely affect the holders of our ordinary shares 
we are authorized to issue up to  preference shares  of which  have been designated as class a preference shares and  have been designated as class b preference shares 
our board of directors may determine the rights and preferences of the class a and class b preference shares within the limits set forth in our memorandum and articles of association and applicable law 
among other rights  our board of directors may determine  without further vote or action by our shareholders  the dividend  voting  conversion  redemption and liquidation rights of our preference shares 
our board of directors may also amend our memorandum and articles of association to create from time to time one or more classes of preference shares 
the issuance of any preference shares could adversely affect the rights of the holders of ordinary shares  and therefore reduce the value of the ordinary shares 
while currently no preference shares are outstanding  no assurance can be made that we will not issue preference shares in the future 
our memorandum and articles of association contain anti takeover provisions which may discourage attempts by others to acquire or merge with us and which could reduce the market value of our ordinary shares 
provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire or merge with us  which could reduce the market value of our ordinary shares 
provisions in our memorandum and articles of association may delay  deter or prevent other persons from attempting to acquire control of us 
these provisions include the authorization of our board of directors to issue preference shares with such rights and preferences determined by the board  without the specific approval of the holders of ordinary shares  our board of directors is divided into three classes each of which is elected in a different year  the prohibition of action by the written consent of the shareholders  the establishment of advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at shareholder meetings  and 
table of contents the requirement that the holders of two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at a meeting are required to approve changes to specific provisions of our memorandum and articles of association including those provisions described above and others which are designed to discourage non negotiated takeover attempts 
in addition  our memorandum and articles of association permit special meetings of the shareholders to be called only by our chief executive officer or our board of directors upon request by a majority of our directors or the written request of holders of more than percent of our outstanding voting securities 
provisions of british virgin islands law to which we are subject could substantially impede the ability of our shareholders to benefit from a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us  discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us  and impede the ability of our shareholders to change our management and board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative information about market risk foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity our use of derivative financial instruments is limited to forward foreign exchange contracts 
at january   the notional value of all of our open forward foreign exchange contracts was million related to transactions denominated in various currencies  but predominantly in us dollars  euros and british pounds sterling 
these contracts are generally entered into at the time the foreign currency exposure is incurred and do not exceed days 
the following tables provide comparable information about our non functional currency components of balance sheet items by currency  and present such information in us dollar equivalents at january  and these tables summarize information on transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed in foreign currency is then subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency 
non functional currency exposure in us dollar equivalents is as follows in thousands foreign exchange gain loss if functional currency net exposure appreciates depreciates non functional currency assets liabilities long short by by at january  us dollars euro british pounds sterling hong kong dollars other total at january  us dollars euro british pounds sterling hong kong dollars other total 
table of contents qualitative information about market risk foreign exchange risk the nature of our operations necessitates dealing in many foreign currencies 
our results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions 
we provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  operate with many currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  africa  asia pacific and europe 
our short term exposures to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through our use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles all of our intercompany trading obligations once per month 
in addition  selected exposures are managed by financial market transactions in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities at the end of the month following the purchase of the contract 
forward foreign exchange contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of our principal markets 
we will normally generate foreign exchange gains and losses through normal trading operations 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 
interest rate risk we are subject to changing interest rates because our debt consists primarily of short term working capital lines 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
market rate risk the fair value of our long term bank loans approximates the carrying value at january  and market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates and was not considered material at either year end
