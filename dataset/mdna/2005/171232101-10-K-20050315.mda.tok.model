critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for those transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the adequacy of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables  the fair value of future obligations under financial products contracts and the recoverability of the carrying value of real estate properties 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 
executive summary the following highlights do not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or contain all of the information that may be important to the corporation s shareholders or the investing public 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was  million in compared with million in and million in premium growth was in and in rate increases were substantial in rates continued to increase in however  as expected  the level of rate increases declined in each succeeding quarter 
our combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in our underwriting results were adversely affected by asbestos and toxic waste losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our combined loss and expense ratio  excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  was in  in and in during  we experienced overall unfavorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end  due primarily to unfavorable development in our executive protection classes  principally directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability  resulting from adverse loss trends in accident years through related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
we reached an agreement in july with respect to gas forward purchase surety bonds issued for aquila that resulted in aquila providing us with collateral sufficient to cover our entire million exposure under the bonds 
property and casualty investment income after taxes increased by in compared with growth of in the non insurance business of chubb financial solutions cfs produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in as announced in april  we are exiting this business and are running off the financial products portfolio of cfs 
we reduced our aggregate notional exposure by billion during to approximately billion at year end 
a summary of our consolidated net income is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance chubb financial solutions non insurance business corporate and other realized investment gains consolidated income before income tax federal and foreign income tax credit consolidated net income net income included realized investment gains after tax of million in  million in and million in decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized gains and losses on the sale of investments may vary significantly from period to period 
property and casualty insurance a summary of the results of operations of our property and casualty insurance business is as follows years ended december in millions underwriting net premiums written increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income loss investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other charges property and casualty income before tax property and casualty investment income after tax the growth in property and casualty earnings in and was due primarily to a substantial improvement in underwriting results 
earnings in both years also benefited from a significant increase in investment income 
our property and casualty underwriting results in  and were adversely affected by incurred losses of million  million and million  respectively  related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  property and casualty earnings in were substantially higher than in  which in turn were significantly higher than in the profitability of the property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both underwriting operations and investments 
we view these as two distinct operations 
the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results 
underwriting operations we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our three separate business units personal insurance  commercial insurance and specialty insurance 
the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business 
management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of our underwriting operations 
to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income loss determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 
underwriting results net premiums written net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of over net premiums written increased in compared with over of our premiums are written in the united states 
premium growth in the us was in and in us premium growth in and benefited from the weakness of the us dollar 
on a reported basis  non us premiums grew in and in in local currencies  such growth was and in and  respectively 
net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance executive protection financial institutions other total specialty total premium growth in and occurred in all segments of our business 
in  growth was particularly strong in the commercial and specialty classes due primarily to higher rates 
in  premium growth was largely the result of our retaining a higher percentage of our existing customers and attracting new customers 
we continued to get rate increases on much of the business we wrote  although the size of such increases decelerated throughout the year 
we expect that pricing pressure will continue in in this environment  we will continue to stress underwriting discipline 
premium growth in our other specialty insurance business in both years was primarily in our reinsurance assumed business generated by chubb re 
reinsurance our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers who assume a portion of the risk under the insurance policies that are subject to the reinsurance 
after several years of significant price increases  the cost of reinsurance in the marketplace has leveled off 
however  reinsurance capacity for certain coverages  such as terrorism  continues to be limited and expensive 
our reinsurance program was similar to that in reinsurance costs increased in line with the higher premiums on the policies reinsured 
we discontinued some lower limit treaties that we believed were no longer economical and increased our participation in certain layers of the treaties that we did renew 
our property reinsurance program renews each april 
at the renewal  our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase the reinsurance coverage at the top due to our increased exposure in certain catastrophe exposed areas 
our reinsurance costs in were similar to those in we discontinued a casualty per risk treaty that responded primarily to excess liability exposures over million 
underwriting actions we have taken in recent years have resulted in a reduction in the number of such exposures  which we believe made this treaty no longer economical 
our executive protection per risk treaty was renewed with coverage similar to the prior year 
on our property per risk treaty  our retention remained at million 
our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase our initial retention and to increase the reinsurance coverage at the top 
the program now provides coverage of approximately of losses between million and billion  with additional coverage of of losses between billion and billion in the northeastern part of the country 
our property reinsurance treaties generally contain terrorism exclusions 
we expect our reinsurance costs in to be less than those in in january  we discontinued our executive protection per risk treaty 
underwriting actions we have taken in recent years have resulted in lower average limits on those large risks we write  which we believe made this treaty no longer economical 
on our casualty clash treaty  which operates like a catastrophe treaty  we increased our retention from million to million 
this treaty now provides million of coverage in excess of million per insured event 
we did not renew a high excess surety per risk treaty as we believe the cost was not justified 
profitability underwriting results were highly profitable in compared with modestly profitable results in and unprofitable results in the combined loss and expense ratio for our overall property and casualty insurance business was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio underwriting results in  and were adversely affected by incurred losses of million  million and million  respectively  related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
asbestos and toxic waste losses are a significant component in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our property and casualty insurance business 
however  notwithstanding the significance of asbestos and toxic waste losses  the magnitude of such losses  particularly in  makes it difficult to assess the underlying trends in our property and casualty insurance business 
excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  the combined loss and expense ratio was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio underwriting results  excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  were substantially more profitable in than in such results in were more profitable than in the loss ratio  excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  improved in and improved further in  reflecting the favorable experience resulting from our disciplined underwriting standards in recent years 
the improvement in was achieved despite higher catastrophe losses compared with the prior year 
losses from catastrophes were million in  which represented percentage points of the loss ratio  compared with million or percentage points in and million or percentage points in the catastrophe loss amount excludes an million reduction in loss reserves related to the september  attack  which reduced the loss ratio for the year by of a percentage point 
we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during the three year period since there were no individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
our initial retention level for each catastrophic event in the united states was increased from million to million during our initial retention is generally million outside the united states 
our expense ratio improved in and again in the lower expense ratio in was due in large part to premiums written growing at a substantially higher rate than overhead expenses and was achieved despite an approximate of a percentage point adverse impact of our decision to expense stock options for the first time 
the improvement in was due to premiums written growing at a higher rate than overhead expenses  as we made continued progress in reducing our expense structure  and to lower contingent commission expense 
the decrease in contingent commissions in was due to two factors that reduced producer compensation 
first  we did not pay contingent commissions in the fourth quarter to those large brokers who elected to terminate such arrangements before year end see producer compensation 
second  the slowdown of premium growth in the second half of the year resulted in lower compensation to other producers whose commissions  in part  are contingent on the volume of business placed with us 
asbestos and toxic waste losses 
in october  our actuaries and outside actuarial consultants completed their periodic ground up exposure based analysis of our asbestos related exposures 
upon completion of the analysis and assessment of the results  we increased our net loss reserves by million in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our previous estimate of reinsurance recoverable on potential asbestos claims  resulting in an additional increase in our net loss reserves of million 
prior to the completion of the analysis  we had incurred asbestos and toxic waste net losses of million in the first half of in the fourth quarter of  our actuaries and outside actuarial consultants performed a rigorous update of the ground up analysis of our asbestos related exposures 
upon completion of the update  we increased our net loss reserves by million 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased our net loss reserves related to asbestos claims by million based on an internal analysis that was confirmed by a rollforward review by our outside actuarial consultants 
our asbestos and toxic waste exposure is further discussed under loss reserves 
review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums from personal insurance  which represent of the premiums written by our property and casualty subsidiaries  increased by in compared with a increase in growth in slowed somewhat from levels due to a slowing in the pace of rate increases 
in both and  premium growth occurred in all classes 
the premium growth in our homeowners business was due to increased insurance to value and  to a lesser extent  higher rates 
the in force policy count for this class had minimal growth in both years 
our personal insurance business produced more profitable underwriting results in compared with the results in and the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december automobile homeowners other total personal homeowners results were profitable in compared with unprofitable results in and the improvement in was largely the result of better pricing and a reduction in water damage losses primarily through the implementation of contract wording changes related to mold damage 
results in and were similar as higher catastrophe losses in were offset by a decline in fire and water damage losses and the impact of improved pricing 
results in were adversely affected by an increase in the severity of water damage claims  including those related to mold  particularly in texas 
losses from catastrophes represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in our remediation plan relating to our homeowners business in the united states  which began in the latter part of  is on track 
we have implemented rate increases in many states 
in addition  we have made regulatory filings in most states to introduce contract changes that would enable us to treat mold as a separate peril available at an appropriate price 
these changes  which have been implemented in states  have begun to reduce the severity of our water damage losses  particularly in texas  the state in which these losses have been most significant 
our personal automobile results were more profitable in compared with and the improvement in was due to lower claim frequency and stable loss severity as well as modest rate increases 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuable articles  excess liability and yacht  produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years  as favorable loss experience has continued 
commercial insurance net premiums from commercial insurance  which represent of our total writings  increased by in compared with a increase in growth occurred in all segments of this business but was particularly strong in the workers compensation and casualty classes 
the premium growth was due in large part to higher rates as well as an increase in our in force policy count 
rates increased substantially in as expected  the level of rate increases declined throughout as we experienced more competition in the marketplace  particularly in the property classes 
retention levels remained steady during and were somewhat higher in new business was strong in each of the past three years  but was down in from levels due to a decrease in submission activity 
we continue to get favorable terms and conditions on business written 
our commercial insurance business produced highly profitable underwriting results in compared with profitable results in and highly unprofitable results in the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within commercial insurance were as follows years ended december multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial our commercial insurance results were adversely affected by incurred losses of million in  million in and million in related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  the combined loss and expense ratios were as follows years ended december multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  our commercial insurance underwriting results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results have shown substantial improvement in each succeeding year 
the improvement has been due in large part to the cumulative effect of price increases  better terms and conditions and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
results in were exceptionally profitable due in part to unusually low property losses 
multiple peril results were highly profitable in and  but more so in  whereas results in were near breakeven 
both the property and liability components of this business contributed to the improvement in the property component was exceptionally profitable in due to unusually low losses 
the improvement in was driven by the property component where earned premiums grew significantly while incurred losses were flat compared with the prior year 
losses from catastrophes represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in casualty results in each of the past three years were adversely affected by asbestos and toxic waste losses 
excluding the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  casualty results were highly profitable in each of the past three years due to price increases over the last several years and favorable loss experience 
the automobile and primary liability components of this business produced highly profitable results in all three years 
the excess liability component was profitable in compared with near breakeven results in and results in benefited from a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
workers compensation results were similarly profitable in each of the past three years due in large part to our disciplined risk selection during the past several years 
property and marine results were highly profitable in each of the past three years  particularly in due in part to unusually low losses 
results in each year benefited from improved pricing  higher deductibles  better terms and conditions and a low number of severe losses 
the strong results in were achieved despite a million loss that resulted from an adverse arbitration decision rendered against an insurance pool in which we were formerly a participant 
the decision related to a fire that occurred in losses from catastrophes represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in specialty insurance net premiums from specialty insurance  which represent of our total writings  increased by in compared with a increase in as discussed below  growth in both years was enhanced by the growth in our reinsurance assumed business produced by chubb re 
excluding chubb re premiums  our specialty premiums increased by in and in in response to claim severity trends in our executive protection business and the professional liability component of our financial institutions business  we initiated a program in the latter half of to increase pricing and improve policy terms and to not renew business that did not meet our underwriting criteria 
we implemented tighter terms and conditions  including lower policy limits and higher deductibles 
we have reprofiled our book of business  generating most of our new business from small and middle market customers 
premium growth in for this business was primarily attributable to higher rates 
rate increases moderated during the latter half of and throughout due to increased competition in the marketplace 
rates in the for profit directors and officers liability component were down in we obtained modest rate increases in most other classes 
premium growth in was constrained by the competitive pressure on rates and our commitment to maintain underwriting discipline 
new business in was similar to levels 
retention levels were significantly higher in compared with the prior year 
we continued to get favorable terms and conditions on both renewals and new business 
in the fidelity and standard commercial components of our financial institutions business  we saw a similar moderation of rate increases in the latter half of and throughout growth in our other specialty insurance business was primarily in our reinsurance assumed business 
we write only treaty reinsurance  primarily casualty reinsurance 
premiums produced by chubb re amounted to  million in compared with million in and million in we expect reinsurance assumed premiums to decrease substantially in as we anticipate fewer attractive opportunities in the reinsurance market 
our specialty insurance business produced breakeven underwriting results in and compared with modestly unprofitable results in the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance were as follows years ended december executive protection financial institutions other total specialty executive protection results were unprofitable in each of the past three years but improved in and again in results in each year were adversely affected by directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claim experience  predominantly from claims that have arisen due to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
results improved in compared with due to the impact of higher premiums 
results in were particularly unprofitable due to deteriorating loss trends in our european operations caused by an increase in litigation  often involving european companies listed on us exchanges being sued in us courts for securities fraud 
our financial institutions business produced highly unprofitable results in each of the past three years  particularly in the deterioration in was in the professional liability component of this business 
results for the professional liability component were highly unprofitable in all three years due to the same adverse directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claim trends experienced in our executive protection business 
results were particularly unprofitable in due to an increase of about million in errors and omissions liability loss reserves in the second quarter related to investment banks 
financial institutions continue to be the focus of scrutiny by regulators and the plaintiffs bar related to investment banking and mutual fund scandals 
the fidelity component of this business was highly profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
the standard commercial business written on financial institutions produced profitable results in all three years  reflecting the rate increases and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
such results were highly profitable in due to a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
other specialty results were highly profitable in all three years 
our reinsurance assumed business generated by chubb re and our accident business were each profitable in all three years 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years  particularly in results in benefited from an million reduction in net loss reserves resulting from the settlement of litigation related to enron corp 
our surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses 
since the end of  we have been reducing our exposure on an absolute basis and by specific bond type 
the majority of our obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
when losses occur  they are mitigated  at times  by the customer s balance sheet  contract proceeds and bankruptcy recovery 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage and reduce our surety exposure  we continue to have substantial commercial surety exposure for outstanding bonds 
in that regard  we have exposures related to commercial surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses 
such losses would be recognized if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and liquidity 
at december   we had in force million of gas forward purchase surety bonds with one principal  aquila 
these surety bonds secured aquila s obligation to supply gas under long term forward purchase agreements 
in july  a settlement was reached and approved by the court that resulted in aquila providing us with collateral sufficient to cover our entire exposure under the surety bonds 
our cost under this agreement was million 
a property and casualty subsidiary issued a reinsurance contract to an insurer who provides financial guarantees on debt obligations 
at december   the amount of aggregate principal commitments related to this contract was approximately million  net of reinsurance 
these commitments expire by producer compensation we have agreements in place with insurance brokers under which we agree to pay commissions that are contingent on the volume and or the profitability of business placed with us 
we also have in place contingent commission arrangements with agents who are appointed by us to sell our insurance 
the new york attorney general and other regulators have raised issues with respect to potential conflicts of interest arising from the payment of contingent commissions to brokers 
in response  several brokers and some agents have announced that they are eliminating the practice of receiving contingent compensation from insurers 
in addition  several state insurance regulators have announced that they are looking at compensation arrangements for brokers and agents and considering regulatory reform in this area 
we will continue to monitor this situation and our compensation arrangements with agents and brokers and will amend such arrangements  as necessary  so that they are consistent with evolving standards in this area 
although announced decisions by brokers and proposals by regulators may change the manner in which insurance intermediaries are compensated  we expect that total producer compensation in will be at about levels 
catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other natural catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe exposed areas globally and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  we have invested in modeling technologies and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses from catastrophe exposures 
we maintain records showing concentrations of risk in catastrophe exposed areas such as california earthquake and brush fires and the gulf and east coasts of the united states hurricanes 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the tragic event of september  changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
numerous classes of business have become exposed to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have purchased a terrorism model with more specific probable loss scenarios that allow us to better identify locations with large accumulation of limits 
with the information provided by this tool  we may non renew some accounts and be restricted in writing others 
however  the model is new and relatively untested 
therefore  results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
since september  we have changed our underwriting protocols to address terrorism and the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance 
however  given the uncertainty of the potential threats  we cannot be sure that we have addressed all the possibilities 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria was signed into law on november  tria established a temporary program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from certain acts of international terrorism with the insurance industry 
the program terminates on december  tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of insurance 
insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program 
each insurer has a separate deductible in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct commercial earned premiums from the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct commercial earned premiums in for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer contributes 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion  above this amount  insurers are not liable for covered losses 
for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism coverage is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  insureds may choose not to accept the terrorism coverage  which would reduce our exposure 
while the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating million in it is unclear at this time whether congress will reauthorize tria for periods subsequent to december  regardless of whether or not tria is extended  we will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring and controlling terrorism risk aggregations 
nevertheless  given the unpredictable nature of terrorism  its targets  frequency and severity as well as the limited terrorism coverage in our reinsurance program  our future operating results could be more volatile 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
loss reserves unpaid losses and loss expenses  also referred to as loss reserves  are the largest liability of our property and casualty subsidiaries 
our loss reserves include the accumulation of individual case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported as well as estimates of the expenses associated with settling all reported and unreported claims 
estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
we continually review our loss reserves using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques 
we update the reserves as loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
our loss reserves include significant amounts related to asbestos and toxic waste claims and the september attack 
the components of our loss reserves were as follows december in millions gross loss reserves related to asbestos and toxic waste claims related to september attack all other loss reserves reinsurance recoverable related to asbestos and toxic waste claims related to september attack all other reinsurance recoverable net loss reserves loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by billion or in compared with billion or in the loss reserves related to asbestos and toxic waste claims and the september attack are significant components of our total loss reserves  but they distort the growth trend in our loss reserves 
excluding such loss reserves  our loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by billion or in compared with billion or in the components of our net loss reserves were as follows december in millions reserves related to asbestos and toxic waste claims reserves related to september attack all other loss reserves personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance net loss reserves loss reserves for each of our business segments increased significantly in and again in the increase was most significant in specialty insurance  due in large part to directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claim activity as well as the strong growth in our reinsurance assumed business 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves of our property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos claims and  to a lesser extent  toxic waste claims  it is possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may increase in future periods 
such increases in estimates could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s future operating results 
however  management does not expect that any such increases would have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
due to the uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process and the complexity of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly when settlements may not occur until well into the future 
a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on the corporation s operating results 
for example  a hypothetical increase in net loss reserves at december  would have resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million 
we analyze loss reserves in two categories reserves relating to all claims other than asbestos and toxic waste claims and reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
reserves relating to claims other than asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  the estimation of loss reserves is less complex because claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims relate to tangible property 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other executive protection coverages  commercial excess liability  and other liability coverages 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
for the long tail liability classes  a relatively small proportion of losses in the more recent accident years relate to reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of estimation error 
most of our reinsurance assumed business is long tailed casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company 
a relatively large proportion of our net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes  are reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
in fact  approximately of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr 
we review the loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write as part of our overall analysis of loss reserves  taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
in performing these reviews  our actuaries use a variety of complex actuarial methods that analyze experience trends and other relevant factors 
these methods generally utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year by class of business 
this process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
for certain long tail classes of business where anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns  estimates are based on both expected losses and actual reported losses 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  we judgmentally set ultimate losses for each accident year based on our evaluation of loss trends and the current risk environment 
the expected ultimate losses are adjusted as the accident years mature 
using the various complex actuarial methods and different underlying assumptions  our actuaries produce a number of point estimates for each class of business 
after reviewing the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions  management selects the carried reserve for each class of business 
we do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates 
ranges are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due to the fact that ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
among the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves are the following changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  legislative actions including the impact of the class action fairness act of  changes in the medical condition of claimants  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  changes in our underwriting standards  and any changes in our claim handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues 
these issues can have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include increases in the number and size of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance and increases in the number and size of water damage claims related to remediation of mold conditions 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have become increasingly unpredictable  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
the future impact of the various factors described above that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process and of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is extremely hard to predict and cannot be quantified 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
instead  we rely on an exposure based analysis that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  we generally evaluate our exposure on a policyholder by policyholder basis  considering a variety of factors that are unique to each policyholder 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management judgment 
it is therefore not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and toxic waste claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims 
such development will be affected by the extent to which courts and legislatures continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance companies over many years and increases their exposure to liability 
the plaintiffs bar continues to solicit new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
litigation is then initiated even though a vast majority of the new claimants do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
thus  new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued unabated despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
we expect that we will continue to receive a significant number of new asbestos claims for at least the next several years 
to date  approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities 
in the past  bankruptcies generally were filed by companies with no financial alternative 
a recent disturbing development is an increase in prepackaged bankruptcies  which are designed to circumvent the normal bankruptcy process 
a prepackaged bankruptcy involves a pre filing agreement to a plan between the debtor and its creditors  including current and future asbestos claimants 
although the debtor is negotiating in part with its insurers money  insurers are not given the opportunity to participate in the negotiations 
prepackaged bankruptcies also accelerate payments by insurers compared with the tort system 
we are actively engaged  as part of industry coalitions  in challenging these prepackaged bankruptcies where appropriate 
a few recent federal court decisions have expressed skepticism about the propriety of this device 
we are monitoring these developments 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve products liability on the part of traditional defendants who were engaged in the manufacture  distribution or installation of asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  such exposure has increased in recent years due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve products and non products liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners or operators of properties where asbestos was present 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for larger awards 
asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s liability 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits  creating potentially greater exposure for insurers 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
therefore  the future impact of such efforts on insurers is uncertain 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  potential bankruptcy impact  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
we have assumed a continuing unfavorable legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
we believe that enactment of any legislation in the next couple of years is highly unlikely as there appear to be irreconcilable differences among the various parties regarding claim values  medical criteria and allocation 
in the third quarter of  our actuaries and claim personnel  together with our outside actuarial consultants  commenced their periodic ground up exposure based analysis of our asbestos related exposures 
as part of this analysis  they considered the following adverse trends estimates of the ultimate liabilities for traditional asbestos defendants had increased as the number of claims had surged over the past few years 
the notable increase in claimants as well as potential future claimants had resulted in large settlements of asbestos related litigation 
as a result  it appeared more likely that many of these traditional defendants would access higher excess layers of insurance coverage as well as more years of coverage than previously anticipated 
claims had been more aggressively pursued against peripheral asbestos defendants in recent years  partly in response to the bankruptcy or exhaustion of insurance coverage for many of the major traditional defendants 
the number of claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies had increased  creating potentially greater exposure 
the litigation environment had become increasingly adverse 
the number of asbestos defendants in bankruptcy had increased  resulting in an increase in the number and cost of declaratory judgment lawsuits to resolve coverage disputes and to effect settlements in the bankruptcy courts 
upon completion of the analysis and assessment of the results  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in the third quarter of following a thorough review in the fourth quarter by our internal actuarial  claims and reinsurance personnel  we reduced our estimate of reinsurance recoverable on potential asbestos claims 
as a result  our net asbestos loss reserves increased by an additional million 
in the fourth quarter of  our actuaries and claim personnel  together with our outside actuarial consultants  performed a rigorous update of their ground up analysis of our asbestos related exposures 
the review noted the same adverse trends observed during the analysis  particularly a further increase in estimates of the ultimate liabilities for several of our traditional asbestos defendants 
in addition  the number of peripheral asbestos defendants for whom we established reserves and the average severity of these claims were both higher than anticipated 
upon completion of the update  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million 
in the fourth quarter of  our actuaries and claim personnel performed an analysis of our asbestos related exposures 
the analysis noted that both the number of peripheral asbestos defendants for whom we established reserves and the average severity of these claims were again somewhat higher than expected 
in addition  there was an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for one of our traditional asbestos defendants 
based on our analysis  which was confirmed by a rollforward review by our outside actuarial consultants  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims

number of net loss net losses policyholders reserves paid in millions traditional defendants peripheral defendants future claims from unknown policyholders significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to several factors including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  the increase in the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs  claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies  the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the impact of prepackaged bankruptcies  diverging legal interpretations  and the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up at a hazardous waste site  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
the prps disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically excluded such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up became substantial  prps and others increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability is shifting to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
in a few states  we are seeing cases brought against insureds or directly against insurance companies for environmental pollution and natural resources damages 
to date  only a few natural resource claims have been filed and they are being vigorously defended 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider the probable liability  available insurance coverage  past settlement values of similar exposures as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to toxic waste claims 
however  toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to more efficient site remediation efforts 
in other cases  we have been successful at buying back our policies 
despite the stable claim trends  we increased our toxic waste loss reserves by million in the third quarter of based on the estimate of our actuaries and actuarial consultants as to our ultimate exposure 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
there are virtually no reinsurance recoveries related to these claims 
years ended december in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses net losses paid net loss reserves  end of year of the net toxic waste loss reserves at december   million was for ibnr losses 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable is the estimated amount recoverable from reinsurers related to the losses we have incurred 
at december   reinsurance recoverable included million recoverable with respect to paid losses and loss expenses  which is included in other assets  and billion recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses represents an estimate of the portion of our gross loss reserves that will be recovered from reinsurers 
such reinsurance recoverable is estimated as part of our loss reserving process using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the gross loss reserves 
consequently  the estimation of reinsurance recoverable is subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves 
a credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers with strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability  and we monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
as a result  uncollectible amounts have not been significant 
a provision for estimated uncollectible reinsurance is recorded based on an evaluation of balances due from reinsurers and other available information 
prior year loss development because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for the three years ended december  is as follows in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses related to current year prior years net loss payments related to current year prior years net loss reserves  end of year during  we experienced overall unfavorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with unfavorable one year development of million and million in and  respectively 
such adverse development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 
the net unfavorable development of million in was the result of various positive and negative factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced adverse development of about million in the executive protection classes  principally directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability  resulting from adverse loss trends in accident years through due in large part to claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities  especially those involving investment banks and other financial institutions 
in particular  in the second quarter of  we updated our analysis of our exposure to investment banking errors and omissions claims related to report years and prior 
these claims pertain principally to allegations against investment banks of laddering or of aiding and abetting in certain of the high profile corporate abuse cases 
during the quarter  the last of the significant regulatory settlements was announced  clearing the way for intensified and accelerated attention to the class action litigation that drives our exposure 
in addition  recent developments in litigation relating to various corporate abuse scandals have led a number of investment banks to focus on  and in some cases pursue vigorously  settlement strategies 
these developments and other information about potential settlement ranges and allocations of responsibility among investment banks for which we were one of the insurers were considered as part of the analysis of our exposure that led to our decision to increase net loss reserves by about million in the quarter 
we experienced adverse development of about million related to accident years prior to  due largely to our strengthening loss reserves for asbestos and other liability claims 
we experienced adverse development of about million in the workers compensation class due primarily to higher average severity of the medical portion of these claims 
we experienced favorable development of about million related to the accident year  due in large part to an unusually low amount of late reported homeowners and commercial property losses 
we experienced favorable development of million due to a reduction of net loss reserves in the second quarter related to the september attack as a result of several developments 
in march  the deadline for filing a liability claim with respect to the september attack expired 
that enabled us to define more precisely the number of claimants under liability policies 
then  in june  the final award determinations for claimants of the world trade center victims compensation fund were made 
as for our property exposure  in april  the jury in the silverstein case found that we had bound coverage under a policy form that defined the september attack as one occurrence 
the effect of that verdict was to eliminate the need for us to make any additional payment 
while an appeal has been filed  we believe that it has no merit 
the unfavorable development in was due primarily to two factors 
first  we strengthened asbestos loss reserves by million in the fourth quarter 
second  we experienced unfavorable development of about million in our executive protection classes  principally directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability  as adverse loss trends in the most recent accident years more than offset favorable loss experience in older accident years 
the unfavorable development in was due primarily to our strengthening asbestos and toxic waste loss reserves by million during the year 
in addition  we experienced unfavorable development of about million in the homeowners class due to the increase in the severity of water damage and related mold claims 
in the executive protection classes  adverse loss trends in europe and the united states in the more recent accident years more than offset favorable loss experience in the united states in older accident years  resulting in unfavorable development of about million during the year 
we experienced favorable development of million due to the reduction in net surety loss reserves resulting from the enron settlement 
in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by in compared with and by in compared with growth in both years was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
growth in both years also benefited from an million capital contribution to the property and casualty subsidiaries by the corporation in the second quarter of growth in benefited from a similar capital contribution of billion in the fourth quarter of growth in investment income in both years was dampened by lower available reinvestment rates on fixed maturities that matured 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate fluctuated as the result of our holding a different proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities during each year 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and in management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 
other charges other charges include miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries 
other charges in included expenses of million related to the restructuring of our operations in continental europe 
the restructuring costs consisted primarily of severance costs related to branch closings and work force reductions 
chubb financial solutions chubb financial solutions cfs was organized in to develop and provide customized products to address specific financial needs of corporate clients 
cfs operated through both the capital and insurance markets 
the insurance and reinsurance solutions were written by our property and casualty subsidiaries  and the results of such business are included within our underwriting results 
in april  the corporation announced its intention to exit cfs s non insurance business and to run off the existing financial products portfolio 
our objective is to exit this business as quickly as possible while minimizing the potential of a large payment due to an unexpected credit event over the next few years 
cfs s non insurance business was primarily structured credit derivatives  principally as a counterparty in portfolio credit default swap contracts 
the corporation guaranteed all of these obligations 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  cfs participated in the senior layer of a structure designed to replicate the performance of a portfolio of corporate securities  a portfolio of asset backed securities or a specified pool of loans 
the structure of these portfolio credit default swaps generally requires cfs to make payment to counterparties to the extent cumulative losses  related to numerous credit events  exceed a specified threshold 
the risk below that threshold  referred to as subordination  is assumed by other parties with the primary risk layer sometimes retained by the buyer 
credit events generally arise when one of the referenced entities within a portfolio becomes bankrupt  undergoes a debt restructuring or fails to make timely interest or principal payments 
portfolio credit default swaps are derivatives and are carried in the financial statements at estimated fair value  which represents management s best estimate of the cost to exit our positions 
most of these credit default swaps tend to be unique transactions and there is no market for trading such exposures 
to estimate the fair value of the obligation in each credit default swap  we use internal valuation models that are similar to external valuation models 
the fair value of our credit default swaps is subject to fluctuations arising from  among other factors  changes in credit spreads  the financial ratings of referenced asset backed securities  actual credit events reducing subordination  credit correlation within a portfolio  anticipated recovery rates related to potential defaults and changes in interest rates 
changes in fair value are included in income in the period of the change 
thus  cfs s results have been subject to volatility  which has had a significant effect on the corporation s results of operations from period to period 
the non insurance business of cfs produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in the loss in was due to adverse movement in the mark to market adjustment  which resulted in an increase in the fair value of our future obligations related to the portfolio credit default swaps 
of the increase in the fair value of our obligations  million was due to downgrades in the financial ratings of certain referenced securities underlying two of our asset backed portfolio credit default swaps 
other factors contributing to the increase were a widening of market credit spreads and  for one credit default swap  erosion in the risk layers that are subordinate to the cfs risk layer due to actual losses in those subordinate layers 
the substantial loss in was due to further deterioration in the credit quality of certain referenced securities underlying the two asset backed credit default swaps 
in the first nine months of the year  the fair value of our obligations related to these two swaps increased by million 
then  in the fourth quarter  as described below  we terminated the two swaps and replaced them with a principal and interest guarantee agreement  which resulted in an additional loss of million 
the losses related to these two asset backed swaps were partially offset by mark to market gains during the year on our corporate credit default swaps 
the loss in was primarily due to the termination during the year of cfs s obligations under certain portfolio credit default swaps 
revenues from the non insurance business of cfs  primarily consisting of the change in fair value of derivatives contracts  were negative million in  negative million in and negative million in revenues were negative in due to the termination of several portfolio credit default swaps 
revenues were negative in and due to the adverse impact of changes in fair value and  in  the impact of the agreement to terminate the two asset backed portfolio credit default swaps and replace them with a principal and interest guarantee 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from each of its in force portfolio credit default swaps is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions 
these amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
at december   the notional amount of cfs s credit default swaps was approximately billion  of which billion related to the two asset backed swaps that had experienced deterioration in credit quality 
in connection with our plan to exit the credit derivatives business  we accelerated the reduction of our notional exposure 
in the fourth quarter of  cfs paid million to terminate the two asset backed portfolio credit default swaps that had experienced deterioration in credit quality and simultaneously entered into a new contract that guaranteed principal and interest obligations on only billion of the original billion notional amount 
at december   the remaining notional amount of referenced securities was billion 
the corporation has guaranteed cfs s obligations under the new contract 
cfs s potential payment obligations have been extended from the original termination dates of and to the date when the last of the underlying obligations expire 
under the new agreement  cfs s maximum payment obligation is limited to million regardless of the amount of losses that might be incurred on the billion of referenced securities 
moreover  if losses are incurred  cfs s payment obligations are limited to an extended payment schedule under which no payment would be due until at the earliest 
cfs established a liability of million related to the new principal and interest contract  which represented the estimated fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
at the same time  cfs eliminated the carried liability of million on the two swaps that were terminated 
the principal and interest guarantee is not a derivative contract 
therefore  the liability related to this contract is not being marked to market each period and remained at million at december  due to the nature of the guarantee  we will reduce this liability only upon either the expiration or settlement of the guarantee 
if actual losses are incurred  a liability for the losses will be established  and a portion of the guarantee liability will be released 
the amount released will depend on our evaluation of expected ultimate loss experience 
during and  cfs terminated certain other portfolio credit default swaps with the original counterparties at negotiated settlement amounts 
cfs also entered into credit default swaps with third parties that effectively offset existing credit default swaps 
as of december   the notional amount of such offsetting credit default swaps was approximately billion 
as a result of these transactions  the notional amount of cfs s credit default swaps was reduced to billion at december  and further reduced to billion at december  our realistic loss exposure is a very small portion of the billion notional amount due to several factors 
our position is senior to subordinated interests of billion in the aggregate 
of the billion of subordination  there were only million of defaults through december   none of which has pierced the subordination limit of any individual contract 
in addition  using our internal ratings models  we estimate that the credit ratings of the individual portfolio credit default swaps at december  were either aaa or aa 
in addition to portfolio credit default swaps  cfs entered into a derivative contract linked to an equity market index and a few other insignificant non insurance transactions 
the notional amount and fair value of our future obligations under derivative contracts by type of risk were as follows december notional amount fair value in billions in millions credit default swaps corporate securities asset backed securities loan portfolios other corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries 
it also includes income from our investment in allied world assurance company  ltd 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
corporate and other results were similar in and as higher investment income in was substantially offset by a larger loss from our real estate operations 
investment income was higher in due to an increase in corporate invested assets resulting primarily from the issuance of debt and equity securities during the higher loss in compared with was due to an increase in interest expense and a decrease in investment income 
interest expense increased in due to the issuance of million of debt in the fourth quarter of  million of debt in the first quarter of and million of debt in the second quarter of the decrease in investment income in was due to lower average corporate invested assets resulting from the capital contributions to the property and casualty subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of in both and  corporate and other results included a loss at the chubb institute  inc  our post secondary educational subsidiary 
in each year  the effect of this loss was substantially offset by income from our investment in allied world 
as part of our focus on our core insurance business  we sold the chubb institute in september the sale transaction is further discussed under realized investment gains and losses 
real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in these amounts are included in the corporate and other results 
the higher loss in was due primarily to the recognition of impairment losses on two commercial properties 
in each year  we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in we own approximately million of land that we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  our real estate assets include approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease  of which million relates to a variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
the recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the assumptions used reflect future improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed or if leased properties do not perform as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized that would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
realized investment gains and losses net investment gains realized were as follows years ended december in millions net realized gains losses on sales equity securities fixed maturities chubb institute other than temporary impairment equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax of the net realized gains on sales of equity securities  million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to our share of gains recognized by investment partnerships in which we have an interest 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
in may  we entered into an agreement to sell the chubb institute 
the sale closed in september 
under the final terms of the sale  we recognized a loss of million 
we regularly review those invested assets whose fair value is less than cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
in evaluating whether a decline in value of any investment is other than temporary  we consider various quantitative and qualitative factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and estimated fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
the fair value of the investment becomes its new cost basis 
the writedowns of fixed maturities in were primarily due to collateral deterioration of several asset backed securities and price declines of a few corporate credits in the airline and energy sectors 
the writedowns in were primarily due to credit deterioration and corporate failures of several issuers  particularly in the telecommunications and  to a lesser extent  energy related industries 
income taxes we establish deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
similarly  we establish deferred tax assets related to the expected future us tax benefit of losses and foreign taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
to evaluate the realization of the future tax benefit of these deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated 
management s judgment is based on its assessment of business plans and related projections of future taxable income as well as available tax planning strategies 
the tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits have no expiration 
however  we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to consider a relatively near term horizon when we evaluate the likelihood of realizing future tax benefits 
during the years through  chubb insurance company of europe chubb europe incurred substantial losses 
these losses were the result of underwriting losses during the period due to inadequate prices and adverse claims trends  particularly for directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability coverages 
at december   the deferred income tax asset related to the expected future us tax benefit of the losses and foreign taxes incurred by chubb europe was million 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a valuation allowance of million for the portion of these tax assets that we could not recognize for accounting purposes due to the requirement to evaluate realization over a near term horizon 
as of december   the deferred income tax asset related to the expected future us tax benefit of the losses and foreign taxes incurred by chubb europe had been reduced to million due to profitable results in chubb europe during as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized over a near term horizon and we eliminated the valuation allowance 
as of december   the deferred tax asset related to the us tax benefit of losses incurred by chubb europe was reduced to zero due to the continued profitability of chubb europe during capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of the corporation and its ability to generate cash flows from its operating subsidiaries  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the corporation had shareholders equity of billion and total debt of billion 
in march  the corporation issued million of unsecured notes due in and million of unsecured notes due in in june  a shelf registration statement that the corporation filed in march was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  up to billion of various types of securities may be issued

net proceeds from the sale of the shares were million 
also  in june  the corporation issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million purchase contracts 
the senior notes and purchase contracts were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represents principal amount of senior notes and one purchase contract 
each purchase contract obligates the investor to purchase for a variable number of shares of the corporation s common stock on august  the number of shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the market price of our common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of our common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the purchase contracts  the corporation will receive proceeds of approximately million and will issue between approximately  and  shares of common stock 
in  the corporation issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million mandatorily exercisable warrants to purchase the corporation s common stock 
the senior notes and warrants were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represents principal amount of senior notes and one warrant 
each warrant obligates the investor to purchase for a variable number of shares of the corporation s common stock on or before november  the number of shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the market price of our common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of our common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the warrants  the corporation will receive proceeds of approximately million and will issue between approximately  and  shares of common stock

the capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption in upon repayment of the debentures 
the capital securities are also subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances beginning in the corporation has guaranteed the unsecured notes and the capital securities 
management continuously monitors the amount of capital resources that the corporation maintains both for itself and its operating subsidiaries 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  the corporation from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy its capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event the corporation were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  the corporation may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
in july  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the corporation s common stock 
in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares 
the authorization has no expiration  the authorization expired on june  as of december    shares remained under the share repurchase authorization 
the corporation made no share repurchases during and the corporation repurchased  shares in open market transactions in at a cost of million 
ratings the corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
the following table summarizes the corporation s credit ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt rating aa a a a preferred stock rating a bbb baa commercial paper amb a p f counterparty credit rating a the following table summarizes our property and casualty subsidiaries financial strength ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch financial strength a aa aa aa ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
it is possible that positive or negative ratings actions by one or more of the rating agencies may occur in the future 
if our ratings were downgraded  the corporation may incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital 
in addition  reductions in our ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our business operations 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
new cash from operations available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately billion in compared with billion in and billion in new cash available in was higher than in due to growth in premium receipts in whereas paid losses were nearly flat compared with the increase in new cash in was due to substantial growth in premium receipts without a commensurate increase in paid losses or operating expenses 
in addition to cash from operations  the property and casualty subsidiaries received capital contributions from the corporation of million in the second quarter of and billion in the fourth quarter of our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain investments in highly liquid  short term and other marketable securities to provide for immediate cash needs 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have been met by dividends from its property and casualty subsidiaries and the issuance of commercial paper and debt and equity securities 
it is expected that our liquidity requirements in the future will be met by these sources of funds or  if necessary  borrowings from our credit facilities 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to the corporation s shareholders will be at the discretion of the corporation s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  the corporation s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its obligations  including the payment of interest and principal on debt obligations  relies on the availability of liquid assets in the corporation  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
various state insurance laws restrict the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  these subsidiaries paid cash dividends to the corporation totaling million 
the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to the corporation during without prior regulatory approval is approximately billion 
we believe that our strong financial position and conservative debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
the corporation has two credit agreements with a group of banks that provide for unsecured borrowings of up to million in the aggregate 
the million short term revolving credit facility  which was to have terminated on june   was extended to june  and may be renewed or replaced 
the million medium term revolving credit facility terminates on june  on the respective termination dates for these agreements  any loans then outstanding become payable 
there have been no borrowings under these agreements 
various interest rate options are available to the corporation  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the facilities are available for general corporate purposes and to support the corporation s commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table provides our future payments due by period under contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type of obligation 
and and thereafter total in millions principal due under long term debt interest  warrant fee and contract adjustment payments on long term debt and equity units future minimum rental payments under operating leases total the above table excludes certain commitments totaling million at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these capital commitments can be called by the partnerships during the commitment period on average  to years to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments 
the above table also excludes estimated future cash flows related to our carried loss reserves at december  there is typically no stated contractual commitment associated with property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
the obligation to pay a claim arises only when a covered loss event occurs and a settlement is reached 
the vast majority of our loss reserves relate to claims for which settlements have not yet been reached 
our loss reserves therefore represent estimates of future payments 
these estimates are dependent on the outcome of future events 
accordingly  the payment of the loss reserves is not fixed as to either amount or timing 
our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses was billion at december  based on our historical experience  we estimate that  of this liability  approximately billion will be paid in  an aggregate billion will be paid in and  and an aggregate billion will be paid in and the ultimate amount and timing of loss payments will likely vary materially from our estimates 
we expect that these loss payments will be funded  in large part  by future cash receipts from operations 
the corporation does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  except as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality bonds  principally tax exempt  us treasury and government agency  mortgage backed securities and corporate issues as well as foreign bonds that support our international operations 
in addition  the portfolio includes equity securities held primarily with the objective of capital appreciation 
in and  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and taxable bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
in  the taxable bonds we invested in were primarily us treasury securities  mortgage backed securities  foreign government bonds and us and foreign corporate bonds 
in  the taxable bonds were primarily mortgage backed securities  foreign government bonds and us treasury securities 
in  we invested new cash in mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  us treasury securities 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december  and  of our fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt bonds compared with at december  fixed maturity securities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december   of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  and at december  changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available  it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the unrealized appreciation before tax of investments carried at market value  which includes fixed maturities classified as available for sale and equity securities  was million   million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates 
change in accounting principles effective january   the corporation adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans  which is the method of accounting defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value method of accounting  compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and recognized over the service period 
prior period financial statements were not restated 
the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans is discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through cfs s financial products portfolio and our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investment portfolio interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates directly affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts

we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
more than of the taxable bonds in our portfolio are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  more than are rated aa or better with about rated aaa 
less than of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our taxable bonds have an average maturity of five years  while our tax exempt bonds mature on average in nine years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life of a security  potentially reducing or increasing its effective yield 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected  aaa rated commercial mortgage backed securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were in investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held non us investments of billion supporting their international operations 
these investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar and the euro 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated amortized market thereafter cost value in millions british pound sterling canadian dollar euro equity price risk is the potential loss in market value of our equity securities resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
our portfolio also includes alternative investments  primarily investment partnerships 
these investments by their nature are less liquid and involve more risk than other investments 
we actively manage our market risk by allocating a comparatively small amount of funds to alternative investments  performing extensive research prior to investing in a new investment and monitoring the performance of the entities in which we have invested 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
financial products the corporation  through cfs s business  assumed exposure to credit risk through portfolio credit default swaps 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  the occurrence of certain defined credit events related to referenced entities within a specified portfolio will result in a deterioration of the subordination 
when losses related to cumulative credit events exceed the subordination  the contract requires cfs to make payment to its counterparty 
these obligations are guaranteed by the corporation 
as discussed in the chubb financial solutions section of md a  we have exited this business and are running off cfs s remaining portfolio credit default swaps 
valuation models are used to estimate the fair value of our obligation in each credit default swap 
within these models  credit spreads are a critical input used to estimate the probability of the occurrence of credit events 
the fair value of a portfolio credit default swap is also a function of the financial ratings of referenced asset backed securities  actual credit events reducing subordination  credit correlation within a portfolio  anticipated recovery rates related to potential defaults and changes in interest rates 
the following table provides information about our portfolio credit default swaps by maturity  including the fair value of future obligations at december  there after total notional exposure in billions remaining subordination in billions fair value of future obligations in millions at december  there after total notional exposure in billions remaining subordination in billions fair value of future obligations in millions cfs also assumed exposure to credit risk through the principal and interest guarantee entered into in that guarantees to the counterparty the payment of any principal or interest amount due and not paid with respect to a group of referenced securities 
the notional exposure at december  under the guarantee was billion 
however  cfs s maximum potential payment obligation is limited to million 
at the inception of the agreement  cfs established a liability of million for the estimated fair value of the guarantee  which remained unchanged at december  debt we also have interest rate risk on our debt obligations 
the following table provides information about our long term debt obligations and related interest rate swap at december  for debt obligations  the table presents expected cash flow of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date
