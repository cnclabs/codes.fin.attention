 management s strategic plan the structure of the utility industry is continually changing  which is driven  in part  by the many different types of government regulation over the industry 
generally  the states in which a utility operates determine the rates that the utility charges its retail customers 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc establishes the rates that utilities charge for power sold at the wholesale level 
the ferc also develops and administers various rules that govern how utilities operate 
utilities also face a wide range of environmental regulations from various government agencies  at both the state and federal level 
the mix of state and federal regulations result in numerous rules and regulations  which are not always consistent and are subject to continual change 
clearly  compliance with all of the regulatory requirements increases the complexity and uncertainty of our business 
in the last decade or so  the ferc and many states developed rules to encourage competition and deregulation of the utility sector 
as a result of these regulatory changes  many utilities have taken steps to prepare for competition and the changing rules 
these actions included completion of mergers and acquisitions to increase economies of scale  efficiency improvements and cost cutting to avoid rate cases and improve competitive position  sales of power plants  use of purchase power contracts to meet growth in electric requirements  and development of nonregulated ventures 
on the federal level  the ferc is still very active in promoting wholesale competition 
wholesale operations account for approximately percent of our revenue 
ferc has authority to withhold market based rates on wholesale sales in certain areas where a utility is determined to have market power control 
however  xcel energy believes that it will continue to have the ability to make sales under its market based tariff 
as part of its agenda to encourage competition  the ferc has also been very active in promoting regional transmission organizations rtos 
in the past  each individual utility controlled its transmission lines 
based on certain ferc initiatives  rtos will control the operations of transmission lines for an entire region to ensure that all parties that want to sell power have access to the lines 
we currently participate in the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc miso and the southwest power pool spp 
we are supportive of rto participation  provided that they offer benefits to our customers and we have clear cost recovery mechanisms 
in  the miso will begin its day operations 
this will result in uncertainty  which may have a positive or negative impact on our wholesale margins 
however  at the state level  many states have stopped utility restructuring activity due to the failure of the california power markets  the collapse of the independent power producers and other factors 
for xcel energy  no significant retail regulatory restructuring has occurred or is expected to occur in any of the states in which we have major utility operations 
in some parts of texas  retail customers can choose their energy provider 
however  due to legislation that extends through  the panhandle of texas  where we have utility operations  remains under traditional regulation 
we believe that the panhandle will remain under traditional regulation after our retail operations represent approximately percent of our revenues 
retail rates are set by state commissions and are intended to provide the utility the opportunity to earn an authorized return on equity 
whether the utility actually earns its authorized return on equity is dependent on many factors including the level of sales growth  changes in a company s cost structure  capital investment  interest rates and other items 
until recently  we have avoided the need to file rate cases by experiencing relatively robust growth in our service territories as well as aggressively managing the costs of our business 
through two mergers  we have realized cost savings and operational efficiencies 
these steps have helped us to avoid filing rate cases  but at the same time  we have made significant investments 
while we will continue to look for ways to reduce costs  the opportunities are no longer large enough to further delay rate cases 
our regulatory strategy is to ensure that we have the opportunity to earn our authorized return on equity in each state 
we are currently not earning our authorized return on equity in the majority of the states where we have our regulated utility operations 
as a result  we have or in the near term will begin filing general rate increases in the majority of our jurisdictions as follows 
in september  we filed for an approximately million natural gas rate increase in minnesota 
the request assumes an percent return on equity 
interim rates  subject to refund  went into effect in december and we expect a decision this summer 
also in  we filed for a million transmission increase at ferc 
in wisconsin  we are required to file a rate case every other year 
therefore  nsp wisconsin will file a case during in minnesota  we plan to file an electric rate case in the fourth quarter of this year with interim rates  subject to refund  effective in early we expect a final commission decision in late summer or early fall of finally  we intend to file an electric rate case in colorado in  with rates expected to be in effect during while recovery of costs cannot be assured  we are optimistic we will receive fair treatment 
we believe that we have fair regulation as demonstrated by the successful agreement reached on projects like the metropolitan emissions reduction project merp in minnesota and the new construction of the comanche electric generating unit in colorado 
our ability to maintain a constructive regulatory framework is a critical component of our strategy and ultimate success 
though we remain open to all opportunities to increase shareholder value  our strategy is to invest in our core electric and natural gas businesses to meet the growing energy needs of our customers  while earning a fair return on our investments 
we refer to our strategy as building the core 
we have no plans or interest in deviating from our core business 
we see four critical factors to create incremental value for our shareholders and view these factors as building blocks 
they are largely independent of each other  but taken together  they have the potential to create significant additional value 
the first is service territory growth 
with the strength and diversity of our service territory  growth provides a solid foundation year after year 
the second driver is incremental investment in our core businesses 
certain incremental investment has already started at a modest level and will grow quickly in the coming years 
key projects include the merp project and the comanche coal plant 
the third driver is to increase the level of equity that we have invested in our operating companies 
additional equity will increase our financial strength  support a higher credit rating and add to earnings and cash flow 
we will work with our regulators to gain support for this initiative 
lastly  we will strive to earn our regulated  authorized returns  which will require filing for rate increases in our largest jurisdictions over the next few years 
execution of our strategy will allow us to meet or exceed our financial objective of delivering an average total return of percent to percent per year 
our total return objective is based on our expectations of long term earnings growth of percent to percent and a dividend yield of approximately percent 
we have established a dividend policy that we believe is sustainable and contributes to a competitive total return for our shareholders 
our objective is to deliver the financial results that will enable our board of directors to grant annual dividend increases at a rate consistent with our long term earnings growth rate 
as we look to  we are focused on several challenges  in addition to the normal day to day operations of our utility business 
we must prepare for operational uncertainty surrounding the implementation of various ferc initiatives  which could impact our short term wholesale margins 
we must manage our procurement efforts to attempt to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs  which are passed on to our customers 
we must continue to look for creative ways to offset rising healthcare and benefit costs  while we continue our efforts to improve reliability and customer service 
while we believe we are well positioned for changing environmental rules and regulations based on the work we have done in the last few years on projects such as merp  we plan to continue our aggressive efforts to improve our environmental performance 
we need to obtain uncontested environmental permits for the new construction of the comanche coal plant 
we expect to complete the sale of seren 
finally  we will need to seek a minnesota electric rate increase at the end of this case will be important as we move into we believe that we have a solid and straightforward strategy and that  as we execute our plan  it will serve to increase shareholder value 
financial review the following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on xcel energy s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented  or are expected to have a material impact in the future 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes 
all note references refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations summary of financial results the following table summarizes the earnings contributions of xcel energy s business segments on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
continuing operations consist of the following regulated utility subsidiaries  operating in the electric and natural gas segments  and several nonregulated subsidiaries and the holding company  where corporate financing activity occurs 
discontinued operations consist of the following seren  a nonregulated subsidiary  which was classified as held for sale in the third quarter of based on a decision to divest this investment  the regulated natural gas businesses viking and bmg  which were sold in  the regulated utility business of cheyenne  which was sold in january  nrg  which emerged from bankruptcy in late  at which time xcel energy divested its ownership interest in nrg  and the nonregulated subsidiaries xcel energy international and e prime  which were classified as held for sale in late based on the decision to divest them 
prior year financial statements have been restated to conform to the current year presentation and classification of certain operations as discontinued

included in all other segment results in note to the consolidated financial statements 
b includes tax benefit related to nrg 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while earnings from continuing operations for were flat compared with  the current period results were favorably impacted by electric sales growth  short term wholesale markets and lower depreciation  offset by the negative impact of unfavorable weather  legal settlement costs and the impacts of certain regulatory accruals  compared with the same period in the loss from discontinued operations in is largely due to an after tax impairment charge of million related to the planned sale of seren 
the after tax impairment charge was increased in the fourth quarter of from the impairment estimate recorded in the third quarter of based on further developed market information  as well as preliminary feedback from prospective buyers 
the earnings in from discontinued operations are primarily due to an adjustment to previously estimated tax benefits related to xcel energy s write off of its investment in nrg 
nrg recorded more than billion of asset impairment and other charges in as it commenced its financial restructuring 
results from discontinued operations are discussed in the discontinued operations section later 
common stock dilution dilution  primarily from common stock and convertible securities issued in  reduced the utility segment earnings from continuing operations by cents per share for  compared with average common stock and equivalent levels in total earnings from continuing operations were reduced by cents per share for  compared with share levels 
in  and  approximately million  million and million average common shares and equivalents  respectively  were used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
statement of operations analysis continuing operations the following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
electric utility  short term wholesale and commodity trading margins electric fuel and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power 
due to fuel cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers in several states  most fluctuations in energy costs do not materially affect electric utility margin 
xcel energy has two distinct forms of wholesale marketing activities short term wholesale and commodity trading 
short term wholesale refers to energy related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from xcel energy s generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load 
commodity trading is not associated with xcel energy s generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load 
xcel energy s commodity trading operations are conducted by nsp minnesota  psco and sps 
margins from commodity trading activity are partially redistributed to other operating utilities of xcel energy  pursuant to a joint operating agreement joa approved by the ferc 
on a consolidated basis  the impact of the joa is eliminated 
short term wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the impact of regulatory sharing  if applicable 
trading revenues  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  are reported net of trading costs ie  on a margin basis in the consolidated statements of operations 
commodity trading costs include fuel  purchased power  transmission and other related costs 
the following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility  short term wholesale and commodity trading activities millions of dollars base electric utility short term wholesale commodity trading consolidated totals electric utility revenue excluding commodity trading fuel and purchased power commodity trading revenue commodity trading costs gross margin before operating expenses margin as a percentage of revenue electric utility revenue excluding commodity trading fuel and purchased power commodity trading revenue commodity trading costs gross margin before operating expenses margin as a percentage of revenue electric utility revenue excluding commodity trading fuel and purchased power commodity trading revenue commodity trading costs gross margin before operating expenses margin as a percentage of revenue the following summarizes the components of the changes in base electric utility revenue and base electric utility margin for the years ended dec

partially offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of significantly cooler summer temperatures in compared with the summer of  as well as estimated customer refunds related to quality of service obligations in colorado 
comparison with base electric utility revenues increased due to weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately percent  higher fuel and purchased power costs  which are largely passed through to customers  and higher capacity sales in texas 
in addition  the aqir was implemented in colorado in january for the recovery of investments and related costs to improve air quality 
partially offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of warmer temperatures during the summer of compared with the summer of  as well as rate reductions related to lower property taxes in minnesota and estimated customer refunds related to service quality requirements in colorado

estimated impact of weather sales growth excluding weather impact purchased capacity costs other cost recovery quality of service obligations renewable development fund recovery capacity sales regulatory accruals and other total base electric utility margin decrease comparison to base electric utility margin decreased due to the impact of weather  higher purchased capacity costs associated with new contracts to support growth  higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass through recovery mechanisms  mainly in wisconsin  and regulatory accruals associated with potential customer refunds related to service quality obligations in colorado and fuel reconciliation proceedings in texas 
these decreases were partially offset by weather normalized sales growth 
comparison to base electric utility margin decreased due mainly to higher purchased capacity costs associated with new contracts to support growth  the allowed recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in excess of actual costs in under the sharing provisions of the incentive cost adjustment mechanism in colorado  compared with passing through costs with no sharing provisions under the interim adjustment clause in  and the impact of weather 
also decreasing margin were rate reductions related to lower property taxes in minnesota and estimated refunds to customers related to service quality requirements in colorado 
the decreases were partially offset by weather normalized sales growth  the implementation of the aqir and higher capacity sales  as previously discussed 
short term wholesale and commodity trading margin comparison to short term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased approximately million in compared with the increase reflects a number of market factors  including higher market prices  additional resources available for sale and a pre existing contract  which provided approximately million of short term wholesale margins in and expired in the first quarter of comparison to short term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased approximately million in compared with the increase reflects more favorable market conditions in the northern regions 
natural gas utility margins the following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin 
the cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale natural gas purchases 
however  due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers  fluctuations in the wholesale cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin 
millions of dollars natural gas utility revenue cost of natural gas purchased and transported natural gas utility margin the following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas revenue and margin for the years ended dec

comparison to natural gas margin decreased due to the rate decrease discussed above and the impact of warmer winter temperatures in compared with the rate case settlement agreement is discussed further under factors affecting results of continuing operations 
weather xcel energy s earnings can be significantly affected by weather 
unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales  but also can increase expenses 
unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales  but may not reduce expenses  which affects overall results 
the impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers  temperature variances and the amount of gas or electricity the average customer historically has used per degree of temperature 
the following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of xcel energy due to temperature variations from historical averages weather in decreased earnings by an estimated cents per share  weather in had minimal impact on earnings per share  and weather in increased earnings by an estimated cents per share 
nonregulated operating margins the following table details the changes in nonregulated revenue and margin included in continuing operations millions of dollars nonregulated and other revenue nonregulated cost of goods sold nonregulated margin comparison to nonregulated revenue decreased in  due primarily to the discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned 
comparison to nonregulated revenue increased in  due mainly to increased revenues at utility engineering 
nonregulated margin decreased in  due to higher cost of goods sold at a subsidiary of utility engineering 
non fuel operating expense and other items other utility operating and maintenance expense other operating and maintenance expenses for increased by approximately million  or percent  compared with of the increase  million of increased costs are offset by increased revenue  including those incurred to assist with the storm damage repair in florida 
the remaining increase of million is primarily due to lower pension credits and higher employee benefit costs of million  higher electric service reliability costs of million  higher information technology costs of million  higher legal settlement costs of million  higher plant related costs of million  higher costs related to a customer billing system conversion of million and million of increased costs primarily related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the higher costs were partially offset by lower compensation costs of million  lower costs associated with inventory adjustments of million and lower private fuel storage costs of million 
other operating and maintenance expenses increased million  or percent  in compared with the increase is due primarily to higher employee related costs  including higher performance based compensation of million  restricted stock unit grants of million  lower pension credits of million and higher medical and health care costs of million 
in  there were no restricted stock unit grants and only a partial award of performance base compensation 
in addition  other utility operating and maintenance expense for reflects inventory write downs of million  higher uncollectible accounts receivable of million  higher reliability expenses of million and a software project write off of million 
the increase was partially offset by lower information technology costs resulting from centralization 
other nonregulated operating and maintenance expense other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared with this decrease resulted from the dissolution of planergy and the discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned after the divestiture of nrg 
see additional discussion of the total results for each nonregulated subsidiary later 
other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared with the expenses included employee severance costs at the holding company 
these expenses are included in the results for each nonregulated subsidiary  as discussed later 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for decreased by approximately million  or percent  compared with  and million  or percent  in compared with the fluctuations are largely due to several regulatory decisions in in  as a result of a minnesota public utilities commission mpuc order  nsp minnesota modified its decommissioning expense recognition  which served to reduce decommissioning accruals by approximately million compared with in addition  effective july   the colorado public utilities commission cpuc lengthened the depreciable lives of certain electric utility plant at psco as a part of the general colorado rate case  reducing annual depreciation expense by million 
psco experienced the full impact of the annual reduction in  resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of million for compared with during  the minnesota legislature authorized additional spent nuclear fuel storage at the prairie island nuclear plant 
in december  the mpuc extended the authorized depreciable lives of the two generating units at the prairie island nuclear plant  retroactive to jan 
  reducing depreciation by million 
special charges special charges in were million relating to the settlement of shareholder litigation 
special charges reported in relate to the translink transmission co  llc translink project and nrg restructuring costs 
special charges for include nrg restructuring costs  as discussed later  but are largely related to regulated utility costs 
regulated utility earnings from continuing operations were reduced by approximately cents per share in due to a million regulatory recovery adjustment for sps and million in employee separation costs associated with a restaffing initiative for utility and service company operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these items 
interest and other income  net of nonoperating expenses interest and other income  net of nonoperating expenses increased million in compared with the increase is due to interest income related to the finalization of prior period internal revenue service irs audits of million 
partially offsetting the increase was the impact of a utility engineering gain on the sale of water rights in  net of write offs of certain intangible assets 
interest and other income  net of nonoperating expenses decreased million in compared with interest income decreased million primarily due to interest received on tax refunds in other income decreased million primarily due to a gain on the sale of contracts at planergy in interest and financing costs interest charges and financing costs decreased approximately million  or percent  for  compared with the decrease for the year reflects savings from refinancing higher coupon debt during and lower credit line fees  partially offset by interest expense related to prior period irs audits 
interest and financing costs increased approximately million  or percent  for compared with this increase was due to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in the latter part of intended to reduce dependence on short term debt 
in addition  during  xcel energy incurred approximately million to redeem temporary holding company debt 
during  xcel energy issued approximately billion of long term debt to refinance higher coupon debt 
during  certain long term debt was refinanced at higher interest rates 
income tax expense the effective tax rate was percent for the year  compared with percent for the same period in significant tax benefits were recorded during the fourth quarters of and due to the resolution of tax audit issues  largely related to prior periods 
significant income tax audit activity occurring in continued in with the exception of the corporate owned life insurance coli loan interest deductibility  as discussed in note  during  xcel energy concluded irs income tax audit and appeal activities spanning several examination cycles dating back to in addition  the irs nearly completed the examination cycle ended and began its review of xcel energy s and tax years 
in  income tax benefits of million were recorded  including million related to the successful resolution of various irs audit issues and other adjustments to current and deferred taxes related to prior years  million for the return to actual true up and million from revisions to benefits related to asset and foreign power sales 
excluding the tax benefits  the effective rate for would have been percent 
in  income tax benefits of million were recorded to reflect the resolution of tax audit issues related to prior years 
the tax issues resolved during included the tax deductibility of certain merger costs associated with the mergers to form xcel energy and new century energies  inc nce and the deductibility  for state purposes  of certain tax benefit transfer lease benefits 
excluding these tax benefits  the effective rate for would have been percent

other nonregulated subsidiaries and holding company results the following tables summarize the net income and earnings per share contributions of the continuing operations of xcel energy s nonregulated businesses and holding company results millions of dollars contribution to xcel energy s earnings eloigne company planergy financing costs holding company special charges holding company other nonregulated and holding company results total nonregulated holding company loss continuing operations contribution to xcel energy s earnings per share eloigne company planergy financing costs and preferred dividends holding company special charges holding company other nonregulated and holding company results total nonregulated holding company loss per share continuing operations eloigne company eloigne invests in affordable housing that qualifies for federal and state tax credits 
eloigne s earnings contribution is expected to decline slightly each year as tax credits on mature affordable housing projects begin to decline 
planergy planergy provided energy management services 
planergy s losses were lower in due to the dissolution of its business 
its losses were lower in largely due to pretax gains of approximately million from the sale of a portfolio of energy management contracts  which reduced losses by approximately cents per share 
financing costs and preferred dividends nonregulated results include interest expense and the earnings per share impact of preferred dividends  which are incurred at the xcel energy and intermediate holding company levels  and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries 
in november  the xcel energy holding company issued temporary financing  which included detachable options for the purchase of xcel energy notes  which were convertible to xcel energy common stock 
this temporary financing was replaced with long term holding company financing in late november costs incurred to redeem the temporary financing included a redemption premium of million  million of debt discount associated with the detachable option  and other issuance costs  which increased financing costs and reduced earnings by cents per share 
the earnings per share impact of financing costs and preferred dividends for and included above reflects dilutive securities  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of the dilutive securities  if converted  is a reduction of interest expense resulting in an increase in net income of approximately million  or cents per share  in  and million  or cents per share  in holding company special charges during  special charges at the holding company consisted of an accrual of million for a settlement agreement related to shareholder lawsuits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these special charges 
during  nrg experienced credit rating downgrades  defaults under certain credit agreements  increased collateral requirements and reduced liquidity 
these events ultimately led to the restructuring of nrg in late and its bankruptcy filing in may see note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain costs related to nrg s restructuring were incurred at the holding company level and included in continuing operations and reported as special charges 
approximately million of these costs were incurred in and million were incurred in  which reduced after tax earnings by approximately cents per share and cent per share  respectively 
costs in included approximately million of financial advisor fees  legal costs and consulting costs related to the nrg bankruptcy transaction 
these charges were partially offset by a million pension curtailment gain related to the termination of nrg employees from xcel energy s pension plan 
in  xcel energy also recorded a million charge in connection with the suspension of the formation of the independent transmission company translink 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these special charges 
other nonregulated in  utility engineering sold water rights  resulting in a pretax gain reported as nonoperating income of million 
the gain increased after tax income by approximately cents per share 
statement of operations analysis discontinued operations a summary of the various components of discontinued operations is as follows for the years ended dec

regulated utility segments income per share nrg segment loss per share xcel energy international e prime seren innovations other nrg related tax benefits expense nonregulated other income loss per share total income loss per share from discontinued operations regulated utility results discontinued operations during  xcel energy completed the sale of two subsidiaries in its regulated natural gas utility segment viking  including its interest in guardian pipeline  llc  and bmg 
after tax disposal gains of million  or cents per share  were recorded for the natural gas utility segment  primarily related to the sale of viking 
viking had minimal income in  as it was sold in january of that year 
income from viking was higher in  compared with  primarily due to increased revenues 
during january  xcel energy reached an agreement to sell its regulated electric and natural gas subsidiary cheyenne 
as a result of this agreement  xcel energy is reporting cheyenne results as a component of discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale was completed in january and resulted in an after tax loss of approximately million  or cents per share  which was accrued at dec 
nrg results discontinued operations due to nrg s emergence from bankruptcy in december and xcel energy s corresponding divestiture of its ownership interest in nrg  xcel energy s share of nrg results for current and prior periods is now shown as a component of discontinued operations 
nrg results compared with as a result of nrg s emergence from bankruptcy in december  xcel energy did not retain an ownership interest in nrg after that date 
therefore  xcel energy financial statements do not contain any results of nrg operations in see note to the consolidated financial statements and the following discussion for further information 
nrg results compared with as a result of nrg s bankruptcy filing in may  xcel energy ceased the consolidation of nrg and began accounting for its investment in nrg using the equity method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
after changing to the equity method  xcel energy was limited in the amount of nrg s losses subsequent to the bankruptcy date that it was required to record 
in accordance with these limitations under the equity method  xcel energy stopped recognizing equity in the losses of nrg subsequent to the quarter ended june  these limitations provided for loss recognition by xcel energy until its investment in nrg was written off to zero  with further loss recognition to continue if its financial commitments to nrg existed beyond amounts already invested 
xcel energy initially recorded more losses than the limitations allow as of june   but upon xcel energy s divestiture of its interest in nrg  the nrg losses recorded in excess of xcel energy s investment in and financial commitment to nrg were reversed in the fourth quarter of this resulted in a noncash gain of million  or cents per share  for the quarter and an adjustment of the total nrg losses recorded for the year to million  or cents per share 
nrg s results included in xcel energy s earnings for were as follows millions of dollars six months ended june  total nrg loss losses not recorded by xcel energy under the equity method equity in losses of nrg included in xcel energy results for these represent nrg losses incurred in the first and second quarters of that were in excess of the amounts recordable by xcel energy under the equity method of accounting limitations discussed previously 
following its credit downgrade in july  nrg experienced credit and liquidity constraints and commenced a financial and business restructuring  including a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection 
this restructuring created significant incremental costs and resulted in numerous asset impairments as the strategic and economic value of assets under development and in operation changed 
nrg s asset impairments and related charges in were approximately million related to its neo landfill gas projects and equity investments  planned disposals of domestic and international projects  and regulatory developments and changing circumstances that adversely affected nrg s ability to recover the carrying value of certain investments 
as of the bankruptcy filing date may   xcel energy had recognized million of nrg s impairments and related charges as these charges were recorded by nrg prior to may  consequently  xcel energy recorded its equity in nrg results in excess of its financial commitment to nrg under the settlement agreement reached in march among xcel energy  nrg and nrg s creditors 
these excess losses were reversed upon nrg s emergence from bankruptcy in december  as discussed previously 
in  nrg s operating results excluding the unusual items discussed above were affected by higher market prices due to higher natural gas prices and an increase in capacity revenues due to additional projects becoming operational in the later part of in addition  the sale of an nrg investment in resulted in a favorable impact in as the investment generated substantial equity losses in the prior years 
the increase was offset by losses incurred on contracts in connecticut due to increased market prices  increased operating expenses  contract terminations and liquidated damages triggered by nrg s financial condition and additional restructuring charges 
during  the tax filing status of nrg for and future years changed from being included as part of xcel energy s consolidated federal income tax group to filing on a stand alone basis 
other nonregulated results discontinued operations on sept 
  xcel energy s board of directors approved management s plan to pursue the sale of seren  a wholly owned broadband communications services subsidiary 
seren delivers cable television  high speed internet and telephone service over an advanced network to approximately  customers in st 
cloud  minn  and concord and walnut creek  calif 
as a result of the decision  seren is accounted for as discontinued operations 
the sale of such investment is expected to be completed by mid during  xcel energy s board of directors approved management s plan to exit businesses conducted by e prime and xcel energy international 
e prime ceased conducting business in also during  xcel energy completed the sales of the argentina subsidiaries of xcel energy international 
nonregulated results compared with results of discontinued nonregulated operations in include the impact of the sales of the argentina subsidiaries of xcel energy international 
the sales were completed in three transactions with a total sales price of approximately million  including certain adjustments that reached finalization in the fourth quarter of approximately million was placed in escrow  which is expected to remain in place until at least the end of the first quarter of  to support customary indemnity obligations under the sales agreement 
in addition to the sales price  xcel energy also received approximately million at the closing of one transaction as redemption of its capital investment 
the sales resulted in a gain of approximately million  including the realization of approximately million of income tax benefits realizable upon sale of the xcel energy international assets 
in addition  results from discontinued operations include the impact of an after tax impairment charge for seren  including disposition costs  of million  or cents per share 
the impairment charge was recorded based on operating results  market conditions and preliminary feedback from prospective buyers 
nonregulated results compared with results of discontinued nonregulated operations  other than nrg  include an after tax loss of million  or cents per share  for the disposal of xcel energy international s assets  based on the estimated fair value of such assets 
these losses from discontinued nonregulated operations also include a charge of million for costs of settling a commodity futures trading commission trading investigation of e prime 
tax benefits related to investment in nrg xcel energy has recognized tax benefits related to the divestiture of nrg 
these tax benefits  since related to xcel energy s investment in discontinued nrg operations  also are reported as discontinued operations 
during  xcel energy recognized an initial estimate of the expected tax benefits of million 
based on the results of a preliminary tax basis study of nrg  xcel energy recorded million of additional tax benefits in in  the nrg basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by million 
based on current forecasts of taxable income and tax liabilities  xcel energy expects to realize approximately billion of cash savings from these tax benefits through a refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years 
xcel energy used million and million of these tax benefits in and  respectively  and expects to use million in the remainder of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used over subsequent years 
factors affecting results of continuing operations xcel energy s utility revenues depend on customer usage  which varies with weather conditions  general business conditions and the cost of energy services 
various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect our ability to recover our costs from customers 
in addition  xcel energy s nonregulated businesses have had an adverse impact on xcel energy s earnings in  and the historical and future trends of xcel energy s operating results have been  and are expected to be  affected by a number of factors  including the following general economic conditions economic conditions may have a material impact on xcel energy s operating results 
the united states economy continues to show evidence of recovery as measured by growth in the gross domestic product 
however  certain operating costs  such as those for insurance and security  have increased during the past three years due to economic uncertainty  terrorist activity and war or the threat of war 
management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown  fluctuating energy prices  terrorist activity  war or the threat of war 
however  xcel energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations  future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a slowdown in future economic growth 
sales growth in addition to the impact of weather  customer sales levels in xcel energy s regulated utility businesses can vary with economic conditions  energy prices  customer usage patterns and other factors 
weather normalized sales growth for retail electric utility customers was estimated to be percent in compared with  and percent in compared with weather normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers was estimated to be approximately percent in compared with and percent in compared with projections indicate that weather normalized sales growth in compared with will be approximately percent for retail electric utility customers and percent for firm gas utility customers 
pension plan costs and assumptions xcel energy s pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions  most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting 
in addition  the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the accompanying financial statements 
pension costs have been increasing in recent years  and are expected to increase further over the next several years  due to lower than expected investment returns experienced in prior years and decreases in interest rates used to discount benefit obligations 
while investment returns exceeded the assumed level of percent in and percent in  investment returns in and were below the assumed level of percent and discount rates have declined from the percent to percent levels used in through cost determinations to percent used in xcel energy continually reviews its pension assumptions and  in  expects to change the investment return assumption to percent and the discount rate assumption to percent 
the investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns assumed on smoothed or market related asset levels and actual returns earned is deferred in the year the difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five year period 
this gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five year  moving average value of pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the cost determination process  and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the subsequent five year period 
based on the use of average market related asset values  and considering the expected recognition of past investment gains and losses over the next five years  achieving the assumed rate of asset return of percent in each future year and holding other assumptions constant  xcel energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes in continuing operations will increase from a credit  or negative expense  of million in to an expense of million in and million in pension costs are currently a credit due to the recognized investment asset returns exceeding the other pension cost components  such as benefits earned for current service and interest costs for the effects of the passage of time on discounted obligations 
xcel energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates quoted by an established credit rating agency  moody s investors service moody s  and has consistently benchmarked the interest rate used to derive the discount rate to the movements in the long term corporate bond indices for bonds rated aaa through baa by moody s  which have a period to maturity comparable to our projected benefit obligations 
at dec 
  the annualized moody s baa index rate was percent and the aaa index rate was percent 
the corresponding pension discount rate was percent 
at dec 
  the annualized moody s baa index rate had declined basis points to percent  and the aaa index rate had declined basis points to percent 
accordingly  the discount rate as of dec 
  was lowered basis points to percent 
this rate was used to value the actuarial benefit obligations at that date  and will be used in pension cost determinations 
if xcel energy were to use alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations  a percent change would result in the following impacts on the estimated pension costs recognized by xcel energy for financial reporting purposes a basis point higher rate of return  percent  would decrease pension costs by million  a basis point lower rate of return  percent  would increase pension costs by million  a basis point higher discount rate  percent  would decrease pension costs by million  and a basis point lower discount rate  percent  would increase pension costs by million 
alternative employee retirement income security act of erisa funding assumptions would also change the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plans 
cash funding requirements can be affected by changes to actuarial assumptions  actual asset levels and other calculations prescribed by the funding requirements of income tax and other pension related regulations 
these regulations did not require cash funding in recent years for xcel energy s pension plans  and do not require funding in assuming that future asset return levels equal the actuarial assumption of percent for the years and  xcel energy projects  under current funding regulations  that no cash funding would be required for and cash funding of million would be required for actual performance can affect these funding requirements significantly 
current funding regulations are under legislative review in and  if not retained in their current form  could change these funding requirements materially 
regulation xcel energy  its utility subsidiaries and certain of its nonutility subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by the sec under the puhca with respect to issuances and sales of securities  acquisitions and sales of certain utility properties and intra system sales of certain non power goods and services 
in addition  the puhca generally limits the ability of registered holding companies to acquire additional public utility systems and to acquire and retain businesses unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company 
see further discussion of financing restrictions under liquidity and capital resources 
xcel energy s utility subsidiaries also are regulated by the ferc and state regulatory commissions 
decisions by these regulators can significantly impact xcel energy s results of operations 
xcel energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions 
the electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of xcel energy s utility subsidiaries are approved by the ferc and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate 
the rates are generally designed to recover plant investment  operating costs and an allowed return on investment 
xcel energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions 
because comprehensive rate changes are requested infrequently in some states  changes in operating costs can affect xcel energy s financial results 
in addition to changes in operating costs  other factors affecting rate filings are new investment  sales growth  conservation and demand side management efforts  and the cost of capital 
in addition  the return on equity authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings 
the most recently authorized electric utility returns are percent for nsp minnesota  percent for nsp wisconsin  percent for psco and percent for sps 
most of the retail rates for xcel energy s utility subsidiaries provide for periodic adjustments to billings and revenues to allow for recovery of changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation  purchased energy  purchased natural gas for resale and  in minnesota and colorado  conservation  energy management program costs and certain other costs 
in colorado  certain purchased electric capacity costs are recovered through a rate adjustment mechanism 
in minnesota  generally changes in purchased electric capacity costs are not recovered through these rate adjustment mechanisms 
for wisconsin electric operations  where automatic cost of energy adjustment clauses are not allowed  the biennial retail rate review process and an interim fuel cost hearing process provide the opportunity for rate recovery of changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu of a cost of energy adjustment clause 
in colorado  psco had an interim adjustment clause that allowed for recovery of all prudently incurred electric fuel and purchased energy expenses in in  psco generally recovered all prudently incurred electric fuel and purchased energy costs through an electric commodity adjustment clause 
additionally  this fuel mechanism also has in place a sharing among customers and shareholders of certain fuel and energy costs  with an million maximum on any cost sharing over or under an allowed electric commodity adjustment formula rate  and a sharing among shareholders and customers of certain gains and losses on trading margins 
in  psco estimated that energy costs incurred were lower than the commodity adjustment formula rate and accrued an incentive of million at dec 
xcel energy s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants  and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy distribution system 
in addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments  in and approval was obtained from colorado and minnesota regulators to recover  through a rate surcharge  certain costs to upgrade plants and lower emissions in the denver and minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan areas 
these rate recovery mechanisms are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis 
regulated public utilities are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods and to record as regulatory liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods 
in contrast  nonregulated enterprises would expense these costs and recognize the income in the current period 
if restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  xcel energy may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment  and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet 
such changes could have a material effect on xcel energy s results of operations in the period the write off is recorded 
at dec 
  xcel energy reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately million and regulatory liabilities of approximately billion that would be recognized in the statement of operations in the absence of regulation 
in addition to a potential write off of regulatory assets and liabilities  restructuring and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals 
tax matters interest expense deductibility psco s wholly owned subsidiary  psr investments  inc psri  owns and manages permanent life insurance policies  known as coli policies  on some of psco s employees 
at various times  borrowings have been made against the cash values of these coli policies and deductions taken on the interest expense on these borrowings 
the irs has challenged the deductibility of such interest expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years through should the irs ultimately prevail on this issue  tax and interest payable through dec 
  would reduce earnings by an estimated million 
in  xcel energy received formal notification that the irs will seek penalties 
if penalties plus associated interest are also included  the total exposure through dec 
  is approximately million 
xcel energy estimates its annual earnings for would be reduced by million  after tax  which represents cents per share  if coli interest expense deductions were no longer available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
accounting for uncertain tax positions in late july  the financial accounting standards board fasb discussed potential changes or clarifications in the criteria for recognition of tax benefits  which may result in raising the threshold for recognizing tax benefits  which have some degree of uncertainty 
the fasb has not issued any proposed guidance  but an exposure draft may be released in the first quarter of xcel energy is unable to determine the impact or timing of any potential accounting changes required by the fasb  but such changes could have a material financial impact 
environmental matters environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning  storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel  disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment 
a trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has caused  and may continue to cause  higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance 
in addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses  costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes were approximately million in  million in  and million in xcel energy expects to expense an average of approximately million per year from through for similar costs 
however  the precise timing and amount of environmental costs  including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials  are currently unknown 
additionally  the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not certain 
capital expenditures on environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately million in  million in  and million in the regulated utilities expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in and approximately million of related expenditures during the period from through approximately million and million of these expenditures  respectively  are related to modifications to reduce the emissions of nsp minnesota s generating plants located in the minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan area pursuant to the metropolitan emissions reduction project  which are recoverable from customers through cost recovery mechanisms 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of xcel energy s environmental contingencies 
impact of nonregulated investments in the past  xcel energy s investments in nonregulated operations have had a significant impact on its results of operations 
as a result of the divestiture of nrg and other nonregulated operations  xcel energy does not expect that its investments in nonregulated operations will continue to have such a significant impact on its results 
xcel energy does not expect to make any material investments in nonregulated projects 
xcel energy s remaining nonregulated businesses may carry a higher level of risk than its traditional utility businesses 
inflation inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect xcel energy s prices or returns to shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
the application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events  including the likelihood of success of particular projects  legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs 
these judgments  in and of themselves  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions  which may be appropriate to use 
in addition  the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect  not only on the operation of the business  but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed 
the following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of xcel energy s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions 
each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the audit committee of the xcel energy board of directors

for example probable outcomes of regulatory proceedings are assessed in cases of requested cost recovery or other approvals from regulators 
the ability to operate plant facilities and recover the related costs over their useful operating lives  or such other period designated by our regulators  is assumed 
probable outcomes of reviews and challenges raised by tax authorities  including appeals and litigation where necessary  are assessed 
projections are made regarding earnings on pension investments  and the salary increases provided to employees over their periods of service 
future cash inflows of operations are projected in order to assess whether they will be sufficient to recover future cash outflows  including the impacts of product price changes and market penetration to customer groups 
the information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of xcel energy  or otherwise change over time 
this may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available 
the accompanying financial statements reflect management s best estimates and judgments of the impacts of these factors as of dec 
 recently implemented accounting changes for a discussion of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting changes statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r related to equity based compensation 
this statement replaces the original sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  companies are no longer allowed to account for their share based payment awards using the intrinsic value allowed by previous accounting requirements  which did not require any expense to be recorded on stock options granted with an equal to or greater than fair market value exercise price 
instead  equity based compensation arrangements will be measured and recognized based on the grant date fair value using an option pricing model such as black scholes or binomial that considers at least six factors identified in sfas no 
r 
an expense related to the difference between the grant date fair value and the purchase price would be recognized over the vesting period of the options 
under previous guidance  companies were allowed to initially estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they actually occurred 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant and to adjust that estimate when information becomes available that suggests actual forfeitures will differ from previous estimates 
revisions to forfeiture estimates will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the revision occurs 
previous accounting guidance allowed for compensation expense related to performance share plans to be reversed if the target was not met 
however  under sfas no 
r  compensation expense for performance share plans that expire unexercised due to the company s failure to reach a certain target stock price cannot be reversed 
any accruals made for xcel energy s restricted stock unit plan could not be reversed if the target was not met 
implementation of sfas no 
r is required for interim or annual periods beginning after june  xcel energy is required to adopt the provisions in the third quarter of implementation is not expected to have a material impact on net income or earnings per share 
derivatives  risk management and market risk in the normal course of business  xcel energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks 
market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
all financial and commodity related instruments  including derivatives  are subject to market risk 
these risks  as applicable to xcel energy and its subsidiaries  are discussed in further detail below 
commodity price risk xcel energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their generation and retail distribution operations 
commodity price risk is managed by entering into both long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric power  natural gas  coal and fuel oil 
commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments 
xcel energy s risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists 
short term wholesale and commodity trading risk xcel energy s subsidiaries conduct various commodity marketing activities  including the purchase and sale of capacity  energy and energy related instruments 
these marketing activities are primarily focused on specific regions where market knowledge and experience have been obtained and are generally less than one year in length 
xcel energy s risk management policy allows management to conduct the marketing activities within approved guidelines and limitations as approved by the company s risk management committee  which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by the policy 
certain contracts within the scope of these activities qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  while others are subject to the fair value requirements of this pronouncement 
the fair value of the commodity trading contracts for continuing operations as of dec 
  was as follows millions of dollars fair value of trading contracts outstanding at jan 
 contracts realized or settled during the year fair value of trading contract additions and changes during the year fair value of contracts outstanding at dec 
 as of dec 
  the sources of fair value of the commodity trading and hedging net assets were as follows commodity trading contracts futures forwards thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total futures forwards fair value nsp minnesota psco total futures forwards fair value options thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total options fair value psco total options fair value hedge contracts futures forwards thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total futures forwards fair value psco total futures forwards fair value options thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total options fair value nsp minnesota nsp wisconsin psco total options fair value prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices 
prices based on models and other valuation methods 
these represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available 
internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms 
the models reflect management s estimates  taking into account observable market prices  estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors  estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes 
market price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the model 
normal purchases and sales transactions  as defined by sfas no 
 as amended  have been excluded 
at dec 
  a percent increase in market prices over the next months for trading contracts would impact pretax income from continuing operations by approximately million  whereas a percent decrease would impact pretax income from continuing operations by approximately million 
hedge contracts are accounted for as a component of other comprehensive income and would not directly impact earnings 
xcel energy s short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions  contracts and obligations that have been entered into  but not closed  using an industry standard methodology known as value at risk var 
var expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions  contracts and obligations over a particular period of time  with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions 
xcel energy utilizes the variance covariance approach in calculating var 
the var model employs a percent confidence interval level based on historical price movement  lognormal price distribution assumption  delta half gamma approach for non linear instruments and a three day holding period for both electricity and natural gas 
previously  xcel energy calculated var using a holding period of five days for electricity and two days for natural gas 
however  the methodology was changed to ensure consistency in risk measurement across both commodities 
xcel energy s revised holding periods remain consistent with current industry practice 
var using the current methodology for and previous methodology for are as follows as of dec 
  the calculated vars using the current methodology were current methodology year ended during millions of dollars dec 
 average high low commodity trading a a comprises transactions for nsp minnesota  psco and sps 
as of dec 
  the calculated vars using the previous methodology were previous methodology year ended during millions of dollars dec 
 average high low electric commodity trading a natural gas commodity trading b natural gas retail marketing b other a comprises transactions for both nsp minnesota and psco 
b conducted by e prime  which is a discontinued operation 
interest rate risk xcel energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
xcel energy s risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps  caps  collars and put or call options 
xcel energy engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure 
the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in other comprehensive income 
reclassification of unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from other comprehensive income into earnings occurs as interest payments are accrued on the debt instrument and generally offsets the change in the interest accrued on the underlying variable rate debt 
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset  liability or firm commitment 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair values of related hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments 
to test the effectiveness of such swaps  a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the critical terms of the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to assess the effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing basis  if required 
the assessment is done periodically to ensure the swaps continue to be effective 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through counterparty valuations  internal valuations and broker quotes 
there have been no material changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest rate swaps during the periods presented 
at dec 
 and  a basis point change in the benchmark rate on xcel energy s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of xcel energy and its subsidiaries interest rate swaps 
xcel energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds  as required by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  to fund certain costs of nuclear decommissioning  which are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk 
as of dec 
 and  these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities and fixed rate fixed income securities 
per nrc mandates  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates  therefore fluctuations in equity prices  or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings 
credit risk in addition to the risks discussed previously  xcel energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
xcel energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations 
xcel energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties 
xcel energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate  such as letters of credit  parental guarantees  standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures 
the credit exposure is monitored and  when necessary  the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided 
at dec 
  a percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark to market increase in credit risk exposure of million  while a decrease of percent would have resulted in a decrease of million 
foreign currency exchange risk due to the discontinuance of nrg and xcel energy international s operations in  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  xcel energy no longer has material foreign currency exchange risk 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows millions of dollars cash provided by used in operating activities continuing operations discontinued operations total cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations increased million during compared with due to the timing of payments made for trade payables partially offset by increased inventory costs related to higher natural gas costs  which will be collected from customers in future periods 
cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations decreased million during compared with during  xcel energy paid million pursuant to the nrg settlement agreement  which was partially offset by tax benefits received 
cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations decreased during compared with primarily due to decreases in recovery of deferred fuel costs 
cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations decreased during compared with due to the de consolidation of nrg for reporting and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year 
the decrease was partially offset by tax benefits received in connection with the divestiture of nrg in millions of dollars cash provided by used in investing activities continuing operations discontinued operations total cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased million during compared with primarily due to increased utility capital expenditures 
cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations decreased million during compared with primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of viking in cash used in investing activities for continuing operations was approximately the same during compared with due to comparable utility construction expenditures 
cash flows for investing activities related to discontinued operations increased during compared with due to the de consolidation of nrg for reporting and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year 
nrg had significant construction expenditures during prior to its financial difficulties 
millions of dollars cash provided by used in financing activities continuing operations discontinued operations total cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations increased million during compared with primarily due to increased short term borrowings partially offset by a common stock repurchase 
cash flows for financing activities related to continuing operations decreased during compared with due to refinancing activities in to better align xcel energy s capital structure and manage the cost of capital given the improving credit quality of xcel energy and its subsidiaries 
during  xcel energy and its subsidiaries extinguished billion of long term debt and issued approximately billion of long term debt  as shown in the consolidated statement of capitalization 
cash flows for financing activities related to discontinued operations decreased during compared with due to the de consolidation of nrg for reporting and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year

consequently  xcel energy s capital expenditure forecast includes billion  approximately two thirds of the total cost 
xcel energy is evaluating a potential investment in a wind generation project of approximately million  currently not included in the capital expenditure forecast 
a decision to move forward with this type of investment will be dependent on the extension of federal tax credits related to wind generation  favorable regulatory recovery and other business considerations 
the capital expenditure programs of xcel energy are subject to continuing review and modification 
actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth  the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power  as well as alternative plans for meeting xcel energy s long term energy needs

common stock dividends future dividend levels will be dependent upon the statutory limitations discussed below  as well as xcel energy s results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other factors  and will be evaluated by the xcel energy board of directors 
xcel energy s objective is to deliver the financial results that will enable the board of directors to grant annual dividend increases at a rate consistent with our long term earnings growth rate 
xcel energy s dividend policy balances projected cash generation from utility operations  projected capital investment in the utility businesses  reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment  and impact on xcel energy s capital structure and credit ratings 
under puhca  unless there is an order from the sec  a holding company or any subsidiary may only declare and pay dividends out of retained earnings 
xcel energy had million of retained earnings at dec 
  and expects to declare dividends as scheduled 
the cash to pay dividends to xcel energy shareholders is primarily derived from dividends received from the utility subsidiaries 
the utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to be paid to the holding company 
the limitation is imposed through equity ratio limitations that range from percent to percent 
all utility subsidiaries are required under puhca to pay dividends only from retained earnings  and some must comply with covenant restrictions under credit agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios 
the articles of incorporation of xcel energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding 
under the provisions  dividend payments may be restricted if xcel energy s capitalization ratio on a holding company basis only  ie  not on a consolidated basis is less than percent 
for these purposes  the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock plus surplus divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long term debt 
based on this definition  xcel energy s capitalization ratio at dec 
  was percent 
therefore  the restrictions do not place any effective limit on xcel energy s ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than percent or will be reduced to less than percent through dividends other than dividends payable in common stock  distributions or acquisitions of xcel energy common stock 
capital sources xcel energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt  long term debt  common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
registered holding companies and certain of their subsidiaries  including xcel energy and its utility subsidiaries  are limited under puhca in their ability to issue securities 
such registered holding companies and their subsidiaries may not issue securities unless authorized by an exemptive rule or order of the sec 
because xcel energy does not qualify for any of the main exemptive rules  it has received financing authority from the sec under puhca for various financing arrangements 
xcel energy s current financing authority permits it  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  to issue through june   up to billion of common stock and long term debt and billion of short term debt at the holding company level 
xcel energy has issued billion of long term debt and common stock  including the million credit facility that closed in november that replaced the previous million facility 
on dec 
  xcel energy filed an application with the sec requesting additional financing authorization beyond june  if approved  the new financing authority would extend through june  the new application requests the authority for xcel energy to issue up to billion of new long term debt  common equity and equity linked securities and billion of short term debt securities during the new authorization period  provided that the aggregate amount of long term debt  common equity  equity linked and short term debt securities issued during the new authorization period does not exceed billion 
xcel energy expects the sec to issue an order prior to the expiration of the existing authorization 
xcel energy s ability to issue securities under the financing authority is subject to a number of conditions 
one of the conditions of the financing authority is that xcel energy s consolidated ratio of common equity to total capitalization be at least percent 
as of dec 
  the common equity ratio was approximately percent 
additional conditions require that a security to be issued that is rated  be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency
