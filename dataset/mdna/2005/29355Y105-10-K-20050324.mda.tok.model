item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a medical products company engaged in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of percutaneous vessel introducers  safety needles and related vascular delivery products  the design  development  manufacture and marketing of implantable stimulation leads  lead delivery systems  and lead accessories for cardiac rhythm management  neuromodulation  and hearing restoration markets  and the manufacture of medical devices and components for other medical product companies on a contract basis 
on october   we completed our acquisition of the operating assets of bci from biomec inc and began to operate the bci business through our wholly owned subsidiary  enpath lead technologies  inc elt 
we paid million less assumed liabilities of approximately million plus a working capital adjustment of  in addition  we made a contingent payment of million on march   based on the final sales results of the acquired bci business 
this payment consisted of million in cash and million in common stock  shares per share 
we will also make a second contingent payment on march   which is based on the increase in proprietary sales in over  as defined in the asset purchase agreement 
this contingent payment totals  and will be paid out as  in cash and  in common stock 
we will issue  shares valued at per share based upon a pre agreed formula see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further details 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the amount of the contingent payment is to be doubled if  on or before december   elt executed supply agreements with one or more specified customers having minimum terms specified in the asset purchase agreement 
the company has determined that the conditions for doubling were not met and notified biomec 
under the asset purchase agreement  biomec has the right to review the enpath documentation with respect to determination of the contingent payment 
if biomec disputes the amount due to it under the contingent payment  the asset purchase agreement establishes a dispute resolution mechanism under which the matter may be referred to a third party accounting firm 
biomec has requested  and the company has delivered  supporting documentation with respect to the computation of the contingent payment 
during  enpath medical  inc operated as two divisions the enpath delivery systems division eds  formerly medamicus  inc and the enpath lead technologies division elt  formerly bci 
the divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment the manufacture and sale of medical devices 
the divisions have similar technology  manufacturing  customers and regulatory activities and we have combined our sales and marketing and research and development activities to take advantage of similarities in customers and product development 
effective january   the divisional structure was eliminated and we now operate as one organization located in two facilities 
our consolidated sales were million  consisting of million from eds and million from elt 
sales at eds increased million compared to primarily due to increased sales of new and existing introducer products to both new and existing customers 
sales at elt increased million compared to due to only including two months of post acquisition revenue in our consolidated results 
comparing full year to full year elt bci sales  sales actually declined from million to million  primarily due to lower sales of accessories to our largest elt customer 
our consolidated gross profit was million  consisting of million from eds and million from elt 
gross profit at eds increased million compared to primarily due to increased sales levels and improved manufacturing efficiencies in gross profit at elt increased million compared to primarily due to only including two months of post acquisition gross profit in our consolidated results 
comparing full year to full year elt bci gross profit  gross profit actually declined from million to million  primarily due to lower sales and correspondingly higher amounts of unapplied overhead included in cost of goods sold 
our consolidated expenses were million  consisting of million of research and development expenses  million of sales  general and administrative expenses and  of interest and other expenses 
additionally  eds booked a one time impairment charge on its safety needle investment of million to write down the value of assets related to the safety needle product line 
as a result  we had a net loss of million or

vessel introducers enable physicians to create a conduit through which they can insert infusion catheters  implantable ports and pacemaker leads into a blood vessel 
in addition to this core traditional introducer product line  we have developed and manufacture advanced delivery introducers that have fixed curve or articulating distal tip sections that can be manipulated to enable the health care professional to access parts of the patient s anatomy such as the left ventricle of the heart that cannot be reached by traditional introducers 
these sophisticated advanced delivery introducers are designed and manufactured to meet the unique needs of each procedure being performed 
we also manufacture safety products  primarily a safety needle that can be retracted into a protective sheath while still in the patient  greatly reducing the possibility of a needle stick and infection to the health care professional after the needle has been in contact with a patient s blood see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information 
finally  we perform contract manufacturing and engineering services under which we design and manufacture products at our facilities to third party customer specifications 
lead technologies we develop and manufacture proprietary and custom designed implantable stimulation leads  adapters and delivery systems for the cardiac and neuromodulation markets 
we also provide laser processing and contract manufacturing services for our medical device customers for implantable and disposable devices 
results of operations delivery systems  and net sales were million in  million in and million in  representing a increase and a decrease  respectively 
sales of our core introducer products were million in  million in and million in  representing a and increase  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the launch of the flowguard tm valved introducer into the cardiac pacemaker market which included a large initial stocking order  as well as strong orders for introducers from our two largest customers during the last half of the increase in was primarily due to continued growth in sales to both new and existing customers 
we had hoped to see a larger increase in our introducer product sales during with the launch of our flowguard valved introducer in the second quarter 
unfortunately  due to a design issue related to the handle resin  we voluntarily pulled the product off the market in june and spent the remainder of resolving the issue 
we expect introducer sales in to increase slightly over the level as we continue to penetrate smaller market share customers with the flowguard product 
sales of our advanced delivery products were million in  million in and million in  representing a increase and a decrease  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to several special orders of left ventricle lead delivery system lvlds procedural kits that shipped to medtronic in without these special orders  sales would have declined from primarily due to lower component sales to medtronic for these kits 
the decrease in was primarily due to medtronic transferring the manufacturing of lvlds kits from us to its own facility beginning in late we are continuing our work with several different customers on sophisticated delivery catheters that will have utility in the treatment of atrial fibrillation  percutaneous mitral valve repair  carotid stent placement  and a variety of renal and peripheral interventions 
each of these delivery catheters is based on our proprietary technology and could potentially be used in new treatments being developed by our customers addressing large patient populations 
some of our partners are further along than others  and on track to bring their therapeutic device to market sometime in we expect advanced delivery product sales to increase in the second half of as our customers begin to launch their new devices into the marketplace with our delivery systems 
sales of safety needles were  in   in and  in  representing a decrease and a increase  respectively see note of the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information 
the decrease in is primarily due to the reasons described below 
during and  sales of our safety needles had been growing  but at a much slower pace than we originally anticipated 
we launched the safety needle in all of medtronic s kits for united states distribution in our initial launch strategy was to place a safety needle in all kits for united states distribution and after a period of time when all customers had been exposed to the safety needle  we would then offer an option of kits with and without safety needles 
since then  sales of kits with safety needles have dropped precipitously 
cook incorporated launched our safety needle in february and purchased a substantial amount of inventory 
we had discussions with these two customers during the second quarter of to assess their expectations in the marketplace regarding safety needles 
cook advised us that it had experienced only modest sales of safety needles 
while we remain cautiously optimistic that the federal mandate requiring the use of safety needles in all health care related procedures will result in a future favorable revenue stream for our safety needle  the market s slow adoption rate no longer justified the level of investment we had in safety needle intellectual property rights and equipment 
as a result  we determined  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  that the current fair value of our safety needle assets at june  was  this resulted in a one time impairment charge of approximately million which we reflected in the results from operations for the three months ended june  we expect sales of safety needles to remain soft for the foreseeable future and we are continuing to evaluate our options for this product 
on december   we had inventory of safety needles totaling  which amounted to of total inventory 
we continue to sell safety needles on a monthly basis  reducing the inventory levels of these products 
we estimate that we have a month supply of safety needle inventory on hand and will not be purchasing any additional components or manufacturing any additional needles in the near future 
other sales  consisting of contract manufacturing  engineering services and freight charges were million in  million in and million in because of the small number of contract manufacturing customers we serve and the volatility of engineering service projects  this category of sales will vary from one year to the next 
the decrease in was primarily due to decreased engineering service sales  partially off set by increases in contract manufacturing sales during the comparable periods 
the increase in was primarily due to increased engineering service sales  partially off set by decreases in contract manufacturing sales during the comparable periods 
gross profit totaled million in  million in and million in  representing a increase and a decrease  respectively 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in  in and in gross profit as a percent of sales increased in compared to primarily due to the resolution of several issues that impacted these issues included the recall of the flowguard product due to resin issues that have been resolved  the manufacturing by hand of safety needles which are now made on automated equipment  and the high levels of depreciation and amortization on our safety needle assets related to the sales of safety needles 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased in compared to primarily due to the drastic reduction in our high gross profit medtronic advanced delivery product sales 
in addition  we made a conscious decision to retain all of our production staff while we resolved the flowguard resin issue and we used the time to conduct training and rearrange our production floor for greater efficiency 
as a result  we had higher manufacturing overhead costs than would be typical for the lower level of production we generated 
we also had relatively high fixed costs related to the amortization of our investment in obtaining the rights to the arterial safety needle market  as well as depreciation on the automated safety needle assembly equipment beginning in april  as compared to sales of safety needles 
we also incurred additional costs in the first quarter of when we manually assembled safety needles  as well as additional costs in the second quarter of when we wrote off inventory associated with the flowguard valved introducer 
we expect our margins to approximate in as we continue to launch the smaller sizes of flowguard and other new products to the marketplace 
lead technologies  and because we did not acquire the assets of this division until october   the comparative numbers shown for were taken directly from the unaudited records of bci and the comparative numbers for were taken from the audited financial statements of bci 
these figures are shown in order to give a point of reference to the current year results 
the percent changes are shown in the table below in order to help clarify the comparative results 
the amounts for and from october to december  were included in our consolidated results 
sales category in thousands full year pro forma full year october to december full year proprietary products contract manufacturing contract development other total sales gross profit gross profit as percent of sales percent change full yr to full yr full yr to partial yr full yr to full yr total sales proprietary product sales contract manufacturing sales contract development other sales gross profit total sales were million in  million in million included in consolidated sales and million in not included in consolidated sales 
sales of proprietary products  consisting of implantable stimulation leads  lead delivery systems and adaptors were million in  million in  included in consolidated sales and million in not included in consolidated sales 
the increase in was primarily due to increased sales of epicardial leads into the growing crt market and the launch of several is adaptors for a key customer 
the increase in was primarily due to a three fold growth in our proprietary myopore epicardial lead sales and increased demand for our is adapters 
high growth in the myopore lead sales was driven by the rapid growth of the crt market and the demand for sutureless epicardial leads for left ventricular pacing in failed transvenous left ventricular placements 
we expect that sales in will increase due to european approval of our myopore rx epicardial steroid lead 
the launch of our fastac flex delivery tool for improved efficiency when placing the epicardial lead will also help to increase sales in sales of contract manufacturing products  consisting primarily of lead accessories were million in  million in million included in consolidated sales  and million in not included in consolidated sales 
the decrease in was primarily due to our largest customer continuing to adjust an inventory overstock situation and we look for reduced orders to continue through the first quarter of additionally  as part of our overall strategy to focus on higher margin proprietary products  we discontinued several low margin contract manufacturing projects 
the increase in was primarily due to the growth in pacing accessories driven by our largest customer s increase in stocking levels and higher demand due to that customer s sales force expansion 
additional revenue growth was due to increased demand for oem procedure kits  laser processing of prosthetic discs  and the successful start up of a hemostatic powder filling operation 
we expect that contract manufacturing sales in will be lower than due to the shift to proprietary products and the continued reduced orders for accessory products from our largest customer 
other sales consisting of our contract development work and freight were  in   in  included in consolidated sales and  in not included in consolidated sales 
contract development work in and was primarily related to development of stimulation leads for a variety of emerging neurostimulation applications 
these co development efforts have been initiated to fuel longer term manufacturing growth tied to development and supply arrangements with emerging therapy start up companies 
gross profit totaled million in  million in  included in consolidated results and  in not included in consolidated results 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in  in included in consolidated results and in not included in consolidated results 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the low level of sales during the year  causing our manufacturing staff to be underutilized which resulted in a significant portion of our overhead not being allocated to production 
gross profits were also affected by the amortization of identifiable intangible assets totaling  in compared to  in without the amortization charge  gross profits as a percent of sales for would have been 
gross profit grew in primarily because of increased sales of our higher margin proprietary products 
other changes that helped improve gross profit in included the implementation of cost reduction efforts in strategic supply  manufacturing processing improvements and increased efficiencies in the production work force due to hiring  training  and retention programs 
we were also able to pass on price increases to customers of our proprietary products that had not seen price increases in several years 
we do not expect margins to increase substantially until we launch our new fastac flex and myopore rx products to the market in combined expenses  and research and development research and development expenses were million in million for eds  million for elt  million in million for eds   for elt and million in all eds totaling  and of sales  respectively 
the large increase in was primarily due to inclusion of the elt expenses for all of compared to only two months in and none in included in the amounts was  and  for and  respectively  of identifiable intangible asset amortization related to the bci acquisition 
the increase in over for delivery systems was due to development work on its family of proprietary advanced delivery introducers  as well as development work related to partnerships with a number of other medical device companies working on therapies that will utilize our delivery systems 
the increase in over was due to increasing our engineering staff and continuing expenditures on a variety of new product development activities 
the increase in over for lead technologies was primarily due to activities related to validating the improved performance of our anti inflammatory steroid epicardial lead and the submission of our application to the fda for marketing clearance approximately million 
recent discussions with the fda have indicated that they consider the original least burdensome approach ie a paper pma with no requirement for prospective human clinical data as not being a robust clinical argument for the approval of this lead 
we are attempting to clarify the scope and timing of a human clinical that the fda would find acceptable and then assess the feasibility of conducting such a clinical trial 
in addition to the steroid epicardial lead activities  we also spent approximately  on continued development of the fastac flex tool and new is adaptors 
we expect research and development expenditures for to be approximately of sales as we continue our efforts to develop and launch these new products 
our long term goal is to spend approximately of our sales on research and development activities 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and  in totaling  and of sales  respectively 
the large increase in was primarily due to the inclusion of the elt expenses for all of compared to only two months in and none in had we included elt expenses for all of  the amount of spending would have totaled approximately million 
included in the amounts was  and  for and  respectively  of identifiable intangible asset amortization related to the bci acquisition 
the increase in from was primarily due to the costs associated with combining our sales and marketing group for the two divisions 
on march  we announced the formation of a single sales and marketing group for our two divisions and named james mellor as senior vice president with overall responsibility for that effort 
james reed was appointed to the new position of director of sales for the combined group 
we did not expect cost savings as a result of putting the two groups together  but rather a more focused and effective sales effort  especially with the large cardiac rhythm management companies 
we incurred some significant expenses related to web site and marketing material development that increased expenses in approximately 
we also added one additional person to the group in the increase in from was primarily due to increased spending on salaries  trade shows and travel  partially off set by a decrease in commission expense 
we had been developing an internal sales and marketing department over the past two years and added a number of positions since january of to help drive the sales and marketing efforts for our new products while eliminating our independent sales representative relationships 
with the addition of these positions  we attended more trade shows to build awareness of our products and incurred higher travel costs than in past years 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to be approximately of sales for general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in totaling  and of sales  respectively 
the large increase in was primarily due to several factors 
first  we included the elt expenses for all of compared to only months in and none in had we included elt expenses for all of  the amount of spending would have totaled approximately million 
included in the amounts was  and  for and  respectively  of identifiable intangible asset amortization related to the bci acquisition 
second  we increased spending on salaries  accounting and legal services  investor relations  name change and corporate integration activities 
compliance with sarbanes oxley section requirements increased our accounting and legal costs significantly  and we expect these higher costs to continue for all of and beyond 
we also have increased our investor relations activities in conjunction with our acquisition of bci in order to expand awareness to a growing group of investors 
finally  we have incurred additional costs and expenses in connection with the integration of our new elt division and the name change to enpath medical 
the increase in from was primarily due to increased spending on salaries  accounting and legal fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  investor relations  depreciation  consulting services and insurance 
we expect general and administrative expenses to total approximately of sales for other expenses interest income was  in   in and  in and interest expense was   and  during the same respective periods 
interest income decreased primarily due to lower cash balances resulting from the use of excess cash to fund the acquisition of bci in  as well as lower interest rates compared to interest expense increased primarily due to the interest on the million note payable that was put in place in october to help fund the bci acquisition  as well as interest payments on our line of credit borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of  compared to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities during was million  consisting of a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash items of depreciation and amortization of million  safety needle asset impairment charge of million  non cash consulting services of  offset in part by the net change in our deferred tax asset of  we also had a net change in operating assets and liabilities of  net cash used in investing activities during was million  consisting primarily of the purchase of equipment totaling million  additions to intangible assets totaling  and cash paid for the bci acquisition of million 
net cash used in financing activities during was  we made principal payments on capital leases of  and payments on our note payable to bank of million 
this was offset by proceeds from option exercises of  and proceeds on our line of credit totaling  on october   we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five year term loan of million  which was used to finance a portion of the bci acquisition  and a million line of credit  million of which was available at december  the borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis 
the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends without the consent of the lender 
at december   we were in violation of certain of these covenants  due to the million safety needle asset impairment charge see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
these violations were subsequently waived by the bank on february  payments on the term loan consist of monthly principal payments of  plus interest at libor plus 
these payments commenced in november the line of credit bears interest at libor plus with no minimum interest due and expires on april  the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
there were borrowings of  under the line of credit at december  as of december   our working capital was million  or a current ratio of to  compared to working capital of million or a current ratio of to as of december  accounts receivable decreased  primarily due to faster collections at our elt facility in days in versus days in 
inventory increased  during as we moved to a new distribution strategy of maintaining higher levels of finished goods for our customers 
while this strategy has the short term impact of increasing our inventories  it significantly simplifies the process our customers go through when they order our products 
we had cash totaling  as of december  because we have been utilizing our bank line of credit  we have been using excess cash to pay down the credit line in order to minimize interest expense 
we will continue to maintain a small cash balance while we utilize our line of credit 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total long term debt  including interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations we also have a commercial commitment as described below other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at december  date of expiration line of credit april  we had  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  in connection with our acquisition of bci  we are required to make an additional payment of  related to the contingent payment that is due on march  in february  we entered into an amendment to the asset purchase agreement with biomec inc  under which we agreed to pay the contingent payment as stock and cash 
in addition  the value of the stock to be issued in conjunction with the contingent payment would be valued at no less than or more than per share 
based on these parameters  the contingent payment will be made in the form of  in cash and  in common stock an estimated  shares 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the amount of the contingent payment is to be doubled if  on or before december   elt executed supply agreements with one or more specified customers having minimum terms specified in the asset purchase agreement 
the company has determined that the conditions for doubling were not met and notified biomec 
under the asset purchase agreement  biomec has the right to review the enpath documentation with respect to determination of the contingent payment 
if biomec disputes the amount due to it under the contingent payment  the asset purchase agreement establishes a dispute resolution mechanism under which the matter may be referred to a third party accounting firm 
biomec has requested  and the company has delivered  supporting documentation with respect to the computation of the contingent payment 
while we believe that we have sufficient resources with our current cash and credit facility to make payments required under the acquisition  to meet our long term debt obligations and fund our planned operations for fiscal  there is no assurance that we will not need additional capital in the future 
sources of additional capital may include additional debt financing or the sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain additional capital on favorable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
our management analyzes accounts receivable  historical write offs as bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debt expense and our reserve for doubtful accounts of  should be adequate for any exposure to loss in our december  accounts receivable 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory inventories  which are composed of purchased parts and subassemblies  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or slow moving inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
we have established reserves for excess and slow moving inventories and believe the reserve of  at december  is adequate 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets including intangible assets with finite lives as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment of finite life assets requires us to make estimates of the fair value of our long lived assets  primarily based on projected future cash flows using discount rates determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model or another valuation technique 
for indefinite life intangibles  we determine whether the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds its expected future cash flows 
if we determine that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  we will be required to reduce the valuation of these assets on our financial statements 
significant intangible assets include the following goodwill the estimate of the fair value of the goodwill that resulted from our recent acquisition of bci and the annual impairment test of this asset are significant estimates and require judgment in projecting future cash flows as well as considering the current amount recorded of million 
safety needle the determination of the safety needle intangible and equipment impairments during was a significant estimate in in addition  the realization of our remaining investment in the license agreement and manufacturing equipment related to the safety needle aggregate net balance of  at december  is dependent upon attaining a sustained level of sales of this product 
we currently are comfortable projecting a level of future sales that is sufficient to allow us to fully realize the adjusted investment we have remaining in the safety needle inventory and equipment 
however  if actual sales fail to reach these levels  our adjusted investment in this product may not be fully realizable in the future see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
other intangibles with finite lives other intangibles with finite lives consist primarily of purchased technology  trade name  patents  customer relationships and trademarks aggregate net balance of million at december  are being amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
allocation of purchase price paid for the bci acquisition as a result of our acquisition of bci  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k  we were required to allocate the consideration paid for bci between tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development ipr d  and goodwill 
the value assigned to ipr d was determined by identifying those acquired specific in process research and development projects that would be continued and for which a technological feasibility had not been established at the acquisition date  b there was no alternative future use  and c the fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability 
we were required to make significant estimates to determine the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the intangible assets 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets was determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rates used in calculating the present value of the various intangibles were in accordance with accepted valuation methods and for ipr d also included the consideration of the risks of not achieving commercial feasibility 
the goodwill that resulted from this acquisition represents the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the total tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
in process research and development ipr d development projects  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  were classified as in process research and development 
the purchase price assigned to those projects was immediately expensed on the acquisition date and was reflected as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the in process research and development projects were as follows steroid leads million  adapters million and an implant tool 
the estimated value of these projects was determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the discount rates used considered the stage of completion and the risk surrounding the successful development and commercialization of each of the purchased in process technology projects 
some of the original assumptions related to these projects were as follows initial assumptions october  leads tool adaptor costs incurred as of estimated cost to complete percent complete dollars months spent up to estimated months to complete percent complete months year revenues estimated to begin regulatory approval received no no no the discount rates used in valuing the developed  core and in process technologies ranged from to 
a higher discount rate was used to value the in process research and development  due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process projects  fda approval  and the market acceptance of the products 
the percentage of completion for each of the in process projects was determined using costs incurred to date on each project as compared to the remaining estimated costs to be incurred to bring each of the projects to technological feasibility 
we believe that the three in process projects described above will reach technological feasibility 
however  because of the risks associated with the commercial viability of these products  there can be no assurance that these projects will actually achieve commercialization 
these risks include the delay or failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or the failure to achieve market acceptance 
as of march   we had received european approval to begin selling the steroid lead through one oem partner  but had not yet obtained regulatory approvals to market the other products 
updated information related to these three projects is summarized below status on december  leads tool adaptor costs incurred as of estimated cost to complete percent complete dollars months spent up to estimated months to complete percent complete months year revenues estimated to begin regulatory approval received no no no the scope of the adaptor project has been significantly reduced due to entering into an exclusive arrangement with a major crm company for is adaptors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued statement no

all our forward looking statements  whether written or oral are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
in addition  we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
risk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
we have three major customers and depend on these customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
medtronic accounted for approximately  and  cr bard accounted for approximately  and  and st 
jude medical accounted for approximately  and of our total sales from operations in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expected near term future growth in sales will be tied in part to these customers sales of their existing products  as well as new products incorporating our products as components 
because we anticipate that sales of our components and kits to medtronic for use in medtronic s left ventricle lead delivery systems lvlds will continue to decrease  we are attempting to expand our customer base and our product offerings 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in making sales to new customers  increasing sales to existing customers other than medtronic or developing and marketing new products 
to the extent that we do not expand our customer base and product offerings  sales to medtronic and our other key customers will continue to account for a major portion of our revenues  making us vulnerable to the risks described below 
we anticipate that our concentration of business with medtronic will approximate in with our other two customers making up approximately and  respectively 
on october   we entered into a supply agreement with medtronic that requires medtronic to purchase exclusively from us all of its requirements for introducer kits manufactured by us for a period of five years 
there are no minimum purchase obligations under the supply agreement for our current products or any future products we may develop 
if sales of medtronic s products that incorporate our products as components decrease or if medtronic does not develop new products incorporating our products as components  future sales of our products to medtronic and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
further  any action by medtronic to discontinue any of its products that incorporate our products  to redesign or change the technical requirements for its products so that our products would not meet those requirements  or to otherwise limit or discontinue its purchases from us would have a material adverse impact on sales of our products and  consequently  our financial results 
in addition  under the supply agreement  if we fail to supply certain products  medtronic may manufacture and sell these products or have these products manufactured by another party 
our failure to supply these products would result in a loss of sales to medtronic and would have a material adverse impact on our revenues 
moreover  the supply agreement establishes the pricing medtronic receives with respect to each product and provides that if we extend more favorable pricing to any other customer  that same pricing will also be extended to medtronic 
a reduction in our pricing with medtronic would likely result in a decline in our overall revenue 
we may need additional capital in the future 
we had  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  in connection with our acquisition of bci  we are required to make an additional payment of  related to the contingent payment that is due on march  in february  we entered into an amendment to the asset purchase agreement with biomec inc  under which we agreed to pay the contingent payment as stock and cash 
in addition  the value of the stock to be issued in conjunction with the contingent payment would be valued at no less than or more than per share 
based on these parameters  the contingent payment will be made in the form of  in cash and  in common stock an estimated  shares 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the amount of the contingent payment is to be doubled if  on or before december   elt executed supply agreements with one or more specified customers having minimum terms specified in the asset purchase agreement 
the company has determined that the conditions for doubling were not met and notified biomec 
under the asset purchase agreement  biomec has the right to review the enpath documentation with respect to determination of the contingent payment 
if biomec disputes the amount due to it under the contingent payment  the asset purchase agreement establishes a dispute resolution mechanism under which the matter may be referred to a third party accounting firm 
biomec has requested  and the company has delivered  supporting documentation with respect to the computation of the contingent payment 
on october   we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five year term loan of million  which was used to finance a portion of the bci acquisition  and a million line of credit  million of which was available at december  the borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis 
the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends without the consent of the lender 
at december   we were in violation of certain of these covenants  due to the million safety needle asset impairment charge see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
these violations were subsequently waived by the bank on february  while we believe that we have sufficient resources with our current cash and the new credit facility to make payments required under the acquisition  meet our long term debt obligations and fund our planned operations for fiscal  there is no assurance that we will not need additional capital in the future 
sources of additional capital may include additional debt financing or the sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain additional capital on favorable terms 
we have only attained profitability recently and had a net loss of million in we became a publicly traded company in and incurred losses in each of the years from to for the years ended december     and  we reported net income of  million  million   and a net loss of million  respectively 
net income for included million related to the sale of the gynecology division  as well as recognition of income tax benefit of  resulting from the elimination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
in  elt bci was profitable for the first time in many years 
however  our results only included income from elt from october  to december  and included a one time write off of million related to the purchase of in process research and development costs associated with the acquisition 
the net loss for included a one time charge of million related to safety needle asset impairment 
there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate the operation of elt and regain and maintain profitable operations in the future 
the government heavily regulates our business 
the medical products that we sell and propose to sell are subject to regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in certain states and foreign countries 
the process of complying with requirements of the fda and other agencies can be costly and time consuming 
we have received clearance from the fda to market our vessel introducer products  safety needle  epicardial lead and implant tool 
as discussed above in products lead technologies  we currently have a pma submission pending with the fda related to our epicardial steroid lead  and a k submission related to our steerable introducer product 
there is no assurance that any future additional clearance can be obtained 
in addition  once obtained  these clearances are subject to review  and later discovery of previous unknown problems may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are also subject to certain fda regulations governing manufacturing practices  packaging and labeling 
non compliance with these regulations can result in product recalls or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
we depend on patents and proprietary technology 
our success may depend on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we have united states and foreign patents issued related to various aspects of vessel introducers and stimulation leads 
there can be no assurance that any future patent protection will be granted  that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and therefore may be highly uncertain 
we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
we depend on our key personnel 
failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder our research and development and manufacturing efforts 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of key technical and senior management personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified managerial and technical personnel 
the inability to retain or attract qualified personnel could have a significant negative effect upon our efforts and thereby materially harm our business and financial condition 
we face intense competition and rapid technological change 
we are faced with intense competition and rapid technological and industry change and  if our competitors existing products or new products are more effective or superior to our products  the commercial opportunity for our products will be reduced or eliminated 
we face intense competition from other device manufacturers  many of whom are significantly larger and have greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we believe there will be intense price competition for products developed in our markets 
our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do 
such developments could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition 
even if we are able to compete successfully  we may not be able to do so in a profitable manner 
the medical device industry is generally characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  and frequent new product introductions 
our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
we risk product liability claims and product recalls 
the manufacture and sale of medical products entails significant risk of product liability claims or product recalls 
our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur in connection with the clinical trials or sales of our products 
we may require increased product liability coverage as our products are commercialized 
insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  or a recall of our products  could have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our business 
we have limited sources of supply for our products 
we currently purchase  and will in the future purchase  components and raw materials from outside vendors 
although we have identified alternative suppliers for key components and raw materials  at the present time we generally use one source of supply for each component and raw material 
if a key supplier becomes unwilling or unable to supply any such component or raw material in a timely manner  or if approval of a proposed supplier is delayed  withheld or withdrawn  we could experience delays in obtaining alternative suppliers  which may adversely affect our business 
we have a limited public market for our common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
the average daily trading volume approximated  shares per day in   shares per day in   shares per day in   shares per day in and  shares per day through march  there can be no assurance that an active market will exist for our common stock  or that our common stock could be sold without a significant negative impact on the publicly quoted price per share 
our future operating results may fluctuate 
if our revenue declines in a quarter compared to the revenue in the previous quarter  our earnings will likely decline as well  due to the fact that many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
in some future quarter or quarters  due to a decrease or shortfall in revenue or for some other reason  our operating results likely will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly 
our research and development projects may not reach technological feasibility 
we are planning on spending approximately million in to continue the development of several new products 
these products include the epicardial steroid lead  the implant tool  the next generation of adaptors  steerable delivery sheaths and ergonomic handle and steerable catheters 
while we believe that these products will reach technological feasibility  because of the risks associated with the commercial viability of these products  there can be no assurance that these projects will actually achieve commercialization 
such risks include the delay or failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or the failure to achieve market acceptance 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity 
our earnings have not been materially affected by changes in interest rates on our floating interest rate debt less than  for because interest rates remained fairly stable during the year and we only started utilizing our line of credit beginning in june based on our current borrowings and anticipated line of credit requirements in  an increase of basis points in prevailing interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by less than
