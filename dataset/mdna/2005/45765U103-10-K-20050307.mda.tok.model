table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued direct alliance net sales and earnings from operations for the year ended december  declined and  respectively 
the decline was due primarily to the wind down of a client relationship that ended  as scheduled  in may additionally  we renegotiated fee structures as part of multi year contract renewals with two of direct alliance s largest clients 
although new programs typically take several months to contribute to profitability  we were pleased that direct alliance successfully added three new clients during our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
members of our senior management have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and either different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur periodically  that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales recognition the majority of our sales are product sales  which are covered by our sales agreements containing our standard terms and conditions 
sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
usual sales terms are free on board fob shipping point  meaning title and risk of loss are passed to the customer and delivery has occurred when the product is shipped 
persuasive evidence of the arrangement and fixed and determinable sales prices are documented via written sales contracts  purchase orders or both 
based on these criteria  the majority of our sales represent product sales recognized upon shipment 
from time to time  in connection with the sale of products and services  we enter into contracts that contain multiple elements  sales terms of fob destination  or other non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting  including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple deliverables  whether the delivered item s has stand alone value to the customer and when to recognize the sale 
we recognize sales for delivered items only when all of the following criteria are satisfied the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales or products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
for  sales of services represented less than of our net sales 
portions of our services that accompany product are performed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product 
in these circumstances  net sales for both the product and services are recognized upon shipment 
in other cases  net sales of 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued services are typically negotiated separately and recorded as the services are performed 
net sales attributable to arrangements that include warehousing product for our customers are deferred until the product is shipped 
we also sell certain third party service contracts and certain software licenses for which we are not the primary obligor 
these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition because we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership in the transaction and thus are recorded on a net sales recognition basis 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers or vendors  we must evaluate whether the sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
under gross sales recognition  we are the primary obligor and the entire selling price is recorded in sales with our cost to the third party service provider or vendor recorded in costs of goods sold 
under net sales recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction with no costs of goods sold 
presently  the majority of our outsourcing arrangements are service fee based  meaning that we derive net sales based primarily upon a cost plus arrangement in addition to a percentage of the sales price from products sold 
revenues from service fee based programs and direct costs related to the generation of those revenues are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
as an accommodation to select service fee based program clients  we may also purchase and immediately resell products to our clients for ultimate sale to their customers 
these pass through product sales are completed at little or no gross margin and are included in net sales and cost of goods sold 
under certain outsourcing arrangements  we may take title to inventories of products and assume credit risk associated with sales to the end user 
revenues and the related costs from the sales of such products are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
we make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates 
the reserve for sales returns as of december  and included  and  respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
should customers return a different amount of product than originally estimated  future net sales are adjusted to reflect historical return rates 
severance  restructuring and acquisition integration activities we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in severance and restructuring activities which require us to utilize significant estimates related primarily to employee termination benefits  estimated costs to terminate leases or remaining lease commitments on unused facilities  net of estimated subleases 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  adjustments to severance and restructuring expense in subsequent periods would be necessary 
facilities based costs recorded in represent contractual payments under long term leases for which we are actively pursuing opportunities to negotiate a termination of these leases and have recorded the obligations as current accrued liabilities 
we expect these restructuring activities to have a positive effect on future operating results and liquidity 
we do not expect the remaining estimates to increase in the future  however  if we are successful in negotiating early terminations of these leases  the remaining estimates may decrease 
a detailed description of our severance  restructuring and acquisition integration activities and remaining accruals for these activities at december  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no united states taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
in  due to the historical and expected profitability of our uk operations  we reduced the valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million 
additional information about the reduction in the valuation allowance can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any and compares the fair value to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
annually  during the fourth quarter of each year  we assess whether goodwill is impaired 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
determining the fair value of reporting units  as well as identifiable assets and liabilities  uses our estimates of market capitalization allocation  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal or in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  million net of taxes  which represented the entire goodwill balance recorded at insight uk 
this impairment resulted from a decline in insight uk s operating performance  which caused its book value to exceed its fair value at the time of the assessment 
additional information about our goodwill and goodwill impairment assessments can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we identify potential impairment of goodwill through our strategic reviews of our reporting units and operations performed in conjunction with restructuring actions 
deterioration of our business in a geographic region or within a reporting unit in the future could lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
when impairment is identified  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
allowances for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance is determined using estimated losses on customer receivables based on historical write offs  evaluation of the aging of the receivables and the current economic environment 
should our customers circumstances change or actual collections of customer and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be necessary 
see further information on our allowance for doubtful accounts in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
write downs of inventories we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions by manufacturers to discontinue certain products or product lines can affect our decision to write down inventories 
if our assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
the determination of fair values requires us to make significant 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to acquired intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
consideration received from vendors we receive payments and credits from vendors  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  which we adopted january   vendor consideration received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as a reduction to costs of goods sold 
vendor consideration received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated to inventories based on the applicable incentives from each vendor and is recorded in cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold 
vendor consideration received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place only if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs 
consideration that exceeds the specific  incremental  identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold

interest income 
interest income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  was generated through short term investments

interest expense 
interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities  which were used to finance an acquisition during interest expense has decreased due to decreases in interest bearing debt incurred and assumed in connection with the acquisition and decreases in interest rates

net cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operations for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
in  cash flows from operations resulted primarily from net earnings before depreciation and the gain on the sale of investment in plusnet  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories due to increased sales compared to the prior year 
cash flows from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net earnings before depreciation  a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in customer payments in advance of shipment  offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts receivable at december  was primarily due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in customer payments in advance of shipment was due to payments received from customers for inventory segregated pursuant to binding customer contracts for which net sales will be recognized when the sales recognition criteria are met 
the increase in inventories at december  was due to increases in opportunistic purchases  increases in inventories of certain categories due to anticipated product shortages  changes in a manufacturer s buying programs  and an increase in inventories to service larger corporate customers 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to timing of payments at year end 
the million increase in receivables from equity method investee primarily represented receivables from et  an equity method investee  for amounts due to insight north america for products purchased

our consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the years ended december   and are as follows days outstanding in ending accounts receivable dsos inventory turns excluding inventories not available for sale days outstanding in ending accounts payable dpos dsos increased in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  due to a greater percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of to large enterprise clients  who generally are granted longer payment terms 
the decrease in inventory turns resulted primarily from an increase in inventories due to increases in opportunistic purchases and inventory purchased for large enterprise customer projects 
the million of inventories not available for sale at december  represents inventories segregated pursuant to binding customer contracts  which will be recorded as net sales when the criteria for sales recognition are met 
dpos decreased in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  due to increases in opportunities to take early pay discounts from suppliers and timing of payments at year end 
if sales continue to increase in the future  we expect that cash flow from operations will be used  at least partially  to fund working capital as we typically increase balances in our inventories and pay our suppliers  in order to take advantage of supplier discounts  on average terms that are shorter than the average terms granted to our customers

we expect capital expenditures in the next twelve months to be between million and million 
these expenditures will primarily relate to the purchase of an office facility in bloomingdale  illinois  which we currently lease  for million  the expansion of our  square foot distribution facility in hanover park  illinois to  square feet to accommodate future growth  purchases of software and internal development of software enhancements related to our it systems  and purchases of computer equipment

pursuant to fasb financial interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  we have evaluated our investments in privately held companies and have determined there were no significant unconsolidated variable interest entities as of december  certain events can require a reassessment of our equity method investments to determine if they are variable interest entities and which of the stakeholders will be the primary beneficiaries 
as a result of such events  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities

additionally  we had no outstanding balance on our line of credit at december  acquisitions our strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing of future acquisitions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of stock  or a combination of any of the three 
inflation we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our customers  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our customers

the consensus was ratified by the fasb at their november  meeting and should be applied to a component of an enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held for sale in fiscal periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this consensus to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

factors that may affect future results and financial condition changes in the economic environment and or information technology industry may reduce demand for the products and services we sell 
our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  the condition of the it industry  shifts in demand for or availability of computer and related products and services and industry introductions of new products  upgrades or methods of distribution 
over the past few years  the computer industry in general has felt the effects of the slowdown in the united states and european economies  and we specifically experienced a decrease in demand for the products and services we sell 
net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes 
our operating results are also highly dependent upon our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales  which fluctuates due to numerous factors  including changes in prices from suppliers  changes in the amount and timing of supplier reimbursements and marketing funds that are made available  volumes of purchases  changes in customer mix  the relative mix of products sold during the period  general competitive conditions  the availability of opportunistic purchases and opportunities to increase market share 
in addition  our expense levels  including the costs and salaries incurred in connection with the hiring of account executives  are based  in part  on anticipated net sales 
therefore  we may not be able to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected net sales shortfall 
as a result  comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we rely on our suppliers for product availability  marketing funds  purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors 
the loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products 
the reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our suppliers could increase our cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to sell directly to end users  they will not limit or curtail the availability of their product to resellers  like us 
certain of the products offered from time to time by us may become subject to manufacturer allocation  which limits the number of units available to us 
our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of product or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors relative to us could cause us to be unable to fill customers orders in a timely manner  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain manufacturers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of early payment discounts  supplier reimbursements  marketing funds  price protections and rebates 
supplier funds are used to offset  among other things  cost of goods sold  marketing costs and other operating expenses 
certain of these funds are based on our volume of net sales or purchases  growth rate of net sales or purchases and marketing programs 
if we do not grow our net sales over prior periods  this could have a material negative effect on the amount of incentives offered to us by our manufacturers 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive such incentives or that we will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner  or at all 
a reduction in  the discontinuance of  a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although product is available from multiple sources via the distribution channel as well as directly from manufacturers  we rely on the manufacturers of products we offer for not only product availability and supplier reimbursements  but also for development and marketing of products that compete effectively with products of manufacturers we do not currently offer  particularly dell 
we do have the ability to sell  and periodically have sold  dell product if it is specifically requested by our customers and approved by dell  although we do not proactively advertise or offer dell products 
additionally  lenovo group limited lenovo  the leading personal computer brand in china and across asia  and ibm recently announced a definitive agreement under which lenovo will acquire ibm s personal computing division to form the world s third largest pc business 
ibm is a significant supplier to insight and the largest client of direct alliance 
although we do not know specifically how this sale will affect our current relationships with ibm or potential future relationships with lenovo  we cannot assure you that the changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on a limited number of outsourcing clients 
through our direct alliance operating segment  which represented and of our consolidated net sales and earnings from operations  respectively  for the year ended december   we perform business process outsourcing services for a small number of manufacturers in the computer and consumer electronics industry pursuant to various contracted arrangements 
for the year ended december   one outsourcing client  ibm  accounted for of direct alliance s net sales 
for the year ended december   the top three clients represented of direct alliance s net sales 
although the contracts with these clients are generally multi year contracts  these clients may cancel their contracts under certain circumstances on relatively short notice  elect to not renew them upon expiration or renew them only on terms that are less favorable to us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to replace any outsourcing clients that terminate or fail to renew their relationships with us or that we will be able to renew existing contracts on terms that are as favorable to us as the current terms 
additionally  we seek to expand our offerings both within and outside of the computer industry 
the failure to maintain current arrangements or the inability to enter into new ones within or outside the computer industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the majority of our current outsourcing clients are manufacturers in the computer industry  and are therefore subject to the same industry risks as we are with respect to our insight north america operations 
these risks may 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued negatively affect the amount of business our clients outsource to us and the performance fees we receive from clients that are based on the volume of client product we sell or process through our systems 
additionally  we do not know specifically how the acquisition of ibm s personal computing division by lenovo will affect our current relationships with ibm or potential future relationships with lenovo and we cannot assure you that the changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
actions of competitors  including manufacturers of products we sell  can negatively affect our business 
the it products and services industry is intensely competitive 
competition is based primarily on price  product availability  speed of delivery  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs and quality and breadth of product lines 
we compete with manufacturers  including manufacturers of products we sell  as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of it products and services 
product manufacturers  in particular  have programs to sell directly to the business customer  particularly larger corporate customers and  thus  are a competitive threat to us 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically directly to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through any of these competitive programs or distributed directly electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency and market share 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their product and service offerings 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the industry  and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher net sales  cost reductions  greater sales of services  which are typically at higher gross margins  or otherwise 
price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and or reduced sales or  to the extent we match such reductions  could result in reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our competitors in each of our operating segments have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional activities  offer more attractive terms to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do 
additionally  some of our competitors have lower operating cost structures  allowing them to profitably employ more aggressive pricing strategies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
disruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our customers and cause us to incur additional expenses 
we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to customers 
our ability to provide such services is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by our it systems  which affect our ability to manage our sales  customer service  distribution  inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks 
in january  we completed the it system conversion across all of insight s operations serving united states customers 
we have been  and will continue  making enhancements to the system 
in the future  we will likely convert insight s united kingdom and canadian operations to this software platform 
there can be no assurances that these enhancements or conversions will not cause disruptions in our business  and any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
although we have built redundancy into most of our systems  have documented system outage policies and procedures and have comprehensive data backup  we do not have a formal disaster recovery or business continuity plan  therefore  a substantial interruption in our it systems or in our telephone communication systems would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our public sector contracts could result in  among other things  fines or other liabilities 
net sales to public sector customers are derived from sales to federal  state and local governmental departments and agencies  as well as to educational institutions  through open market sales and various contracts

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued termination of government contracts  and suspension  debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government 
in addition  substantially all of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience or upon default 
the effect of any of these possible actions by any governmental department or agency or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
there are risks associated with international operations that are different than those inherent in the united states business 
we currently have operations in the united kingdom and canada and may expand operations further into europe 
in implementing our international strategy  we may face barriers to entry and competition from local companies and other companies that already have established global businesses  as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally 
these risks include local labor conditions and regulations  the ability to attract and retain suitable local management  exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment  potential tax exposure in repatriating earnings  and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
because we may continue to develop our international business through acquisitions  we may also be subject to risks associated with such acquisitions  including those relating to the union of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing our international business or do so in a profitable manner 
the integration and operation of future acquired businesses may disrupt our business  create additional expenses and utilize cash or debt availability 
over the past few years  we completed acquisitions in the united states  the united kingdom and canada 
these acquired operations have been fully integrated and now comprise a material portion of our business 
our strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
an acquisition involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the conversion of it systems and assimilation of operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  assumption of unknown liabilities and the potential loss of key employees and or customers of the acquired company  all of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
there is no assurance that we will identify acquisition candidates that would result in successful combinations or that any such acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the utilization of cash  amortization of expenses related to identifiable intangible assets and future impairments of acquired goodwill  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
we depend on certain key personnel 
our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract or retain highly qualified executive personnel or that any such executive personnel will be able to lead the company in directions that will increase stockholder value 
we also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  sales  service and technical personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
further  we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives 
our inability to retain such personnel or to train them rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in accounting for equity compensation will adversely affect earnings 
we have historically used stock options as a key component of our total employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options  or attract additional highly qualified personnel 
many of our outstanding employee stock options have exercise prices in excess of our current stock price 
to the extent these circumstances continue or recur  our ability to retain present employees may be adversely affected 
in addition  the fasb has finalized changes to gaap that will require expense to be recorded for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning july  moreover  applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options to employees in the future 
as a result  in addition to recording additional compensation expense  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  any of which could materially adversely affect our business

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued rapid changes in product standards may result in substantial inventory obsolescence 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements  which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete 
in addition  in order to satisfy customer demand  protect ourselves against product shortages  obtain greater purchasing discounts and react to changes in original equipment manufacturers terms and conditions  we may decide to carry relatively high inventory levels of certain products that may have limited or no return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence on these products 
our principal financing facility expires on december   and if we are unable to renew this facility or replace it on acceptable terms  we may incur higher interest expenses or your equity interests may be diluted 
our financing facilities include a million accounts receivable securitization financing facility  a million revolving line of credit and a million inventories financing facility 
the availability under each of these facilities is subject to formulas based on our eligible trade accounts receivable or inventories 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these facilities was million  and we had million available 
the accounts receivable securitization financing facility expires december   and the line of credit and inventories facility expire on december  we have no reason to believe the accounts receivable securitization financing facility will not be renewed on or before december  however  it is possible that we may be unable to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization financing facility or secure alternative financing or  if we are able to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization financing facility or secure alternative financing  it may be on less favorable terms  such as higher interest rates 
if we were unable to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization financing facility or secure alternative financing  we may be required to seek other financing alternatives such as selling additional equity securities or convertible debt securities that would dilute the equity interests of current stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations may continue to increase our costs and divert management s attention from operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of the act became law in july and since then we have made changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure  compliance practices and documentation and testing of internal controls to comply with the act 
the act also required the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  many of which are already in place 
in addition  the nasd adopted revisions to its corporate governance requirements for companies  like us  that are listed on nasdaq 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we have invested and will continue to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
this significant investment in these areas increases our legal  external and internal audit  board of directors and financial costs and diverts management time and attention from other activities 
the risk of litigation and claims of personal liability for corporate action or inaction could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain executive officers and qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on the audit committee 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims  which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to provide certain content or use certain technologies in the future 
many parties are actively developing search  indexing  e commerce and other web related technologies  as well as a variety of online business models and methods 
we believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies  including  but not limited to  seeking patent protection 
as a result  disputes regarding the ownership of these technologies and rights associated with online business are likely to arise in the future 
in addition to existing patents and intellectual property rights  we anticipate that additional third party patents related to our services will be issued in the future 
from time to time  parties assert patent infringement claims against us in the form of cease and desist letters  lawsuits and other communications 
if there is a determination that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others  we could incur substantial monetary liability  be forced to stop selling infringing products or providing infringing services  be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements  if available  or be prevented from using the rights  which could force us to change our business practices in the future 
as a result  these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we issue options under our stock option plans  which dilute the interest of stockholders 
we have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance under our long term incentive plan the ltip and our broad based incentive plan 
as approved by our stockholders  our ltip provides that additional shares of common stock may be reserved for issuance based on a formula contained in that plan 
the formula provides that the total number of shares of common stock remaining for grant under the ltip and any of our other option plans  plus the number of shares subject to unexercised options granted under any stock plan  shall not exceed of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of calculation of the additional shares 
therefore  we reserve additional shares on an ongoing basis for issuance under this plan 
at december   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of common stock with a

based on the ltip formula  we had  shares of common stock available for grant at december  additionally  we have reserved of the outstanding shares of common stock of our subsidiary  direct alliance corporation  under the direct alliance long term incentive plan 
at december   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of common stock of direct alliance corporation at a weighted average exercise price of 
when stock options with an exercise price lower than the current market price are exercised  the risk increases that our stockholders will experience dilution of earnings per share due to the increased number of shares outstanding 
also  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain equity capital may be affected  because the holders of outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in outstanding options 
our stock price has experienced volatility 
the price for our common stock has experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors  including quarterly increases or decreases in net sales  gross profit or earnings  and changes in our business  operations or prospects of any of our segments  announcements by us  our competitors or our vendors  changes in net sales or earnings estimates by the investment community  and general economic conditions 
the stock market has also experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have affected the market price of many companies and which  at times  have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
broad market fluctuations  developments in the it industry  general economic conditions and political and current events may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if our current security holders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon acquisitions or exercise of outstanding options  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholders rights agreement  as well as provisions of delaware law and executive employment contracts  could impair a takeover attempt 
we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which could have the effect separately  or in combination of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
these include provisions authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to our common stock  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings  requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors  controlling the procedures for conduct of board and stockholder meetings and election and removal of directors  and specifying that stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders 
these provisions  alone or together  could deter or delay hostile takeovers  proxy contests and changes in control or management 
as a delaware corporation  we are also subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
on december   each stockholder of record received one preferred share purchase right right on each outstanding share of common stock owned 
each right entitles stockholders to buy 
of a share of our series a preferred stock at an exercise price of 
the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of the common stock 
should this occur  the right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s exercise price  a number of shares of common stock having a market value at the time of twice the right s exercise price 
rights held by the holder will become void and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person acquires or more of the our common stock  each right will entitle its holder to purchase at the right s then current exercise price a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value at the time of twice the right s exercise price

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued additionally  we have employment agreements with certain officers and management employees under which severance payments would become payable under certain circumstances after a change in control 
if all such persons were terminated  and the severance payments under the current employment agreements were to become payable  the maximum contingent obligation calculated as of december  would be approximately million 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws or employment agreements  or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
sales of additional common stock and securities convertible into our common stock may dilute the voting power of current holders 
we may issue equity securities in the future whose terms and rights are superior to those of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
these are blank check preferred shares  meaning our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue the shares from time to time without stockholder consent 
no preferred shares are outstanding  and we currently do not intend to issue any shares of preferred stock in the foreseeable future 
any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future could be given voting and conversion rights that could dilute the voting power and equity of existing holders of shares of common stock and have preferences over shares of common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage interest rate exposure by maintaining a conservative debt to equity ratio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material 
our financing facilities expose net earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the interest bearing financing facilities totaled million at december  and the interest rate attributable to this outstanding balance was per annum at december  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign currency translation exposure arising from the operation of our foreign subsidiaries in canada and in the uk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to manage this exposure 
there were no hedging transactions during the year ended december  or hedging instruments outstanding at december
