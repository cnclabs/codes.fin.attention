the errors did not affect the results of operations or the cash flows reported for or the restatement had no effect on the company s compliance with bank covenants 
overview the world economy continued to improve  which helped the company generate net earnings in all four quarters of net sales in increased by over net sales in and all three of the company s business segments experienced an increase in net orders and net sales in orders for highly engineered construction projects had the largest improvement in all three segments 
the demand for oilgear hydraulic pumps is continuing to grow and our marketing efforts added new customers in we continue to invest in new products and product enhancements with emphasis on reducing operating costs to keep the company competitive in our industry 
discussion of results of operations net orders percentage increase decrease net sales shipments percentage increase vs 
the economic recovery that started late in continued throughout with orders for increasing by from the domestic segment s orders increased in by from although the increase in orders encompassed most of the products in the domestic segment  engineered 
table of contents construction projects  piston pumps and flow meters had the strongest recovery 
the economy influenced most of the change but the increase in spending for defense by the united states government caused an increase in orders from the us military for flow meters produced at our milwaukee plant 
in the european segment  orders in compared to increased by 
some of the increase came from a weaker dollar against the euro and pound sterling 
the to change in the euro and british pound average exchange rate relative to the us dollar were increases of approximately and  respectively 
most of the exchange related increase came from orders received by our subsidiary in leeds  england for hydraulic equipment used in weapons handling systems for submarines and in our italian subsidiary for projects using specialty fluids in the steel industry 
an increase in orders from customers in latin america provided most of the increase of orders in the international segment when compared to consolidated order levels were stronger in compared to for engineered products used in aerospace  forging and aluminum extrusion 
the increase in orders described above caused net sales in to increase by over  but the increase drops to an increase after adjusting for the effect of converting the foreign currencies to us dollars 
net sales for in the domestic segment increased by over the increase in piston pump sales was the primary reason for the overall increase while shipments of engineered construction projects have lagged behind because of longer lead time to complete 
the european segment net sales for increased by over but the increase drops to a after adjusting for the increase from converting the euro and british pound sterling to us dollars 
the international segment net sales for increased by but the increase drops to a after adjusting for the effect of converting the foreign currencies to us dollars 
the increase in the european and international segments came from contracts for highly engineered construction projects in the forging and extrusion industries 
vs 
although the domestic economy started to recover in  the fluid power industry lagged in that recovery 
our net orders in decreased by when compared to in our european segment received a large order for approximately  to supply equipment on a new forging press being installed in central france 
this single order distorts the comparisons of orders between the periods being reported 
excluding this individual order from the total  net orders for would have increased by when compared to approximately of the net orders were sold by our european segment and therefore were subject to translation from euros and british pounds  which further distorts the year to year comparison as the euro and british pound average exchange rate increased from their average by approximately and  respectively 
when orders in each geographic segment are compared to  the domestic segment increased by approximately  the european segment decreased by approximately and the international segment increased by approximately 
the increase in the domestic segment resulted from an increase in custom engineered orders for integrated hydraulic and electrical products used on extrusion presses and products used on the atlas v rocket program in the aerospace industry 
the large order discussed above was the primary reason for the decrease in european orders in if that order is taken out of the calculation  european segment orders increased by approximately in orders for integrated hydraulic and electrical products used in aluminum extrusion and forging applications were the reason for the increase in orders in the international segment 
net sales in increased by when compared to when comparing net sales to by segment  the domestic segment increased by  the european segment increased by and the international segment decreased by 
excluding the effect of favorable foreign exchange rates on sales  net sales for increased by over the economic condition in the fluid power industry was the primary reason net sales  measured in local currencies  remained relatively flat in roughly 
table of contents of the approximately  forging press order entered in was recognized through net sales in backlog backlog at december percentage increase decrease the increase in orders discussed above was the primary reason backlog increased by approximately  or at december  compared to the same date in approximately of the forging press order in france or approximately  converted at currency exchange rates at the end of remained in the backlog 
all the remaining equipment on this order is scheduled to be shipped in and the forging press is to be started up in the year end backlog decreased by  or  from the year end of approximately of the forging press order in france or approximately  converted at currency exchange rates at the end of remained in the backlog 
gross profit gross profit percentage increase decrease gross profit margin percentage increase decrease gross profit increased million  or in when compared to in addition  gross profit margin continued to increase in  up from in to in  despite rising material prices  health care costs  pension costs and intense price competition in our industry 
the increase in net sales which contributed to coverage of fixed manufacturing costs and improved profit was the primary reason for the increase in margin 
gross profit increased million or in when compared to gross profit margin also increased in from to despite the approximately  of added costs incurred from a manufacturing quality problem at our fremont plant 
by the end of  that quality problem was substantially alleviated 
the cost savings from closing plants  outsourcing to low cost vendors  a favorable union contract  the use of lean manufacturing techniques and a more favorable mix of products with higher profit margins all helped to improve the gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses less research and development selling  general and administrative less research and development percentage increase decrease percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses  less research and development  decreased by or approximately  in if the part of these expenses that were incurred in foreign currencies were 
table of contents converted using the average exchange rate instead of the average exchange rate  the expenses would have been approximately  or lower 
selling  general and administrative expenses  less research and development  increased by or  in when the local foreign currency expenses were converted to us dollars using the average exchange rate the expenses were approximately  higher than the expenses would have been if they were converted using the average exchange rate 
this was the primary reason for the increase in another factor that increased these expenses in was the approximately  increase in pension costs allocated to selling  general and administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an approximately  reduction in charges related to various headcount reductions and other exit costs recorded in and the company s and research and development expenses totaled approximately  in each year 
these expenses were  in the company continues its commitment to the design and manufacture of new and more efficient hydraulic products to gain new customers and to develop new applications for the company s products 
operating income operating income in of  compared to a  operating loss in and a  operating loss in the improved performance in was the result of increased net sales with higher gross profit margins and a small decrease in operating expenses 
the improved performance in when compared to was the result of increased net sales with higher gross profit margins 
interest expense interest expense increased by approximately  in and  in as the result of increased interest rates 
income tax income tax effective rates were  and in  and  respectively 
in recent years  the company has recorded income tax expense on losses before income taxes and minority interest due to significant losses in the domestic segment that are not benefited for tax purposes  coupled with earnings and related income tax expense in the european and international segments 
in  the reserve for income tax exposure items was reduced by approximately  to an amount supported by the risk associated with the possible tax liability  which is the primary reason for the negative effective tax rate 
changes in the valuation allowance were the principal reason for the fluctuation in effective tax rate in also see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional reconciliation of the tax rates 
net earnings net earnings of  for compared to a  loss in was the result of generating operating income in versus operating losses in the net loss of  for was primarily the result of approximately  of costs related to the quality problems in our fremont factory  approximately  of charges relating to inventory  receivables and fixed assets written off in our international segment and  of employee termination and other exit costs 
outlook although the overall growth rates that are reflected in the fluid power index data are starting to slow down from the very rapid growth of  the outlook is still positive according to most forecasts 
our net orders in the first two months of increased by approximately compared to the first two months of  and our backlog at february  is at a record level of approximately  an 
table of contents increase of  or since december  the continued weak value of the us dollar should continue to have a positive effect on net sales and gross margins in the european and international segments 
we are continuing to manage costs during this economic expansion as we did in the prior recession years 
however  increasing costs for legal  auditing and other sarbanes oxley compliance related costs will erode earnings potential 
as part of our cost reduction and efficiency improvement efforts  we are in the process of downsizing our facility in leeds  england and we expect to sign a lease to move these operations to a more efficient facility in we have entered into a conditional contract with a developer to sell our existing facility for  british pound sterling 
all conditions in the contract have been met except for us moving to a new location 
the property has close to a zero book value so the transaction will provide a significant gain in as of february  the property is encumbered by a  british pound sterling mortgage with barclays bank

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a more complete description of our accounting policies is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes that critical accounting policies include accounting for percentage of completion contracts  accounting for allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for pensions  accounting for inventory obsolescence and accounting for income taxes 
accounting for contracts using percentage of completion requires estimates of costs to complete each contract 
revenue earned is recorded based on accumulated incurred costs to total estimated costs to perform each contract 
management reviews these estimated costs on a monthly basis and revises costs and income recognized when changes in estimates occur 
to the extent the estimate of costs to complete varies  so does the timing of recording profits or losses on contracts 
management is required to make judgments  based on historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these 
table of contents allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule  and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
our accounting for pension benefits is primarily affected by our assumptions about the discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the equity markets and or long term interest rates decline  as was experienced in and  our pension liability and cash funding requirements will increase  ultimately increasing future pension expense 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in progress or finished goods 
inventory reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management uses estimates to record these reserves 
slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for certain deferred tax assets  principally related to certain domestic and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
interpretation r replaces interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company is required to apply interpretation r to interests in variable interest entities vie created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under interpretation r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date interpretation r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
the adoption of interpretation r did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes apb no 
and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee 
table of contents stock purchase plans 
the company is required to implement the proposed standard no later than july  the cumulative effect of adoption  applied on a modified prospective basis  would be measured and recognized on july  the company is currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions related to its stock compensation plans

in december   the fasb issued fasb staff position accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  in response to the american jobs creation act of which was signed into law in october  and which provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated as defined 
based on the company s decision to reinvest rather than to repatriate current and prior year s unremitted foreign earnings  the application of fsp did not affect income tax expense or related disclosures in the period and is not expected to impact the measurement of income tax expense in future periods 
in november   the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board iasb toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
the fasb and the iasb noted that arb  chapter and ias  inventories  require that abnormal amounts of idle freight  handling costs  and wasted materials be recognized as period costs  however  the boards noted that differences in the wording of the two standards could lead to inconsistent application of those similar requirements 
the fasb concluded that clarifying the existing requirements in arb by adopting language similar to that used in ias is consistent with its goals of improving financial reporting in the united states and promoting convergence of accounting standards internationally 
adoption of sfas is required for fiscal years beginning after june  the provisions of sfas will be applied prospectively and are not expected to have a material impact on results of operations and financial position of the company
