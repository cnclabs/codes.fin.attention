during  the portland mill was the beneficiary of a committed power supply contract with a local utility company 
under the contract the utility guaranteed to supply an amount of electricity to the mill at a fixed rate 
during the west coast electricity shortage in and  the company agreed not to use a daily determined portion of the guaranteed supply and was compensated by the local utility at a daily determined rate per megawatt hour 
the revenue from this was included in operating income because the company made an operational choice to not use power in return for compensation rather than to produce product 
there was no direct cost of sales associated with this transaction and  accordingly  the net revenue compensation in excess of contracted price fully impacted operating income for the period

overview the consolidated financial statements include all wholly owned and those majority owned subsidiaries over which the company exerts management control 
non controlled subsidiaries and affiliates are accounted for using the equity method 
material wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries of the company are wholly owned camrose pipe corporation cpc  which does business as columbia structural tubing and which  through ownership in another corporation  holds a percent interest in camrose pipe company camrose  which owns the camrose pipe mill  a percent interest in ofp  and percent owned new cf i which owns a percent interest in cf i 
the company also directly owns an additional percent interest in cf i 
in january  cf i assumed the trade name rocky mountain steel mills rmsm 
new cf i owns a percent interest in the colorado and wyoming railway company 
all significant inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the company currently has two aggregated operating divisions known as the oregon steel division and the rmsm division 
the oregon steel division is centered at the steel plate mill in portland  oregon  which in addition to sales to third parties  supplies steel plate and coiled plate to the company s structural tubing and welded pipe finishing facilities 
the oregon steel division s steel pipe mill in napa  california is a large diameter steel line pipe mill and fabrication facility 
in july  the company idled the napa pipe mill  and in december  the company announced the permanent closure of the napa pipe mill and has contracted with third parties to market the pipe mill equipment and real estate 
the oregon steel division also produces large diameter line pipe and erw line pipe and casing at the camrose pipe mill 
in october  the oregon steel division began production of structural tubing at its cst facility 
the company intends to construct a new spiral weld dsaw pipe mill and plans to begin production in the first quarter of the rmsm division consists of the steelmaking and finishing facilities of the pueblo mill  as well as certain related operations 
on january   the company announced a tentative agreement to settle the labor dispute between the union and cf i and  on september   the settlement was finalized and became effective 
the company recorded charges of million and million related to the settlement in and  respectively

in may  the company shut down its portland mill melt shop 
the determination to close the melt shop was based on the company s ability to obtain steel slab through purchases from suppliers on the open market  and the high energy and raw material costs and the yield losses associated with the inefficient casting technology in use at the portland mill 
the company forecasts that future steel slab purchases for the portland mill will meet the production needs of the portland mill finishing operation for and into the foreseeable future 
the company intends to maintain the melt shop in operating condition but is also exploring other alternatives and has contracted with a third party to market the melt shop equipment to suitable buyers 
associated with the operations of the melt shop is an oxygen purchase contract which cannot be used in current operations and therefore does not provide a current benefit to the company unless it decides to restart the melt shop 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  asset impairments 
in the future if the company determines to not reopen the melt shop  or terminates the associated oxygen purchase contract  the company will incur an expense for contract termination costs 
the company estimates the cancellation and buyout costs could range from million to million  depending on negotiation of a settlement 
none of the future costs of the contract have been accrued as of december   in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities as the company has not effectively ceased its rights under the contract 
in addition  cf i determined in the second quarter of that the new single furnace operation will not have the capacity to support a two caster operation and therefore cf i has determined that one caster and other related assets have no future service potential 
the company recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million in the second quarter of related to the melt shop and caster and other related asset impairments

on december   president bush lifted the tariffs on imports of steel that were imposed march  the tariffs were designed to give the united states steel industry time to restructure and become competitive in the global steel market 
during the time that the tariffs were in effect  the company believes that the tariffs did not materially impact either the supply of  or the cost of  steel slabs purchased by the company on the open market for processing into steel plate and coil 
since the lifting of the tariffs  the steel industry has seen a dramatic increase in both the cost of raw materials and the selling price of most steel products 
the company believes that current market conditions are the result of the combination of a strong steel demand in asia  a weak united states dollar  and an increase in ocean freight costs 
the company anticipates that market conditions will remain unsettled into the foreseeable future 
during this period of time  the company believes that it will continue to incur increased costs for steel scrap  steel slabs  and ocean freight 
the company s operating results were positively affected in by  among other things  increased overall demand for steel products and higher average selling prices for plate  coil  erw pipe  rail and rod and bar products 
operating income was negatively impacted by higher raw materials costs  higher incentive compensation expenses resulting from improved profitability as well as the charge for the settlement of the labor dispute noted above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this provides a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
employee benefits plans and other post retirement benefits 
annual pension and other post retirement benefits oprb expenses are calculated by third party actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies 
the actuaries assist the company in making estimates based on both historical and current information and estimates about future events and circumstances 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of pension and oprb include expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels 
the company accounts for the defined benefit pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions and its post retirement medical plan under fas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the company s other comprehensive income balance related to minimum pension liability decreased by  after tax effect in for further details regarding the company s benefits and post retirement plans  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental liabilities 
all material environmental remediation liabilities for non capital expenditures  which are both probable and estimable  are recorded in the financial statements based on current technologies and current environmental standards at the time of evaluation 
adjustments are made when additional information is available that suggests different remediation methods or when estimated time periods are changed  thereby affecting the total cost 
the best estimate of the probable cost within a range is recorded  however  if there is no best estimate  the low end of the range is recorded and the range is disclosed 
even though the company has established certain reserves for environmental remediation  environmental authorities may require additional remedial measures and additional environmental hazards  necessitating further remedial expenditures  may be asserted by these authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts reserved 
deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
as of december   the allowance of doubtful accounts was approximately million 
in establishing a proper allowance for doubtful accounts  the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where management is aware of the circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific allowance against amounts due from customers  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  historical collection experience  customer credit worthiness and economic trends 
long lived asset impairments 
asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of assets held for use exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows and the estimated fair value of the assets are less than the carrying value 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on the company s long range estimates of market conditions and the overall performance associated with the individual asset groups 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by the company  asset write downs may be required 
impairments of assets held for sale are recognized when the carrying value of the assets are in excess of their estimated fair value 
contingencies 
the company is subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
the company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies

the increase in consolidated tonnage shipments in is primarily due to increased shipments of plate and coil  erw pipe  structural tubing  and rail products partially offset by lower large diameter steel line pipe  rod and bar and seamless pipe shipments 
the increase in sales and average sales price were primarily due to higher average selling prices for plate  coil  large diameter steel line pipe  erw pipe  rail and rod and bar products and the increased shipments noted above 
increased shipments and selling prices are the result of a combination of factors including strong steel demand in asia  a weak united states dollar and increased ocean freight costs  all of which made the united states market less attractive to foreign producers in gross profit change change gross profit the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily a result of higher average sales prices  and to a lesser extent  the increased sales volume  partially offset by higher steel slab and scrap costs and the inability to fully recover the increased cost of raw material for rail  large diameter line pipe and erw pipe products 
the cost of steel slab and scrap increased by and  respectively  in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses change change selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily the result of a million charge due to the ten year profit participation obligation resulting from the labor dispute settlement between the union and cf i

income tax expense benefit change change income tax expense benefit the effective income tax expense rate was in as compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in the effective income tax rate for varied from the combined state and federal statutory rate principally because the company reversed a portion of the valuation allowance  established in  for certain federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  state tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that tax benefits for federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  state tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits each be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  the company reduced its valuation allowance in by million because earnings reduced the uncertainty of realization identified in the company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances in the future 
changes in estimated future taxable income and other underlying factors may lead to adjustments to the valuation allowances 
as of december  the only significant valuation allowance relates to the state of colorado net operating loses and credits

the decrease in consolidated sales and average sales price was primarily due to a reduction in large diameter line pipe sales at the oregon steel division 
during  the oregon steel division sales were higher due to a large pipe contract for the kern river gas transmission company at the napa pipe mill 
no similar large pipe contract was in place in and consequently the oregon steel division s sales  shipments  and sales price per ton were significantly reduced 
the rmsm division s sales  shipments and sales price per ton all increased in due to higher shipments of rod and bar products as a result of higher rod production and a reduction in domestic capacity 
gross profits change change gross profit the decrease in gross profit was a result of the decreased sales of high priced large diameter line pipe from the napa pipe mill  and to an increase in the company s costs due to increased costs in steel scrap  steel slab  and energy costs for electricity and natural gas 
selling  general and administrative change change selling  general and administrative the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for was the result of a decrease of million in expenses related to the handling and loading of goods for sale  which was due to a decrease in the volume of tons shipped in  a decrease of million in expenses for information technology support and equipment  and a decrease of million in bad debt expense 
interest expense change change interest expense the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decreased borrowing rate during the company issued its first mortgage notes due notes on july  in order to refinance its first mortgage notes due notes 
the company also incurred additional interest expense in due to interest accrued on the notes which were outstanding concurrently with the notes for the period of july to august  income tax benefit expense change change income tax benefit expense the effective income tax benefit rate was in  compared to the tax expense rate of in the effective income tax rate for varied from the combined state and federal statutory rate principally because the company established a valuation allowance for certain federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  state tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits

 accounting for income taxes  requires that tax benefits for federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  state tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million in due to uncertainties regarding the realization of these deferred tax assets 
impairment charges in may  the company shut down its portland mill melt shop 
the determination to close the melt shop was based on the company s ability to obtain steel slab through purchases from suppliers on the open market and the high energy and raw material costs and the yield losses associated with the inefficient casting technology in use at the portland mill 
the company continues to maintain the melt shop in operating condition but is also exploring other alternatives and has contracted with a third party to market the melt shop equipment to suitable buyers 
in connection with the melt shop closure  the company has determined the value of the related assets to be impaired 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge to earnings of million for the melt shop and other related assets 
of this impairment charge recognized  million represented impairment of fixed assets and million pertained to reduction of dedicated stores and operating supplies to net realizable value 
following the impairment charge  the carrying value of the fixed assets was approximately million 
the fair value of the impaired fixed assets was determined using the company s estimate of market prices for similar assets 
associated with the operations of the melt shop is an oxygen purchase contract which cannot be used in current operations and therefore does not provide a current benefit to the company unless the company decides to restart the melt shop 
in the future  if the company determines the melt shop will not reopen  or decides to terminate the associated oxygen purchase contract  it will incur an expense for contract termination costs 
the company estimates the cancellation and buyout costs could range from million to million  depending on negotiation of a settlement 
none of the future costs of the contract have been accrued as of december   in accordance with sfas no

see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  asset impairments 
as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  contingencies  part of the settlement with the cdphe and the epa requires cf i to install one new electric arc furnace  and thus the two existing furnaces with a combined melting and casting capacity of approximately million tons through two continuous casters will be shut down 
cf i has determined that the new single furnace operation will not have the capacity to support a two caster operation and therefore cf i has determined that one caster and other related assets have no future service potential 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge to earnings of million 
of this impairment charge recognized  million represented impairment of fixed assets and million pertained to reduction of related stores items to net realizable value 
because it is believed the caster has no salvage value following the impairment charge  the carrying value of the fixed assets was zero after the effect of the impairment charge

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally short term debt 
the following discussion of market risks necessarily includes forward looking statements 
actual changes in market conditions and rates and fair values may differ materially from those used in the sensitivity and fair value calculations discussed 
factors which may cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to greater than changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  changes in income or cash flows requiring significant changes in the use of debt instruments or the cash flows associated with them  or changes in commodity market conditions affecting availability of materials in ways not predicted by the company 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis was used to determine the potential impact that market risk exposure may have on the fair values of the company s financial instruments  including debt  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company has assessed the potential risk of loss in fair values from hypothetical changes in interest rates by determining the effect on the present value of the future cash flows related to these market sensitive instruments 
the discount rates used for these present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at december   plus or minus 
all of the company s debt is fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt by million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt by million 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current yield 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because the company intends to hold these obligations to maturity unless the company elects to repurchase its outstanding debt securities at prevailing market prices 
the company invests available cash in high quality investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
the value of the company s investment securities may decline in the event of increases in market interest rates however  the company manages this risk by investing in cash equivalents that have maturities of days or less with varying maturity dates and short term investments that offer near term re pricing features 
foreign currency risk in general  the company uses a single functional currency for all receipts  payments and other settlements at its facilities 
occasionally  transactions will be denominated in another currency and a foreign currency forward exchange contract is used to hedge currency gains and losses  however  at december   the company did not have any open forward contracts
