item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview solid demand for our new products for image guided radiation therapy  or igrt  and stereotactic treatments and service contracts  together with a focus on execution and operational efficiency  enabled us to achieve excellent financial results in fiscal year both of our business segments and the other category contributed positively to the growth in annual net orders  revenues and operating margins 
with the help of our gross margin improvements  our operating earnings for fiscal year increased by from fiscal year during fiscal year  we generated a record million of cash flows from operations 
we delivered a return on equity  an increase of percentage points from a return on equity in fiscal year oncology systems 
our largest business segment is oncology systems  which produces  sells and services hardware and software products for treating cancer with radiation  including linear accelerators  treatment simulation and verification products  information management and treatment planning software and other sophisticated accessory products and services 
our products enable radiation oncology departments in hospitals and clinics to perform conventional radiotherapy treatments and offer the advanced treatment processes of intensity modulated radiation therapy  or imrt  and igrt 
in our view  the fundamental market drivers for long term growth in the radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery markets continue to be the rising cancer incidence  underserved medical needs outside of the united states  technology advances that are leading to improvements in patient care  improvement in cost efficiency in delivering radiation therapy and customer demand for more advanced and effective treatments such as imrt  igrt and stereotactic radiosurgery 
our focus in the oncology systems business segment is on advancing igrt and imrt technology and treatments 
adoption of our new igrt technology was strong in fiscal year  with an increasing percentage of orders for our high energy clinac accelerators including our on board imager  or obi  and also our portalvision accessory 
as of the end of fiscal year  more than installations of our obi for our high energy clinac accelerators and trilogy medical linear accelerators were either complete or in progress 
for fiscal year  north american net orders rose while international net orders grew by 
we also have seen a continued shift in our oncology systems business from north america to the international regions  with international net orders accounting for of the total oncology systems net orders in fiscal year  compared to of the total oncology systems net orders in fiscal year we believe that the lower growth rate in north american oncology systems net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to the continued slowdown in demand in north america for radiotherapy capital equipment  particularly equipment for imrt 
this slowdown came after several years of strong growth driven by rapid adoption of imrt and as imrt has become more of an established treatment methodology 
conversely  starting about three years ago  international regions entered a rapid adoption phase for imrt technology and demand for radiation therapy equipment in international regions strongly increased after several years of slow growth 
this appears to be consistent with a historical pattern where the international regions and north american region have different cycles of demand and technology adoption  with one growing rapidly while the other is in a relatively slow growth phase 
also  last year and earlier this year  after the introduction of our new products for igrt  we noted some confusion about igrt technology in the radiotherapy community and longer decision making time periods as customers evaluated igrt  all of which we believe contributed to the overall slowdown in the north american region 
we believe now that hospitals and clinics are beginning to have a better understanding of igrt and its potential for improving the outcomes and cost effectiveness of cancer care 
similar to what we have experienced with imrt  we expect that igrt will become one of the main contributors to net orders and revenues growth in our oncology systems business segment in the coming years  with north america ahead of international regions in adoption rate 
our success in oncology systems largely depends upon our ability to retain leadership in technological innovation  the cost effectiveness of our products  the efficacy of our treatment technology and external economic influences 
factors affecting the adoption rate of new technologies such as igrt could include our internal efficiency in design  documentation and testing  deployment and installation and the more widely demonstrated efficacy of igrt by early adopters 
they may also include customer training  reimbursement and our ability to educate customers about the cost effectiveness of our new technology and clinical outcome advantages 
external economic influences could include hospital financial strength in the united states  foreign currency exchange rates and governmental healthcare policies outside the united states 
x ray products 
our second business segment is x ray products  which manufactures and sells i x ray tubes for use in a range of applications including computed tomography  or ct  scanning  radioscopic fluoroscopic imaging  mammography  special procedures and industrial applications and ii flat panel imaging products also commonly referred to as flat panel detectors for digital x ray image capture  which is an alternative to image intensifier tubes for fluoroscopy and x ray film for radiography 
we continue to view the fundamental growth driver for this component business to be the on going success of key original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that incorporate our x ray tube products and flat panel detectors into their medical diagnostic and industrial imaging systems 
our flat panel detectors are being incorporated into next generation imaging equipment  including equipment for igrt such as obi  and for dental ct scanning and veterinary x ray imaging 
x ray products had an extremely good year in net orders  revenues and operating earnings growth in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to significant growth in net orders  revenues and operating earnings of flat panel detectors 
other 
the operations of the ginzton technology center  or gtc  and brachytherapy are reported as part of the other category of our segment information see note  segment information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form k 
in fiscal year  we continued to invest in developing technologies that enhance our current businesses or may lead to new business areas  including next generation digital x ray imaging technology  volumetric and functional imaging  improved x ray sources and technology for security and cargo screening applications 
in addition  we are developing technologies and products that promise to improve disease management by more precise targeting of radiation  as well as by employing targeted energy and molecular agents to enhance the effectiveness and broaden the application of radiation therapy 
gtc is also investigating the use of x ray and high energy accelerator technology for security applications 
our brachytherapy operations manufacture  sell and service advanced brachytherapy products  which include treatment planning software  afterloaders and applicators 
our brachytherapy products are being used for partial breast irradiation and many other applications 
in fiscal year  we experienced significant revenue growth of brachtherapy products primarily attributable to increased sales of our high dose afterloader  or hdr product 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the information contained under factors affecting our business in item we discuss our results of operations below 
all figures given in this annual report on form k are based on actual reported results 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  also see factors affecting our business in item revenue recognition we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with gaap 
in addition  the amount of product revenues recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for hardware products and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value for software products in arrangements with multiple elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value or vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment of a small portion upon signing of the purchase order contract  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions may be needed and our future operating results could be negatively impacted 
inventories our inventories include high technology parts and components that may be specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the majority of companies we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price has been typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill if indicators of potential impairment exist 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should conditions be different from management s current estimates  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal years or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
in fiscal years and  we performed such evaluations and found no impairment 
warranty obligations we warrant our products for a specific period of time  usually one year  against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively impact our operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remediation efforts are probable and the costs of these assessments or remediation efforts can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  and the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
the accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate as to the total costs of remediation and the time period over which these costs will be incurred 
on a quarterly basis  we review these accrued balances 
if we were required to accrue additional environmental remediation costs in the future  it would negatively impact our operating results 
defined benefit and post retirement benefit plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans covering the employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost increases  which we determined within certain guidelines 
in addition  we also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the expense and liability 
the actuarial assumptions we use are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we recorded 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries other than germany are based on high quality aa rated corporate bonds with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations 
the discount rate for the defined benefit plan in germany was determined using fixed income german government investments corresponding to the duration of the benefit obligations adjusted to take into account the difference between the yield curve on high quality corporate fixed income investments and government fixed income investment 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
taxes on earnings we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest may be due 
these liabilities are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the provision for taxes on earnings includes the effect of changes to these liabilities that are considered appropriate 
in addition  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings to fully utilize these deferred tax assets 
should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination 
earnings derived from our international regions are generally taxed at rates lower than us rates 
the ability to maintain our current effective rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international regions  or a change in the mix of international regions among particular tax jurisdictions  could increase our effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday nearest september fiscal year comprised the week period ended on september  fiscal year was the week period ended on october  and fiscal year was the week period ended on september  on june   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
the distribution of the shares was made on july  to stockholders of record as of june  unless otherwise stated  all references to the number of shares and per share amounts of our common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the increased number of shares resulting from the two for one split 
discussion of financial data for fiscal years ended  and total revenues revenues by sales classification fiscal years dollars in millions change change product service contracts and other total revenues product as a percentage of total revenues service contracts and other as a percentage of total revenues revenues by region north america europe asia rest of world total international total north america as a percentage of total revenues international as a percentage of total revenues we consider international revenues to be revenues outside of north america 
total revenues increased in fiscal year over fiscal year and fiscal year over fiscal year due primarily to the increases in oncology systems revenues in each of those years  although x ray products business segment and other category also contributed to the increases 
however  total revenue growth in fiscal year from fiscal year was less than the growth both in absolute dollars and percentage growth in fiscal year from fiscal year  principally due to the slowdown in product revenue growth in oncology systems 
this slowdown was offset in part by strong x ray products revenue growth which contributed appreciably more revenue growth in fiscal year than in fiscal year increased service contracts and other revenues also contributed to the increase in total revenues  with the amount of the service contracts and other revenues increasing in fiscal year greater than in fiscal year though lesser on a percentage of total revenues basis due to the higher total revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 
oncology systems service contracts revenues continued to comprise the vast bulk of total service contracts and other revenues  as well as being the primary contributor to the increase in total service and other revenues  in each of fiscal years and oncology systems also was the primary contributor to the increases in international revenues in fiscal years and the shift in international revenues and service contracts revenues as a greater percentage of total revenues is reflective of similar shifts in the oncology systems business segment  with international oncology systems revenues and service contracts revenues becoming a greater percentage of oncology systems revenues over the same time period 
oncology systems revenues revenues by sales classification fiscal years dollars in millions change change product service contracts total oncology systems product as a percentage of oncology systems revenues service contracts as a percentage of oncology systems revenues oncology systems revenues as a percentage of total revenues the majority of the growth in total revenues for oncology systems business segment in fiscal year over fiscal year came from increased product revenues 
however  total oncology systems revenues grew appreciably less in fiscal year over fiscal year than in fiscal year over fiscal year due primarily to the continued slowdown in the product revenue growth of oncology systems in north america as discussed in the overview section of this md a 
the increase from oncology systems product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of our new accessory products that enable igrt  including our obi and portalvision products  which was stronger in the second half of the fiscal year 
in addition  higher sales volume of our core products  including the trilogy accelerators  contributed to a significant portion of oncology systems product revenues growth 
service contracts revenues grew faster than product revenues for fiscal years and service contracts revenues increased in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to the increase in sophistication of our products and the success of our software products which generate annual maintenance contracts and renewals 
oncology systems product revenues increased in fiscal years from fiscal year due to the demand for and rapid adoption rate of our imrt related products 
additionally  the relatively weak us dollar made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors in the international regions 
the increase in service contracts revenues for fiscal year over fiscal year was due to a combination of factors  including growth in the installed base of our products and the increase in sophistication of our products particularly software products which generate maintenance contracts 
the acquisition of the radiotherapy equipment service business of mitsubishi electric co 
in japan in fiscal year also contributed to the increase in service contracts revenues 
revenues by region fiscal years dollars in millions change change north america europe asia rest of world total international total oncology systems north america as a percentage of oncology systems revenues international as a percentage of oncology systems revenues although all of our geographic regions contributed to the increase in oncology systems revenues for fiscal years and  our revenues from north american oncology systems grew modestly at in fiscal year  compared with  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe that the rapid adoption rate of imrt was the primary driver for the strong revenue growth in the earlier periods 
similarly  as imrt has become more of an established treatment technology  we experienced the inevitable lower growth rate in the market for radiotherapy capital equipment  particularly equipment for imrt as discussed in the overview section of this md a 
on the other hand  international revenues continued its strong growth rates of  and in fiscal years  and  respectively  when compared with the respective prior fiscal years after a year of negative growth rate of in fiscal year over fiscal year strong demand internationally started about three years ago primarily driven by the underserved markets in the international regions and the increase in adoption rate of imrt by our international customers  similar to what we had seen in north america several years ago 
the growth in international revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year was also due in part to i increased service revenues from the radiotherapy equipment service business of mitsubishi electric co 
in japan  ii the acquisition of sigma micro informatique conseil  or sigma micro  in january that added to our european revenues  and to a lesser extent iii the continuing weakness of the us dollar for most of fiscal year that effectively made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors 
the growth in international revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year was due in part to factors such as i the relatively weak us dollar that effectively made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors and ii the acquisition of the radiotherapy equipment service business of mitsubishi electric co 
in japan in february the decrease in revenues growth rate for north america and the continuously strong revenue growth rate for our international regions are consistent with the orders growth patterns  and were due to the same factors  as discussed more fully in the net orders section of this md a 
x ray products revenues revenues by region fiscal years dollars in millions change change north america europe asia rest of world total international total x ray products as a percentage of total revenues x ray products revenues increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year exceeding our expectation of long term growth rates for the x ray products business segment in the to range 
all of our geographic regions contributed to the increase in x ray products revenues for fiscal years and the unusually strong growth in x ray products revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily driven by higher sales volume of our flat panel detectors in north america  as well as increased sales volume of our high power  anode grounded ct scanning tubes from primarily one oem customer 
the increase in x ray products revenues for fiscal year over fiscal year was attributable to the continuing demand by our largest oem customers for our high power  anode grounded ct scanning tube and to a lesser extent to increased revenues from our flat panel detectors with a second major oem beginning to purchase our flat panel detectors in the second half of fiscal year other revenues revenues by sales classification fiscal years dollars in millions change change product service contracts and other total other as a percentage of total revenues for our other category  which is comprised of gtc and our brachytherapy operations  the increase in revenues for fiscal year over fiscal year was driven exclusively by the brachytherapy business 
higher sales volume of hdr afterloaders for accelerated breast treatments in north america and europe was the primary driver for the growth in the brachytherapy business 
the increase in revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due almost exclusively to brachytherapy 
the increases in service contracts and other revenues for fiscal years and were due in part to the growth in the installed base of our brachytherapy products and increased sales of service maintenance contracts of brachytherapy treatment planning software 
gross margin fiscal years dollars in millions change change as adjusted as adjusted dollar by segment oncology systems x ray products other gross margin percentage by segment oncology systems x ray products total company both of our business segments and the other category contributed to the percentage point increase in total gross margin from fiscal years to  although the increase in total gross margins was primarily due to the increase in the oncology systems gross margin 
total gross margin of is the highest achieved annual gross margin since we became a standalone medical systems company in our total gross margin increased by percentage points from fiscal years to due primarily to a higher oncology systems gross margin offset partially by a lower x ray products gross margin 
total product gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
total service contracts and other gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
oncology systems gross margin continued to improve and increased percentage point from fiscal years to oncology systems product gross margin increased slightly to in fiscal year from in fiscal year due primarily to higher average selling price  lower product costs  lower warranty costs as a result of improved product engineering and design and partially offset by continuing shift to lower margin international revenues 
service contracts gross margin in oncology systems continued to show strong performance and increased significantly to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year due primarily to higher volumes and growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts in oncology systems 
the increase of percentage points in oncology systems gross margin for fiscal year from fiscal year resulted from severalfactors including higher sales volume yielding lower average product costs  improvements in service margins partly reflecting the growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts  product mix shift towards accessory and other products for imrt and higher amount of product acceptance revenues in fiscal year versus fiscal year  all of which more than offset the shift in geographic mix for sales towards international regions  which typically have lower margins 
x ray products gross margin in fiscal year increased slightly at percentage point from fiscal year due to significant gross margin gains from the increasing sales volume of our flat panel detectors  partially offset by higher raw material costs and manufacturing costs associated with new x ray tube types 
we believe that the flat panel detectors  which have significantly higher gross margin than that of x ray tube products  should contribute to higher total gross margin for this segment as the flat panel imaging business becomes a bigger part of the total x ray products business over time 
the decline in x ray products gross margin for fiscal year over fiscal year was due to a combination of increased warranty costs for an existing tube product that we sell exclusively to one oem and start up costs for a new tube product 
research and development fiscal years dollars in millions change change research and development as a percentage of total revenues our research and development expenses have remained in line with our revenue growth 
the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses for fiscal year was primarily driven by increased spending of million in oncology systems 
our research and development efforts in oncology systems in fiscal year have been focused on the development of next generation products and accessories  specifically our next generation linear accelerator  promising technologies for cancer care imaging  and other technologies such as our monte carlo and dose calculation algorithms for our treatment planning software products and our new electronic health records within our varis information management software  as well as software projects related to sigma micro 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the future 
the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in oncology systems for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable primarily to a increased employee headcount  materials costs and consulting expenses of million in total  b increased expenses of million related to the new projects from our recent acquisition of sigma micro  and c increased expenses of million resulting from the relatively weak us dollar for our foreign operations as the research and development expenses are translated into us dollars 
the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses for fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased spending of million in oncology systems 
the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable primarily to a increased employee headcount  materials costs and consulting expenses of million in total  b increased expenses of million related to the new projects from our recent acquisitions  and c increased expenses of million related to research grants 
selling  general and administrative fiscal years dollars in millions change change selling  general and administrative as a percentage of total revenues despite incurring approximately million to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  we reduced selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues by about one half percentage point to in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable primarily to a increased employee related expenses of million resulting from an increase in employee headcount in oncology systems  corporate headquarters and x ray products to support our growing business activities  b increased incremental expenses of million related to compliance with the required documentation and testing of internal control over financial reporting as mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of  c increased operating expenses of million related to acquisitions  d increased expenses of million related to our information systems and e increased expenses of million resulting from the relatively weak us dollar for our foreign operations as the selling  general and administrative expenses are translated into us dollars 
these increases were partially offset by i decreased employee related expenses of million for employee and management incentive plans  ii increased income on equity investment in dpix holding of million and iii decreased fees of million related to certain commission arrangements 
the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses  although lower as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable primarily to a increased employee related expenses of million resulting from an increase in employee headcount in oncology systems and corporate headquarters to support our growing business activities  b increased operating expenses of million related to our acquisitions of zmed  inc  the mitsubishi electric co 
radiotherapy equipment service business and the optx corporation business  and c increased expenses of million resulting from the relatively weak us dollar for our foreign operations as the selling  general and administrative expenses are translated into us dollars 
interest income  net fiscal years dollars in millions change change interest income  net the increase in interest income  net in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to increase in interest rates in fiscal year over fiscal year  partly offset by decreases in the levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities between fiscal years and the decline in interest income  net in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to a one time state income tax refund which contained an interest component of million that was received in fiscal year  as well as decreases in the levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest rates between the fiscal years and taxes on earnings fiscal years change change effective tax rate the decrease in effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a shift of earnings towards countries with lower statutory rates 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year was the same as in fiscal year in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rates largely as a function of benefits realized from foreign taxes  the extraterritorial income exclusion and research and development credit 
our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates 
earnings per diluted share fiscal years change change earnings per diluted share the increase in earnings per diluted share in fiscal year from fiscal year can be attributed to the increase in total revenues  improvements in gross margins  the reduction in effective tax rate and the reduction in outstanding shares of common stock due to stock repurchases 
the increase in earnings per diluted share in fiscal year from fiscal year can be attributed to the increase in total revenues  improvements in gross margins and slower growth in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues between the two fiscal years 
net orders total net orders by segment and region fiscal years dollars in millions change change oncology systems north america total international total oncology systems x ray products north america total international total x ray products other total net orders the increase in our total net orders for fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in oncology systems net orders 
while our north american oncology systems net orders grew modestly at in fiscal year over fiscal year  our international oncology systems net orders continued to show strong growth at in fiscal year over fiscal year we also have seen a continued shift in our oncology systems business from north america to the international regions  with international net orders accounting for of the total oncology systems net orders in fiscal year  compared to of the total oncology systems net orders in fiscal year we believe that the lower growth rate in north american oncology systems net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to the continued slowdown in demand in north america for radiotherapy capital equipment  particularly equipment for imrt 
this slowdown came after several years of strong growth driven by rapid adoption of imrt and as imrt has become more of an established treatment methodology 
conversely  starting about three years ago  international regions entered a rapid adoption phase for imrt technology and demand for radiation therapy equipment in international regions strongly increased after several years of slow growth 
this appears to be consistent with a historical pattern where the international regions and north american region have different cycles of demand and technology adoption  with one growing rapidly while the other is in a relatively slow growth phase 
also  last year and earlier this year  after the introduction of our new products for igrt  we noted some confusion about igrt technology in the radiotherapy community and longer decision making time periods as customers evaluated igrt  all of which we believe contributed to the overall slowdown in the north american region 
we believe now that hospitals and clinics are beginning to have a better understanding of igrt and its potential for improving the outcomes and cost effectiveness of cancer care 
similar to what we have experienced with imrt  we expect that igrt will become one of the main contributors to net orders and revenues growth in our oncology systems business segment in the coming years  with north america ahead of international regions in the timing of adoption 
we continue to believe that the oncology systems business segment can sustain global long term growth of to a year due to fundamental market factors for growth in the radiation therapy market that we believe have remained unchanged 
in any given period  however  orders growth in either north america or international regions  or both  could be outside of this range 
the actual timing of sales and revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders and the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products and are usually shorter for some types of orders  such as upgrades ie  the addition of new features or accessories to existing equipment 
thus  orders in any quarter or period are not necessarily directly correlated to the level of sales or revenues in any particular future quarter or period 
moreover  as the overall mix of net orders includes a greater proportion of software products and newly introduced oncology systems products  which typically have longer time from order to completion of installation  and a higher percentage of our overall oncology systems business coming from international regions  which typically have a longer period from shipment to revenue recognition  the average time period within which orders convert into sales could lengthen 
in fact  our oncology systems net orders and backlog grew substantially more than our revenues for fiscal years and and we estimate that the average time of orders in backlog has increased by about three months 
x ray products have relatively short turn around from net orders to shipments 
x ray products net orders increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to continuing strong demand for our high power  anode grounded ct scanning tubes and robust demand for our flat panel detectors 
after years of investment in flat panel technology  the flat panel product line is showing signs of becoming a significant contributor to our x ray products business segment 
as the flat panel imaging business becomes a more significant part of the total x ray products business over time and as the demand for ct scanning tubes continues to have solid growth  we expect the long term growth rates for x ray products business to increase by percentage points to the to range 
backlog at september   we had a backlog of billion  an increase of compared to october  our oncology systems backlog at september  increased by from october   including a increase for north america and a increase for international regions 
fiscal year outlook total revenues we expect that total revenues for fiscal year should increase by about over the total for fiscal year net earnings per diluted share for fiscal year  we anticipate that net earnings per diluted share should be in the range of to 
we expect that the annual impact of expensing stock options in fiscal year will be between and per diluted share 
excluding the impact of expensing stock options  growth in net earnings per diluted share should be in the range of to for fiscal year over the comparable fiscal year taxes on earnings for fiscal year  we estimate that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 
however  there may be variability in the quarterly tax rates should discrete items  such as settlement of a tax audit  arise 
our future effective tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of our pre tax earnings  research and development credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
net orders  backlog and fiscal year outlook contain forward looking statements and projections that are subject to the factors  risks and uncertainties set forth or referred to this md a and under factors affecting our business included in item actual results and the outcome or timing of certain events may differ significantly 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  acquire businesses and fund continuing operations 
our sources of cash include operations  stock option exercises and employee stock purchases  borrowings and interest income 
our cash usage is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities the following table summarizes our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in millions september  october  increase decrease as adjusted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal year was primarily a result of using cash and cash proceeds from maturities of marketable securities for the repurchase of common stock of million  capital expenditures of million  acquisition of business of million  contribution of million to the trust assets of our deferred compensation plan  which invests in corporate owned life insurance contracts  repayments on bank borrowings of million and advances of loans of million 
cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by the issuance of common stock of million related to stock option exercises and employee stock purchases significantly offset these uses 
at september   we had approximately million or of total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the united states 
on the other hand  approximately million or of total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated to the united states 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions in the american jobs creation act of  or the jobs creation act 
based on our analysis to date  however  it is reasonably possible that we may repatriate up to million  with the respective tax liability of up to million 
we currently expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by the second quarter of fiscal year cash flows fiscal years in millions as adjusted as adjusted net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years  and were as follows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year  compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the million increase in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal years to was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings of million  partially offset by a net decrease of million in non cash items  net  due primarily to the decrease in tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and a net change of approximately million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items 
the major contributors to the change in working capital items in fiscal year over fiscal year were accounts receivable  accrued expenses and inventory 
accounts receivable and inventory increased primarily due to the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international deliveries  which typically have a longer collection cycle than north america and a longer period from shipment to cost recognition 
the increase in inventories was also due to anticipated customer demands for both oncology systems and x ray products 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to an increase in deferred revenues and partially offset by a decrease in other accrued liabilities 
the increase in deferred revenues resulted from increasing revenue recognition deferrals related to timing of completion of installation of our software products and our growing sales of new products  as well as the higher international proportion of our oncology systems business with the accompanying longer period from shipment to revenue recognition 
the million increase in net cash from operating activities from fiscal years to was a result of an increase in net earnings of million and an increase in the tax benefit from employee stock options of million  partially offset by the change in working capital and non cash items  net  of million 
the major contributors to the change in working capital items in fiscal year over fiscal year were accounts receivable  accrued expenses  inventory and advance payments from customers 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher revenues in fiscal year the increase in inventories was primarily driven by inventories from our acquisitions and anticipated higher customer demands 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to an increase in accrued income taxes  which resulted from higher earnings in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and lower estimated tax payments for fiscal year advance payments from customers increased due to more down payments received for increased orders in fiscal years over we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  timing of product shipments  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
for additional discussion  see factors affecting our business in item investing activities provided million of net cash in fiscal year  compared to million and million of net cash used in fiscal years and  respectively 
our net proceeds from maturities of marketable securities were million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  compared to net purchases of marketable securities of million during fiscal year we used million of net cash for the purchase of businesses during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year and less than million in fiscal year financing activities used net cash of million in fiscal year compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we used million for repurchases of common stock and million for repayment of bank borrowings and received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
in fiscal year  we used million for repurchases of common stock and received million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
in fiscal year  we used million for repurchases of common stock and received million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
we expect our capital expenditures  which typically represent construction and or purchases of facilities  manufacturing equipment  office equipment and furniture and fixtures  to be approximately of revenues in fiscal year our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the united states and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate as a result of the shifting influences of these factors  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements through fiscal year we currently anticipate that we will continue to utilize our strong liquidity and cash flows from operations to repurchase our common stock  make strategic acquisitions  invest in the growth of our business and invest in systems and processes 
days sales outstanding trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding  or dso  were days at september   compared to days at october  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily impacted by timing of product shipments  collections performance and payment terms 
the increase in dso for fiscal year over fiscal year was related to our growing sales of new products and the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international sales  which typically have a longer collection cycle than north america  and slower collections performance for oncology systems in north america 
over the long term  we expect our dso to be around days 
stock repurchase program on february   our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to two million shares on a pre july  stock split basis of our common stock through february  on november   our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to three million shares on a pre july  stock split basis of our common stock over the period through august  on november   our board of directors announced a further repurchase of up to six million shares of our common stock through december  during fiscal years  and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  to repurchase  shares   shares and  shares  respectively  of our common stock 
all shares that have been repurchased have been retired 
as of september   we could still repurchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock under the november  authorization 
this authorization will expire on december  on any remaining shares of common stock not repurchased 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period in millions fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years beyond total long term debt interest obligation on long term debt operating leases mandatorily redeemable instrument total at september   we had million of long term debt 
long term debt  including current maturities  increased million from october  due to million loans assumed through purchases of land and buildings in las vegas  offset by principal repayment of million debt 
the fixed interest rates on the outstanding debt on this date ranged from to with a weighted average interest rate of 
the unsecured term loans of the long term debt currently contain a covenant that requires us to pay prepayment penalties if we elect to pay off this debt before the maturity dates and the market interest rate is lower than the fixed interest rates of the debt at the time of repayment 
it also contains covenants that limit future borrowings and cash dividend payments 
the covenants also require us to maintain specified levels of working capital and operating results 
for all fiscal years presented within the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the unsecured term loan agreements 
we lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in north america as well as various locations in europe  asia  australia and latin america 
operating leases include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases as of september  following a decision by mitsubishi electric co  or melco  to exit the radiotherapy equipment and service business and its desire to do so in a nondisruptive manner with an established radiotherapy equipment service provider  we entered into two separate transactions with melco contemporaneously whereby i we purchased melco s radiotherapy equipment service business to service melco s existing customers and ii we formed a three year joint venture  or jva  in japan with melco that was effective as of february  the joint venture was accomplished through melco s purchase on february   of a ownership interest in our japanese subsidiary  vms kk  for billion japanese yen  or us million 
at the end of the jva period  melco is required to unconditionally sell and we are required to unconditionally repurchase melco s ownership interest in vms kk at the original price billion japanese yen 
we accounted for melco s ownership interest as a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument and recorded such an instrument as long term liabilities totaling million at september  for further discussion regarding these two transactions with melco  see note  balance sheet components and note  commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
total debt as a percentage of total capital decreased to at september  compared to as adjusted at october  largely due to the increases in retained earnings and capital in excess of par value during fiscal year the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to to at september  from to as adjusted at october  environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations  these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials  and  in the event of such an incident  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
in addition  we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations 
for example  several countries are proposing to require manufacturers to take back  recycle and dispose of products at the end of the equipment s useful life 
the eu has adopted directives that when implemented will require medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of the products useful life  thus creating increased costs for our operations 
the eu has also adopted a directive that may require the adoption of restrictions on the use of some hazardous substances in certain of our products sold in the eu 
this directive could create increased costs for our operations 
from the time we began operating  we handled and disposed of hazardous materials and wastes following procedures that were considered appropriate under regulations  if any  existing at the time 
we also hired companies to dispose of wastes generated by our operations 
under various laws such as the federal superfund law and under our obligations concerning operations before the spin offs by the company of vi and vsea in  we are overseeing environmental cleanup projects from our pre spin offs operations  and as applicable  reimbursing third parties such as the us environmental protection agency or other responsible parties for cleanup activities 
under the terms of the agreement governing the spin offs  vi and vsea are each obligated to indemnify us for one third of these environmental cleanup costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds realized or tax benefits recognized by us 
the cleanup projects we are overseeing are being conducted under the direction of or in consultation with relevant regulatory agencies 
we estimate these cleanup projects will take up to approximately years to complete 
as described below  we have accrued a total of million at september  to cover our liabilities for these cleanup projects our estimate of future costs to complete certain cleanup activities ranges from million to million 
for these estimates  we have not discounted the costs to present dollars because of the uncertainties that make it difficult to develop a best estimate and have accrued million  which is the amount at the low end of the range 
for other cleanup projects  we have sufficient knowledge to develop better estimates of our future costs 
formal agreements with other parties defining the company s future liabilities or formal cleanup plans for these sites have been approved by or completed in accordance with requirements of the state or federal environmental agency with jurisdiction over the site 
while our estimate of future costs to complete these cleanup projects  including reimbursements to third party claims  ranges from million to million  our best estimate within that range is million 
for these projects we have accrued million  which is our best estimate of the million discounted to present dollars at  net of inflation 
at september   our reserve for environmental liabilities  based upon future environmental related costs estimated as of that date  was calculated as follows in millions recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs fiscal years thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as ongoing operation  maintenance and monitoring of cleanup while non recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as soil excavation and treatment  injection monitoring well installation and other costs for soil and groundwater in situ treatment by injection  ground and surface water treatment system construction  soil and groundwater investigation  certain governmental agency costs required to be reimbursed by us  governmental agency response costs including agency costs required to be reimbursed by the responding company  treatment system and monitoring well removal and closure  and costs to defend against and settle pending and anticipated third party claims 
when we developed the estimates above  we considered the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties 
these amounts are  however  only estimates and may be revised in the future as we get more information on these projects 
we may also spend more or less than these estimates 
based on current information  we believe that our reserves are adequate  but as the scope of our obligations becomes more clearly defined  these reserves and the associated indemnification obligations of vi and vsea may be modified and related charges credits against earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters described herein could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to our consolidated financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available to us and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events and assuming vi and vsea satisfy their indemnification obligations  we believe that the costs of these environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in any fiscal year 
we spent million  million and million  net of amounts borne by vi and vsea  during fiscal years  and  respectively 
we receive certain cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from defendants  its insurers and other third parties from time to time 
we have also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental related expenditures  and we therefore had a million receivable primarily included in other assets at september  we believe that this receivable is recoverable because it is based on a binding  written settlement agreement with a solvent and financially viable insurance company and the insurance company has paid the claims that we have made 
our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years  and over that time in the course of those operations  these facilities have used substances  that are or might be considered hazardous  and we have generated and disposed of wastes  that are or might be considered hazardous 
therefore  it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that we cannot now predict 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification of business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
as of september   we have not incurred any costs since the spin offs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that may require us to indemnify our directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers  and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any legal proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified 
generally  the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and  as a result  the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to two primary types of market risks foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as a global entity  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
adverse movements could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases are in europe  asia and australia 
we have significant transactions denominated in foreign currencies and address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s country  and adhere to a policy of hedging firmly committed foreign currency denominated sales orders 
these firmly committed foreign currency sales orders  excluding the amounts relating to the products made outside of the united states  are hedged with forward exchange contracts 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the forward exchange contracts range from one to twelve months in original maturity 
as of september   we did not have any forward exchange contracts with an original maturity greater than twelve months  but we may hedge beyond twelve months in the future 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units having us dollar functional currencies 
we enter into monthly foreign currency forward exchange contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional amounts of forward exchange contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
the fair value of forward exchange contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
a move in foreign currency exchange rates would change the fair value of the contracts  and the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would change in a similar offsetting manner 
accordingly  we believe that our hedging strategy should yield no material net impact to our results of operations or cash flows 
the notional values of sold and purchased forward exchange contracts for both hedges of foreign currency denominated sales orders and balance sheet exposures from our subsidiaries outstanding at september  are as follows in millions notional value sold notional value purchased unrealized gain loss fair value australian dollar british pound canadian dollar danish krone euro japanese yen new zealand dollar norwegian krone swedish krona swiss franc totals interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates depends primarily on our investment portfolio 
currently  our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid short term marketable securities  as well as a small amount of long term marketable securities 
in the unlikely event that interest rates were to decrease substantially  we might reinvest a substantial portion of our investment portfolio at lower interest rates 
we would consider additional debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate in our investment portfolio or long term debt  but may consider the use of derivative instruments in the future 
the principal amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of and an estimated average tax equivalent yield of 
the principal amount of marketable securities had an estimated average tax equivalent yield of at september  all of our marketable securities at september  were in municipal bonds 
our investment portfolio of marketable securities is primarily classified as held to maturity with the exception of our auction rate securities which are classified as available for sale  and any gains or losses relating to changes in interest rates would occur in the unlikely event of liquidation of all or part of the investment portfolio 
our debt of million at september  carried a weighted average fixed interest rate of with principal payments due in various installments over a ten year period 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term debt 
fiscal years dollars in millions thereafter total assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate marketable securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt average interest rate mandatorily redeemable instrument average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of which was held abroad at september  and could be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated in the united states approximated the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our debt is estimated to be million at september  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  it requires considerable judgment in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instrument could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
