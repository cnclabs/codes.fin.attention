overview cubist is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in lexington  massachusetts  focused on the research  development and commercialization of antiinfective products that address unmet medical needs 
we have one marketed product  cubicin that was approved in the united states for the treatment of csssi in september of we launched cubicin in november  and recognized net product sales of million and million in and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we hired additional sales people in order to expand our target market 
in  we continued to sell cubicin in accordance with our drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
we also maintain agreements with third parties to perform various supply chain activities  including manufacturing and supplying cubicin bulk drug substance  converting cubicin bulk drug substance into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation  managing warehousing and distribution of cubicin to our customers  and performing the order processing  order fulfillment  shipping  collection and invoicing services related to our cubicin product sales 
our focus in was to successfully launch cubicin and to direct our expenses towards the items that support the successful launch of cubicin in the united states 
these items include costs of goods sold  sales and marketing and research and development costs associated with completing the phase study of cubicin for the treatment of infective endocarditis and complicated bacteremia caused by s 
aureus 
we worked closely with chiron corporation under our october license agreement for the development and commercialization of cubicin in additional significant markets and announced in december that chiron had submitted a maa to the emea and the emea had accepted the maa under the european union s centralized procedure for approval to market cubicin 
we continued our efforts in to reduce our debt balance by repaying the outstanding principal and interest on our citizen s term loan and the remaining million of our senior convertible notes with john hancock life insurance company 
we completed the process started in to consolidate our discovery activities in the us and relocated our fermentation pilot plant from our former uk operations to our lexington  ma facility 
as part of the relocation of the plant  we upgraded it to a state of the art facility 
this fermentation pilot plant allows us to fine tune various aspects of the manufacturing process and assists with research efforts under our drug discovery research program 
our pipeline includes hepex b and research efforts focused on novel members of the lipopeptide class of molecules as well as our natural products program 
in  we discontinued clinical development of cab and octx 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  principally as a result of research and development efforts  pre clinical testing and clinical trials 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our investments in sales and marketing activities related to cubicin as well as research and development for other drug products with potential commercial viability 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues the following table sets forth and revenues together with the percentage change in revenues from year to year december change in millions product revenues  net license fee revenues collaborative agreement and other revenues total revenues product revenues  net net sales of cubicin were million and million in and  respectively 
gross sales of cubicin totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and are net of million and million of allowances for sales returns  medicaid rebates  chargebacks and prompt pay discounts 
we currently do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and out patient administration location purchases of our product 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking purchases and provisions for returns based on estimated product in the distribution channel 
license fee revenues total license fee revenues in the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in our license revenues from to primarily relates to our license agreement with chiron  which included up front payments totaling million  including a million premium paid upon purchasing our common stock 
this million was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to license fee revenues over the estimated development period of the agreement of two years 
revenue of million was recognized under this agreement during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  we currently expect to recognize million of the up front fee as revenue in assuming no change in our estimated development period 
also included in license fee revenues for the year ended december  is million of revenue  which was previously deferred  related to our cross license agreement with diversa corporation  or diversa 
under the agreement  diversa paid an up front license fee and pays annual license maintenance fees  until the licensed patents expire 
we were required to repay the up front license fee if  prior to november   we merged with or were acquired by a company whose primary business  prior to november   was related to molecular breeding involving in vitro dna shuffling 
accordingly  the entire upfront licensing fee was recorded as deferred revenue and was taken into revenue upon the expiration of the repayment provision in november collaborative agreement and other revenues total collaborative agreement and other revenues in the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in our collaborative agreement and other revenues from to primarily relates to i million of small business innovation research grants  or sbir grants  recognized in versus million recognized in  ii million of revenue recognized in related to funded development from chiron versus no revenue recognized in  and iii million in grant revenue related to our uk subsidiary versus no revenue in these increases were offset by a decrease of million in collaborative agreement and other revenues from to related to the completion in february of our research collaboration agreement with novartis under which we recognized million of revenue in versus no revenue in operating expenses the following table sets forth and operating expenses together with the percentage change in operating expenses from year to year december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expense cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively 
our gross margin for was as compared to for  primarily due to increased volume 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly 
as our production volumes increase there is the potential for our gross margin to increase as we work to develop manufacturing process improvements 
research and development expense total research and development expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase from to is primarily related to i costs of million associated with the research and development of hepex b which was in licensed in june of  ii an increase of million in salaries  benefits and other employee related expenses  iii an increase of million in clinical studies related to additional indications for cubicin  and iv million of expenses associated with the process of getting a second cubicin bulk drug substance manufacturer and a second fill finish site up and running for cubicin 
these increases were offset by decreases of i million in costs related to the cab and octx programs which were discontinued in  ii million of costs associated with getting the first cubicin bulk drug manufacturer up and running in  and iii million of facility related expenses primarily related to the closure of the uk facility in in march  we finalized the total number of employees that would relocate to the us from our us facility 
the total severance and outplacement costs for employees who did not relocate to the us and were terminated prior to or upon the august  closing of the uk facility was  million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas  this charge was taken ratably through the employees actual termination dates 
expense of million was recorded for the year ended december  although we will no longer incur costs related to the development of cab or octx  we expect to continue incurring substantial research and development expenses related to i phase b and phase clinical trials for cubicin  ii preclinical and clinical testing of other products under development  such as hepex b and potential compounds under our discovery research program  iii manufacturing and formulation development costs related to hepex b  iv regulatory matters  v medical affairs activities  and vi costs associated with the validation and qualification of a second fill finish facility with cardinal  where they will provide fill finish and packaging services for finished cubicin product 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily related to an increase of million in salaries  benefits  travel and other employee related expenses due to having a fully staffed cubicin sales and marketing group in place for all of as well as an increase of million in marketing and promotional programs for cubicin 
selling and marketing expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue our commercialization efforts related to cubicin in the us and expand our sales force by people in the first quarter of general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily relates to the lease termination charges of million recorded in related to our former uk facility 
in february  our uk subsidiary entered into a binding letter of intent to lease approximately  square feet of additional space in slough  england  commencing in february for a term of fifteen years 
in the third quarter of we decided that we would not occupy the additional space 
in accordance with sfas an expense of million was recorded for the year ended december  based on the execution of an agreement in january to buy out of the lease for million payable in two lump sum payments in january and september sfas requires that a liability be recorded for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at its fair value in the period during which the liability is incurred 
the million included million of lease termination costs  a million write off of construction in progress costs  million in other tenant related costs  and an elimination of the deferred rent liability of million related to the facility s lease term 
we made the first payment of million million in january and the final payment of million million in september under the lease termination agreement 
this decrease was offset by a million patent impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of as well as a million increase in professional services fees 
the patent impairment was determined as a result of the most recent assessment of future revenue streams related to the patent 
we estimated that the discounted future cash flows from the patent  unrelated to our cubicin product  was less than its carrying value  resulting in the million impairment charge 
other expense  net the following table sets forth and other expenses together with the percentage change in other expenses from year to year december  change in millions interest income interest expense other expense total other expense  net interest income and expense interest income in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or

license fee revenues total license fee revenues in the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in our license revenues from to primarily relates to the mutual termination in september of a european commercialization agreement with gilead sciences  which accounted for million in license fee revenue and million of milestone revenue in and no revenue in in the fourth quarter of  we signed a license agreement with chiron  which included up front payments totaling million  including a million premium paid upon purchasing our common stock

the decrease from to primarily related to a decrease of million in clinical study costs related to cubicin development that were incurred in and not in  decrease in license fee expense of million  and a decrease in lab services and supplies of million partially offset by i million of costs related to the development of the manufacturing process for cubicin and ii million of milestone expense to sandoz for completion of a cab dosing study in humans 
during  based upon current information received from each contract research organization  or cro  we reversed previously recorded accrued clinical trial expense of million by crediting research and development expense 
the accruals established for these clinical trials were based upon information received from each cro and represented our best estimate of services provided but not yet invoiced by the cros 
we did not pay out any amounts related to the reversed expense  and in fact  received reimbursement from one cro of approximately million of previously paid amounts 
our research and development costs primarily consist of salaries  benefits and other head count related costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract and other outside service fees  quality assurance  quality control  medical affairs and the development of a manufacturing process for cubicin 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses in the year ended december  were million compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or

the decrease in interest income was due to the decrease throughout the year of our cash and cash equivalents balance as well as lower average yields on our investments 
interest expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in interest expense from to was the result of our initiative to restructure our balance sheet and improve our capital structure

we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future related to the continued development and commercialization of cubicin for additional indications  the development of our other drug candidates  as well as investments in other product opportunities 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net loss for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to the year ended december   while net cash used for operating activities remaining flat year over year 
this is primarily due to payments made in january and september of million million related to our lease termination in slough  england  an increase of million in accounts receivable and inventory from to resulting from our cubicin launch and the recognition in of million of revenue related to license payments received in and our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures and strategic investments 
purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  were million as compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

we also purchased approximately million worth of software related to regulatory record keeping  document management and marketing activities for cubicin and spent approximately million to build out and furnish our additional space at hayden avenue  lexington  massachusetts 
in  we expended million for computer hardware and software primarily related to development of a sales automation system 
during  we expended approximately million for lab equipment and million for computer hardware primarily due to company growth 
net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments 
in  we plan to invest in additional computer hardware  software and development equipment related to the fermentation pilot plant 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to million provided by financing activities in the year ended december  and million used for financing activities in in  million was generated from our public offering of shares  offset by million in principal  interest and early payment penalty on our senior convertible notes to john hancock life insurance company  or john hancock  and million in principal payments related to our bank term loan

these inflows were offset by a million payment on our senior convertible notes to john hancock 
net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to approximately million in repayments of debt with no significant inflows from financings 
on september   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to register the offering on a delayed or continuous basis of million of common stock 
the registration statement became effective on november  on november   we amended the registration statement to increase the aggregate offering price from million to million  resulting in the issuance of approximately  additional shares of common stock  based on a per share offering price of

in october we repaid the outstanding principal and interest of million under this facility 
on october   we completed the private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes less financing costs of million

we have subleased the space located at sidney street through october the inventory purchase obligations listed above represent minimum volumes that we are required to purchase from our contract manufacturers 
the external collaborations listed above represent minimum collaboration support payments as well as minimum royalties owed on sales of cubicin product 
critical accounting policies and estimates cubist prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  accrued clinical research costs  investments  long lived assets  and income taxes 
i 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab as amended by sab  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
for all revenue transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin  license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaborative agreements with other biotechnology companies 
product revenues  net we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts and rebates are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales in the same period the related sales are recorded 
since the launch of cubicin in november  we have not allowed wholesalers to stock cubicin  instead we instituted a drop ship program that we have continued to maintain 
under our drop ship program  orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and outpatient administration centers 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and outpatient administration center purchases of our product  and also prevents unusual purchasing patterns since it closely tracks end user demand 
to date  we have not offered any sales incentives to customers 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date 
our estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including industry data of product return rates  historical experience of actual returns  analysis of level inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if the history of our product returns changes  the reserve will be adjusted appropriately 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking and activity and provisions for returns which will be based on estimated product in the distribution channel that may not sell through to end users 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves quarterly 
our medicaid and chargeback reserves have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for end user sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid rebates based on an analysis of customer data 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
our calculation also requires other estimates  including estimates of sales mix  to determine which sales will be subject to chargebacks and medicaid rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of rebate can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
reserves for rebate programs are included in accrued liabilities and were  and  at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts and chargebacks are netted against accounts receivable and were  and  at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model that we currently operate under  and the low level of actual chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims experienced to date  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
multiple element arrangements we analyze our multiple element arrangements entered into after june   to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
we currently have an arrangement that includes an up front license payment and that obligates us to perform development services and to manufacture and supply drug product 
the pricing for the manufacturing and supply services was determined to be at fair value 
although the license was determined to have standalone value  we could not establish fair value for the development services and  as such  the license and development services are being accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
accordingly  the up front license payment is being recognized over the estimated development period of two years 
our estimate of the development period and our determination that the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement are at fair value both involve management judgment 
license revenues prior to adopting eitf  non refundable license fees were recorded as deferred revenue once received and are generally recognized ratably over the development period to which they related only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
if cubist is obligated to provide significant assistance to enable the customer to practice the license  then the revenue is recognized over the period of such obligation 
the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized and as a result  management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of product development quarterly 
milestones revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
research services revenues from research funding are recognized when the services are performed in order to match revenues to expenses incurred 
revenues from sbir grants to conduct research and development are recognized as the eligible costs are incurred up to the granted funding limit 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in first out fifo method 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
iii 
accrued clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as contract research organizations  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
contracts and studies vary significantly in length  and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs that have a dollar limit cap  and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies to the extent possible through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope  and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
clinical trial expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of the study  the required level of patient enrollment  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those with a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements and that span multiple years 
we currently have three clinical trials in progress 
the only trial that is significant in size and complexity is our phase clinical trial of cubicin for the treatment of infective endocarditis and complicated bacteremia caused by s 
aureus 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
iv 
investments it is our intent to hold all investments to maturity in accordance with our investment policy 
however  if the circumstances regarding an investment were to change  such as a change in an investment s external credit rating  we would consider a sale of the related security to minimize any losses 
the appropriateness of all investment classifications is reviewed at each reporting date 
v 
long lived assets in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate plant and equipment using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic life  which ranges from years to years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of our corporate headquarters building 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgment and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangibles assets are impaired 
based on an internal analysis  the company estimated that the undiscounted future cash flows from a patent  unrelated to its cubicin product  were less than its carrying value  indicating that the patent was impaired 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million based upon the difference between the expected discounted future cash flows and its carrying value 
the million charge was recorded to general and administrative expense in the quarter ended december  vi 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards  and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we determine that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through december   we believe it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or over many periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity  or vie  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
in december  the fasb released a revised version of fin hereafter referred to as fin r clarifying certain aspects of fin and providing certain entities with exemptions from the requirements of fin the variable interest model of fin r was only slightly modified from that contained in fin a vie would be required to be consolidated if either of the following conditions are met the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including equity holders 
the equity investors lack any one of the following three characteristics of a controlling financial interest the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an entity s activities that have a significant effect on the success of the entity 
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity 
the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
fin r requires the application of either fin or fin r by public entities to all special purpose entities  or spes  created prior to february  at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  all entities created after january  by public entities were already required to be analyzed under fin  and they must continue to do so  unless fin r is adopted early 
fin r is applicable to all non spes created prior to february  by public entities that are not small business issuers at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the adoption of fin and fin r had no effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires the determination of the fair value of the share based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
sfas no 
r permits a prospective or two modified versions of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original sfas no 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective july   at which time the company will begin recognizing an expense for unvested share based compensation that has been issued or will be issued after that date 
since we currently account for stock options granted to employees and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plans in accordance with the intrinsic value method permitted under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense is recognized 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in a prior period  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  or sfas sfas requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we currently own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve capital until it is required to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments is held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to our policy to hold these instruments to maturity  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december   the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes due in amounted to million 
the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes and capital lease obligations is fixed and is therefore not subject to interest rate risk
