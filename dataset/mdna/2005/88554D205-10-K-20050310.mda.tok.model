item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k 
certain statements contained in this discussion may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully herein 
the forward looking information set forth in this annual report on form k is provided as of the date of this filing  and we undertake no duty to update that information 
more information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled cautionary statements and risk factors below 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  market and service rapid d printing  prototyping and manufacturing systems and related products  materials and customer services that enable complex three dimensional objects to be produced directly from computer data without tooling  greatly reducing the time and cost required to produce prototypes or customized production parts 
our consolidated revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our systems  the sale of the related materials used by the systems to produce solid objects and the provision of services to our customers 
we brought in new senior management late in and early in and re assigned some capable existing management 
our new management team embarked on a number of changes to re direct the company and to improve operating and financial performance 
specifically  during the latter part of and during  we took the following actions established clear priorities developed a comprehensive strategy recruited and realigned the management team recapitalized the business settled significant litigation created strategic alliances effected corporate governance changes implemented preferable accounting policies strengthened our financial controls entered into a new revolving credit facility introduced new products outsourced equipment assembly operations migrated some of our convertible debt to equity improved operating results the operating and financial impacts of the foregoing positive changes have begun to be reflected in our financial results 
because of our stronger operating and financial base  we expect that we can now direct more of our focus to growth initiatives 
there can be no assurance that our operations or financial results will continue to improve or that we will succeed in our growth initiatives 
growth strategy we are pursuing a growth strategy that focuses on seven strategic initiatives improving our customer s bottom line developing significant product applications expanding the range of customer services accelerating new product development optimizing cash flow and our supply chain creating a performance based ethical culture developing people and opportunities improving our customer s bottom line 
we believe that our success depends on the success of our customers 
understanding our customers objectives and businesses should enable us to quickly incorporate their needs into our product offerings and to offer them effective solutions to their business needs 
by offering them effective solutions to their needs  we should be able to provide them with solutions that significantly improve their own profitability 
developing significant product applications 
we believe that our ability to focus on industries that provide significant growth opportunities enables us to accelerate the adoption of our business solutions and to create significant new applications for a continually expanding customer base 
by focusing our efforts on two significant addressable opportunities  d printing and rapid manufacturing  we are working to build a business model that can provide sustained growth  that has predictable performance characteristics  and whose performance should be less sensitive to cyclical economic behavior 
expanding our range of customer services 
we believe that our desire to improve our customer s bottom line demands the creation of new and innovative services designed to meet specific customer needs 
we are working to establish faster  simpler business practices designed to make our customers experience with us easier and friendlier 
accelerating new product development 
we believe that our growth depends on our ability to bring to market new materials  systems and services through quick and targeted development cycles 
technology and innovation are at the heart of this initiative 
as an industry leader  we believe that the only sure way to sustain growth is through our commitment to technological leadership 
optimizing cash flow and supply chain 
we believe that our profitability  competitiveness and cash flow should be enhanced by our ability to optimize our overall manufacturing operations and supply chain 
through the implementation of lean order to cash operations  coupled with selective strategic outsourcing  we are working to derive tangible operating improvements and to improve our overall return on assets 
creating a performance based ethical culture 
we believe that the success of our strategic initiatives will depend on our ability to execute them within the framework of a performance based culture that seeks to meet the needs of our customers  stockholders and other constituencies within the framework of a corporate culture that is committed to strong principles of business ethics and compliance with law 
we recognize the need to align our performance with our organizational capabilities and practices and our strategic vision to enable us to grow at the rate we expect  to drive operating improvements at the rate we expect  and to make the progress against targets necessary to create the necessary alignment 
developing people and opportunities 
we believe that our success depends heavily on the skill and motivation of our employees and that we must therefore invest in the skills that our employees possess and those that we need to accomplish our strategic initiatives 
as with any growth strategy  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in accomplishing our strategic initiatives 
results the following table sets out the amounts and percentages of our revenue by class of product and service for each of the three years ended december  dollars in thousands systems and other products    materials    services    totals    consolidated revenue increased in compared to  continuing a trend that began in the fourth quarter of our consolidated revenue in and had decreased compared to the immediately preceding years 
revenue from each of our classes of products and services also increased in compared to while we believe that d printing and rapid manufacturing present us with opportunities for growth  our traditional rapid prototyping business continues to be another important opportunity and a core part of our business 
during  we worked to rejuvenate and reshape our core business while developing new products that address our growing d printing and rapid manufacturing opportunities 
throughout the year  we launched several new stereolithography materials including accura si  an abs like material  and accura si material  a specialty fast build material designed for our sla legacy systems 
we also commercialized several new proprietary plastic  metal and engineered nano composite materials designed to deliver certain desired metal and plastic parts attributes and performance characteristics 
along with these new materials  we launched two manufacturing capable systems that address the needs of our core business as well as our rapid manufacturing opportunities 
for we introduced new products and services from the latter part of through the end of certain of these new products contributed significantly to our higher level of revenue in revenue from new products and services in was of consolidated revenue 
we recorded operating income of million arising out of our higher revenue  an improved gross profit margin and lower operating expenses 
this was the first year in which we reported operating income since we recorded million of net income available to common stockholders in compared to a million loss in this was primarily the result of higher operating income  lower interest and other expense  net  and the absence of cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles  partially offset by higher preferred stock dividends 
new equipment systems since the latter part of  we have introduced several new systems that use the technologies drawn from each of our three technology platforms  including in the fourth quarter of  our standard model of the invision d printer  in june  the invision hr d printer  a new model of d printer that has a high resolution capability that enables jewelry  dental  medical implant and precision alloy manufacturers to produce fine feature  highly detailed parts rapidly  in july  the sinterstation hiq sls system  a new manufacturing capable selective laser sintering system  and in october  the viper ha sla system  a dual vat stereolithography system for the production of hearing aid shells 
new materials since the latter part of  we have also introduced several new materials  including in  visijet materials for d printing applications  in  amethyst materials for stereolithography applications  in  laserform a steel based materials for selective laser sintering applications  in july  bluestone sl material  a new engineered nano composite material for sla systems  dsm somos stereolithography materials  which we have begun to distribute  in september  accura si sl material in two colors for sla systems to provide parts with a look and feel similar to molded abs thermoplastic parts  in september  four additional visijet color materials for the invision d printer  and in november  accura si sl material for our sla system 
other new products during  we also announced the availability of other new products  including ls software for sls systems  the invision finisher for the invision d printer  and the proclean sl part washer for stereolithography parts 
during  we also introduced several service contract alternatives to offer additional  flexible service contract options to our customers  and we entered into distribution agreements with certain suppliers of stereolithography materials that should enable us to broaden the range of materials that we can supply to our stereolithography customers 
outsourcing of equipment assembly activities in july  we announced that we had begun to engage selected design and manufacturing companies to assemble our equipment portfolio  including our invision d printers and our viper sla systems 
subsequently  one of these companies began to assemble our invision d printers  and another began to assemble our viper sla systems 
by the end of  we had outsourced substantially all of our equipment assembly activities to these engineering and assembly suppliers and outsourced to them the refurbishment of used equipment systems and the assembly of field service kits as well 
the cost of implementing these outsourcing activities amounted to approximately million in we do not expect future costs of implementing these outsourcing activities to be material 
we do  however  expect that they will lead to lower costs and that they will enable us to reduce our inventories related to our systems and their related parts and components 
for a discussion of the financial effect of these activities in  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and liquidity and capital resources below 
we are also working with these suppliers on several development projects for new generations of sla and sls systems that we expect to commercialize in we believe that transitioning non core activities such as assembly operations to specialty companies that have developed equipment assembly as one of their core competencies should enable us to improve the quality and cost of our systems and should lead to an improvement in our financial operating profile 
cash flow and liquidity in december  we called our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures for redemption 
as of december   all of the holders of these debentures had converted them into  shares of common stock 
the conversion of these debentures will eliminate million of annual interest expense for and future years and shifted of our capitalization from subordinated debt to stockholders equity 
as of june   we entered into a million secured revolving credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
we did not make any borrowings under that facility during  and we do not intend to borrow against it given our current cash position and our currently anticipated future cash flow 
we view this facility as a liquidity backstop that may also be used for foreign currency exposure management and letter of credit issuances  and in that regard we had million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with silicon valley bank at december  see liquidity and capital resources outstanding debt 
while we continued to consume cash in our business during the first nine months of as we worked to resolve our legacy legal and other matters  cash provided by operating activities was million for the full year as a result of our stronger overall operating performance 
our unrestricted balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of was million  an increase of million compared to the end of see liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow 
resolution of legacy legal issues during  we settled on terms favorable to us all of the lawsuits pending from and prior years 
most notably  the long standing litigation between us and eos gmbh was settled early in february  and in october the sec informed us of its decision to close its investigation without any enforcement action with respect to us 
we recorded million of legal and related costs in selling  general and administrative expenses in resolving these matters in see legal proceedings 
changes in management as we have previously disclosed  beginning in the latter part of  we brought new management to our company 
a number of senior management positions were filled with individuals from outside our company who have many years of relevant management experience  and other managers were re assigned 
beginning late in the third quarter of  we hired a new chief executive officer  chief financial officer  general counsel and new head of operations  and  in  we hired a new head of global sales and head of engineering 
also  three capable existing managers were re assigned to head global marketing  global services and technology 
see executive officers 
results of operations for  and consolidated revenue the principal factors affecting our consolidated revenue in the three years ended december  were changes in unit volume  the combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices  and foreign currency translation 
for  consolidated revenue increased to million from million in consolidated revenue in decreased from million in the increase in consolidated revenue in was primarily due to higher unit sales in each of our classes of products and services and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
sales of new products and services introduced since the latter part of  increased by million to million  which increase was partially offset by a decline in unit sales of our mature equipment systems and materials 
new systems and materials introduced since the fourth quarter of that contributed to our higher revenue in included our standard invision d printer  our high resolution invision hr d printer  the sinterstation hiq sls system and visijet  amethyst and laserform a materials 
revenue from other new products was not material to our operating results in the decline in consolidated revenue in compared to was due primarily to the worldwide economic slowdown that affected and although those adverse effects were partially offset by the added revenue of dtm corporation  which we acquired in august the year was the first year in which revenue from dtm s operations was included for a full year 
other factors that adversely affected our revenue in these years also included increased demand by customers for lower cost and smaller frame systems  a reduction in the volume of stereolithography materials that we sold following the termination of our distribution agreement with vantico  inc in and the subsequent introduction of our own stereolithography materials  limited new product introductions  and customer concerns regarding our financial performance and stability 
foreign currency had a million favorable impact on consolidated revenue in and a million favorable impact in due to the strengthening in each year of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar 
excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation  consolidated revenue would have increased for and would have decreased for revenue in included a license fee of million that we received from sony corporation for a license of certain of our north american patents and software copyrights for use in the field of stereolithography in north america pursuant to a settlement that we entered into with the us department of justice of a civil action that it had commenced in to permanently enjoin our acquisition of dtm corporation 
in addition  in  we recorded million in cost of sales associated with this license fee that we were obligated to pay to the original owner of these patents 
revenue by class of product and service the components of the change in revenue by class of product and service for are shown in the following table  together with the corresponding percentage of that change compared to the level of revenue for that product or service 
systems and other products materials services net change in consolidated revenue dollars in thousands volume core products and services   volume new products and services    price mix   foreign currency translation 
   net change in consolidated revenue   as set forth in the tables on pages and revenue from systems and other products increased to million in from million in but remained below its level of million in revenue from systems and other products represented  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
revenue from materials increased to million for from million for and million in revenue from materials represented  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
revenue from services increased to million for from million for and million in revenue from services represented  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from systems and other products in was primarily due to million arising from higher unit sales of our new systems and a favorable million effect of foreign currency translation  partially offset by a million decline in unit sales of our mature equipment systems and a million combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices 
the partially offsetting effect of product mix and average selling prices on revenue from systems was primarily due to price declines in mature systems 
the continuing decline in systems sales as a percentage of consolidated revenue reflected primarily the price change differential between mature systems and materials from to the decrease in revenue from systems and related products in was primarily due to a million decrease in volume and a million decrease in average selling prices  partially offset by million arising from the favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the decreases in volume and average selling prices arose primarily from a shift in product mix from larger frame to smaller frame systems worldwide 
our sales of small frame systems benefited modestly in from new applications  including hearing aids and jewelry 
in addition  other systems revenue  mostly derived from rentals  royalties and other products  decreased by million 
systems orders and sales tend to fluctuate from period to period as a result of a number of factors  including the types of systems ordered by customers  customer acceptance of new products  the timing of product shipments  world economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our systems are generally purchased by our customers as capital equipment items  and purchasing decisions may have a long lead time 
due to the price of certain systems  including our mature systems  and the overall low unit volumes  the acceleration or delay of shipments of a small number of mature systems from one period to another can significantly affect our system sales and the associated product mix for the period involved 
the increase in revenue from materials in was primarily due to million arising from higher unit sales of new products  a million favorable combined effect of price and mix and a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation  partially offset by a million decline in unit volume of our mature materials 
in  a million increase in volume of materials sold and a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation related to materials sold was largely offset by million arising from lower average selling prices 
the increase in revenue from services in was primarily due to million arising from higher unit volume and to the million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the higher unit volume in was primarily derived from services related to our new invision d printers and installation of upgrade kits for sinterstation hiq sls systems  and  to a lesser extent  from expanded services for mature systems 
the higher level of revenue from services in was due primary to a million increase in revenue from upgrading existing products and a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation associated with service activities  partially offset by a million decrease in maintenance  warranty and other revenues 
revenue by geographic region each geographic area in which we operate contributed to our higher revenue in compared to that in revenue by geographic area in which we operate is shown in the following table 
year ended december  dollars in thousands us operations    european operations    asia pacific operations    total revenue    the components of the changes in revenue by geographic region for are shown in the following table  together with the corresponding percentage of that change compared to the level of revenue for that geographic area 
us europe asia pacific net change in consolidated revenue dollars in thousands volume     price mix   foreign currency translation 
 net change in consolidated revenue  as set forth in the foregoing tables revenue from us operations was essentially flat in compared to  and it remained below its level of million in as lower unit volume was offset by the combined effect of price and mix 
during  we focused on the restructuring and realignment of our us sales organization  which was completed by year end 
revenue from us operations represented  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
revenue from operations outside the us increased to of consolidated revenue for from of consolidated revenue for and for excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation only for the current year  revenue from operations outside the us would have been of consolidated revenue for and of consolidated revenue for revenue from european operations increased to million for from million for  reversing a decline from million in including the effect of foreign currency translation  european revenue was  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
revenue from asia pacific operations increased to million for from million for and million for including the effect of foreign currency translation  asia pacific revenue was  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue in europe and the asia pacific region in was primarily due to higher unit volume and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation in each geographic area  partially offset  in the case of europe  by the combined effect of product mix and lower average selling prices for systems 
excluding the million favorable effect of foreign currency translation  revenue from operations outside the us would have increased for compared to the million decrease in revenue from us operations in was primarily due to a million decrease in systems revenue and a million decrease in materials revenue  partially offset by a million increase in service revenue 
the decline in systems revenue in resulted primarily from a change in product mix from larger frame systems to smaller frame systems which led to a million increase in volume that was more than offset by a million decline in average selling prices for systems and a million decline in revenue from other products 
the decrease in materials revenue resulted from a million decrease in average selling prices that was partially offset by a million increase in volume 
the small increase in service revenue resulted primarily from an increase in product up grade revenue  partially offset by a decrease in installation and service revenue 
consolidated revenue from operations outside the united states  primarily in europe and the asia pacific region  was million in and million in  as changes in revenue from our products and services were almost completely offset by the favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
for information with respect to revenue by geographic area  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the decrease in european revenue in included million arising from the favorable effect of foreign currency translation  which was more than offset by a million decrease in volume and a million decrease in average selling prices for systems  materials volume increases of million that were more than offset by average selling price decreases of million  and service revenue decreases of million as a result of a reduction in service maintenance contracts 
the increase in asia pacific revenue in resulted primarily from a million increase from higher average selling prices across our product lines  a million increase in materials volume  and million arising from the favorable effect of foreign currency translation  partially offset by a million decrease in volume of systems sales 
costs and margins cost of sales increased to million in from million in  reflecting our higher revenue  and it declined to of consolidated revenue in from of consolidated revenue in cost of sales declined in from million in  representing of consolidated revenue in the increase in cost of sales in was due primarily to our higher revenue  partially offset by a favorable net impact of product and service costs and mix changes 
systems costs per unit were generally lower due to manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies  partially offset by production ramp up costs associated with the introduction of new products and under absorbed direct manufacturing costs associated with the outsourcing of our equipment assembly activities to third parties 
materials costs increased on balance as a result of mix changes 
service costs benefited from lower warranty costs and performance efficiencies 
the decrease in cost of sales in resulted primarily from the effect of lower revenue partially offset by a million effect of foreign currency translation 
cost of sales in also included million attributable to the change in accounting principle relating to the discontinuance of the unit of production method of amortization for one of our patent licenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as noted below under severance and other restructuring costs  during and  we took steps to reduce our direct labor costs as a result of the lower level of revenue 
we experienced an improvement in our gross profit and gross profit margin in compared to  reversing a decline that had occurred from to gross profit increased to million from million in and million in the million increase in gross profit in was due primarily to increased revenue including favorable foreign exchange translation effects on revenue and favorable mix changes 
the million decline in gross profit in was due primarily to changes in product mix 
our materials revenue  increases in service revenue and product upgrades contributed favorably to gross profit 
however  these favorable effects were more than offset by a decrease in margins from sales of our systems that arose from the change in product mix referred to above 
our gross profit margin increased to of consolidated revenue in compared to in and in gross profit margin for products increased to of consolidated product revenue in from of consolidated revenue and of consolidated product revenue 
the increase in product margins in was due primarily to increased revenue  including net favorable foreign currency effects  net cost increases which were proportionately less than revenue increases for the reasons mentioned above and favorable mix changes  partially offset by costs associated with carrying out customer conversions to our materials from materials provided by other suppliers 
gross profit margin on services increased to of consolidated service revenue for from of consolidated service revenue and of consolidated service revenue 
service margins in continued to benefit from higher revenues and lower costs associated with lower warranty costs and greater performance efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses we experienced declines in selling  general and administrative expenses during compared to for  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to million from million in in  these expenses increased million from million in selling  general and administrative expenses were  and of consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to a million decline in legal costs  primarily related to reduced patent litigation costs as a result of litigation settlements during  and the absence in of legal fees incurred in related to our revenue recognition investigation relating to and previous years  million of lower bad debt expense  the absence in of the million impairment charge in related to technology associated with the curtailed product commercialization efforts in our optoform sarl unit  million of lower accounting fees associated with the absence in of costs incurred in related to our revenue recognition investigation  and million of lower costs related to depreciation  travel and entertainment expenses  outside vendor processing costs  consulting professional fees and utility costs  partially offset by million of higher fees and expenses related to our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and million of higher employee compensation  recruitment and relocation expenses 
in  legal costs amounted to million compared to an adjusted million in these costs included million of fees and expenses associated with the completion of the settlement of the eos gmbh and hitachi zosen litigations and with our compliance with the sec and department of justice subpoenas 
on october   we received a letter from the sec stating that it had closed its investigation and did not intend to recommend any enforcement action with respect to us 
see legal proceedings 
during  we began to realize the benefit of replacing our previous self insured medical benefit program with an insured program in february employee benefit expenses declined in primarily as a result of the adoption of this new insured program and included a million decrease in our reserve for future claims under the former self insured program 
we realized cost savings of million in from the reductions in workforce and improved cost controls undertaken in and and million in lower commissions  but these cost savings were more than offset by million of legal and other professional fees incurred in investigations related to our revenue recognition practices related to prior years conducted by the audit committee and the securities and exchange commission  a department of justice inquiry and other litigation and million of executive recruitment and other expenses 
in addition  as of december   we changed our accounting policy of capitalizing legal fees incurred in the defense of our patent rights  resulting in additional legal fees of million being charged to selling  general and administrative expenses in see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we also evaluated our intangible assets relating to our acquisition of optoform sarl at december  and determined that approximately million of the value of the intangible assets arising from that transaction was impaired 
we accordingly wrote off that amount to selling  general and administrative expenses 
bad debt expense  which amounted to million in  was reduced by million in to a million credit 
tighter credit and collection management also resulted in a day reduction in days sales outstanding dso from days in to days in and a million reduction in receivables more than days past due from the end of to the end of bad debt expense for was approximately million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the amounts expensed in the fourth quarter of included million relating to the sale of certain assets of our keltool business to a company that became insolvent late in the million remainder of our bad debt expense for consisted of trade receivables and was recorded over the course of as circumstances indicated that collection of those amounts was unlikely 
approximately million of these trade receivables related to customers with financial difficulties  and the balance of them related to customers with payment disputes relating to matters such as product performance 
this bad debt expense included specific allowances of million  million  million and million for trade receivables that were originally invoiced in   and  respectively 
while we believed prior to that the prior year receivables were collectible based on the facts and circumstances at that time  during we made the judgment based on changed circumstances that additional specific reserves should be taken as the economic environment during and the latter part of resulted in financial difficulties for certain customers  as we considered other relevant factors related to these receivables on a case by case basis  and as we tightened our working capital management efforts 
as required by sfas no 
revised  which relates to the expensing of stock options and certain other equity compensation  we intend to begin to expense previously issued equity awards for which service has not been rendered beginning on july  as of december   we estimate our maximum expense for existing stock option awards as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r to be approximately million  of which million would be recognized for the second half of  million would be recognized for and million would be recognized for this projected expense will change if any stock option awards are granted or cancelled prior to the respective reporting periods or if any changes are required to be made for estimated forfeitures as of july  research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in after being reduced from million in we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in as we continue to devote our efforts on selected research and development projects and that they should be in the range of to of consolidated revenue due to increased activity with selected projects 
the decrease in research and development expenses in was primarily due to cost savings realized from the reductions in workforce and other cost saving measures undertaken in and that are discussed below 
severance and restructuring costs severance and other restructuring costs amounted to million in and million in  but in both years they were substantially below their level of million in we accrued million of severance expenses during in connection with the outsourcing of our equipment assembly activities in grand junction  colorado  a personnel realignment in europe and certain other personnel changes in the united states  which we expect to be our total cash outlay for these severance expenses 
we had expended million of these severance expenses at december  and expect to expend the remainder in while we expect that the outsourcing of our equipment assembly operations should result in lower costs  we are not yet in a position to predict the amount of any cost savings 
in previous restructuring activities in july  we closed our office in austin  texas  which we had acquired as part of our acquisition of dtm corporation in  and our sales office in farmington hills  michigan 
with respect to the closing of these facilities  we accrued million in covering a portion of the exit costs from such facilities for the remaining terms of the underlying leases  one of which expired in and the other of which expires in the unaccrued portion of these facilities exit costs  amounting to million at december   reflected a reduction in the exit costs arising from sublease rent that we estimated would be received for portions of the remaining terms of such leases 
because those facilities had not yet been subleased  we accrued an additional million of those exit costs during to fully provide for the estimated remaining exit costs 
we expect our cash outlays to implement these closures to be up to million  and we expect to realize million in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis from the closure of these facilities  which savings should be realized in the future once the exit costs are paid 
we carried out several reductions in force in and substantially all of the restructuring costs that we accrued in connection with these reductions in force had been expended as of december   and those restructurings had been substantially completed as of that date 
our cash outlays to implement these reductions in force were million 
we estimated that approximately million in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis were realized by the end of as a result of the headcount reductions implemented pursuant to these reductions in force and the related savings in compensation and employee benefit expense 
we do not expect to realize any material amount of additional savings on an annual run rate basis from those reductions in force 
in  we eliminated approximately positions from our workforce 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded severance expense of million in in connection with these reductions 
in  we implemented two reductions in workforce worldwide resulting in the elimination of positions 
as discussed above  in july  we also closed our offices in austin  texas and farmington hills  michigan 
all costs incurred in connection with these restructuring activities are included as severance and other restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   our restructuring reserve for unexpended restructuring costs amounted to million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  income loss from operations as a result of our higher consolidated revenue  our higher gross profit margin and our relatively lower operating costs and expenses discussed above  we recorded million of income from operations in  representing of consolidated revenue for operating loss for declined from million in to million in as the decline in our operating costs was partially offset by a decline in gross profit 
on a geographic basis  we recorded operating losses in the united states in each year  which included primarily research and development expenses  legal fees and expenses  and certain other operating expenses incurred in the united states 
depreciation and amortization declined to million in compared to million in and million in the decline in depreciation and amortization in was primarily the result of reduced depreciation associated with lower levels of fixed assets and  to a lesser extent  the lower level of capital expenditures during and interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net  which consists primarily of interest expense  decreased to million for from million in and million in the decrease in was due primarily to the absence in of interest expense associated with borrowings under a credit facility with us bank  national association that we repaid and terminated in the fourth quarter of and an increase in interest income arising from the short term investment of excess cash  partially offset by added interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated debentures that we issued in the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in december  we called our convertible subordinated debentures for redemption  and as of december  all of those debentures had been converted into common stock 
as a result  we will not incur the million of annual interest expense associated with those debentures in and future years 
provisions for income taxes we recorded a million provision for income taxes in both and compared to an million provision for income taxes in our and tax provisions arose primarily from taxes on foreign operations 
during  our deferred tax assets declined by million  primarily from the use of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income  and our deferred tax liabilities declined by million  primarily related to amortization of intangibles 
as a result  our net deferred tax assets and our valuation allowance declined by million 
the accumulated valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decline in our provision for income taxes in was due primarily to the absence in of the million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets originating in and prior years that we recorded in during  we recorded an million tax benefit arising primarily from our net loss for the year  and we increased our valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets by the same amount in light of our cumulative and continuing losses 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as discussed above  as of december   we changed our method of accounting for legal fees incurred in the defense of our patents and license rights and of amortizing one of our patent licenses 
we adopted such changes retroactively to january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as a result  for  we recorded a cumulative effect of such changes in accounting principles of approximately million  net of applicable income tax effect  in addition to the million incremental increase in selling  general and administrative expenses mentioned above and a million increase in cost of sales 
net income loss we recorded net income of million for compared to net losses of million in and million in the principal reasons that we reported net income in were our operating income in compared to an operating loss in the decrease in interest and other expenses  net in  and the absence  in  of the million cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles discussed above  that were partially offset  with respect to net income available to common stockholders  by a million increase in dividends and accretion of issuance costs in with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock 
the principal reasons for our higher net loss in were the absence in of the effect of the million arbitration gain that we recorded in  the million cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles discussed above  and with respect to net loss available to common stockholders  the accrual of million of dividends on our series b convertible preferred stock  which began in  that more than offset the million reduction in our loss from operations  and the million reduction in our provision for income taxes 
the arbitration gain in arose from a settlement that we entered into in with vantico  inc in connection with the termination of a distribution agreement and a research and development agreement that provided for vantico to pay us million  which was satisfied when vantico delivered million shares of common stock to us in april we recorded million of that settlement as other income  million as a reimbursement for legal and professional fees and the balance in stockholders equity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  net income available to common stockholders for was million  after giving effect to million of dividends and accretion of preferred stock issuance costs with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock 
on a per share basis  basic income per share available to the common stockholders in was and such fully diluted income per share was 
in  for the reasons set forth above  our net loss available to common stockholders was million or per share of common stock basic and diluted 
excluding the million cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles discussed above  net loss available to common stockholders was million or per share of common stock 
these net losses in also included the preferred stock dividends mentioned above  including accretion of preferred stock issuance costs 
in december  we paid million in dividends to the holders of the series b convertible preferred stock 
on a per common share basis  the effect of such dividends on the common stockholders was to increase the loss per share available to common stockholders in by per share 
the dilutive effects of our outstanding stock options for the period  and of the convertible subordinated debentures and series b convertible preferred stock in the and periods  were excluded as they would have been anti dilutive 
our net loss available to common stockholders in was million or per share of common stock basic and diluted 
liquidity and capital resources during the three years ended december   our principal sources of liquidity were the net proceeds from external financing transactions  cash flow from operations and  in  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
working capital our net working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in cash and cash equivalents at december   a million reduction in accrued liabilities  a million reduction in deferred revenue  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  partially offset by a million reduction in accounts receivable  net  and a million reduction in inventory  net 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents arose primarily from our net cash from operating activities in  which was partially offset by the net effect of the cash used in investing activities and provided by financing activities and by the effect of exchange rate changes on cash 
the million reduction in accrued liabilities arose primarily from a million reduction in accrued health costs  a million reduction in taxes payable  a million reduction in royalties payable  a million reduction in accrued liquidated damages  the absence in of the million accrual for regent pacific settlement costs  which were paid during  and million of other reductions in accrued liabilities  including reductions in payroll and related taxes  in the amounts to be paid to the former rpc shareholders and in accrued professional services  partially offset by million relating to the product financing arrangements discussed below  a million increase in the accrual for bonuses and commissions  a million increase in the accrual for severance and restructuring costs  and a million increase in other accruals  including interest and sales and use taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the million reduction in deferred revenue resulted primarily from the timing of the renewal of certain customer service contracts and of the recognition of revenue on certain sales of systems 
the million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets arose primarily from our recording at december   in accordance with sfas no 
 a million non trade receivable from  and million of progress payments to  certain of the equipment assemblers that we engaged during to assemble our invision d printing equipment  our viper sla systems and certain other equipment items  to refurbish used equipment systems and to assemble field service kits for sale by us to our customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the reductions in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and the other items of working capital not discussed above arose in the ordinary course of business 
in connection with our outsourcing activities  we agreed to sell to those third parties components of our raw materials inventory related to those systems 
those sales made through december  have been recorded in the financial statements as a product financing arrangement under sfas no 
 accounting for product financing arrangements 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we recorded the million non trade receivable classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december  reflecting the book value of the inventory sold to the assemblers 
at december   million remained in inventory  and we had recorded a corresponding accrued liability representing our non contractual obligation to repurchase assembled systems and refurbished parts produced from such inventory 
such amount is included in the accrued liabilities discussed above 
under these arrangements  the company generally purchases assembled systems from the assemblers following our receipt of an order from a customer or as needed from the assembler to repair a component or to service equipment 
under certain circumstances  we anticipate that we may purchase assembled systems from the assemblers prior to the receipt of an order from a customer 
at december   we had made million of progress payments to an assembler for systems forecasted to be required for resale to customers after december  in connection with these outsourcing arrangements  we expect to continue to supply raw materials inventory related to the assembly of our systems to our third party assemblers until they make arrangements to obtain such materials from third party suppliers 
we expect the non trade receivable referred to above to be reduced by payments made to us by the assemblers for inventory sold to them 
the amount recorded as inventory held by the assemblers and the amount of such non trade receivable increases as we sell additional inventory to the assemblers  and the related accrued liability referred to above decreases as we purchase from the assemblers assembled systems produced from such inventory 
components of inventories were as follows in thousands of dollars december  december  raw materials   inventory held by assemblers work in process  finished goods   total   cash flow the following table summarizes the cash used in or provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  as well as the effect of exchange rate changes on cash  for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by financing activities    effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   cash flow from operations net cash provided by operating activities in was million  which resulted from our million of net income and the combined million net effect of non cash depreciation and amortization and changes in operating accounts in the ordinary course of business 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million as substantially all of our net loss of million was offset by changes in non cash expenses and in operating accounts 
the changes in the operating accounts arose in the ordinary course of business 
non cash items included a million charge for the cumulative effect through december  of the changes in accounting principles discussed above  an million impairment for intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of optoform sarl  which we recorded at december   million of depreciation and amortization  million of adjustments to allowance accounts  and million of equity compensation expense 
net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  of million primarily resulted from the decrease in the accounts receivable balance of million and the decrease of inventories of million partially offset by a net loss of million which included a non cash gain from the vantico settlement of million  a non cash charge of million resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and adjustments to allowance and reserve accounts of million 
furthermore  cash provided by operations decreased due to a decrease in accounts payable of million 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million 
investing activities in consisted principally of purchases of property and equipment  additions to licenses and patents and software development costs 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in we expect our capital expenditures in to be in the range of million to million  primarily for information technology systems and hardware 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  reflecting our reduced level of capital expenditures and the absence of capitalized patent legal defense costs relating to the change in accounting principle with respect to such costs that is discussed above 
net cash used in investing activities in was million 
these investing activities primarily related to additions to licenses and patents of million related to capitalized patent legal fees and new patent filings  additions to property and equipment of million for machinery and equipment  scheduled payments of million for the optoform acquisition  and million in payments for the rpc acquisition 
these acquisitions were completed in cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
the principal source of cash from financing activities in was million received primarily from the exercise of stock options 
cash was used to pay preferred stock dividends  to pay liquidated damages and stock registration costs related to registration of previously issued securities  to make the semi annual repayments required to be made in under our industrial development bonds and to pay certain other obligations that came due during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
the principal sources of cash from such activities in were million of net proceeds arising from the issuance of our series b convertible preferred stock and our convertible subordinated debentures 
we used million of cash to repay bank debt outstanding with us bank  national association 
as a result  we had repaid all of our previously outstanding bank debt as of december  net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
the principal sources of cash from such activities in were million in proceeds from the sale of common stock and million of long term debt  partially offset by million in repayments of long term debt 
liquidity as discussed above  during the three years ended december   our principal sources of liquidity were the net proceeds from external financing transactions  cash flow from operations and  in  proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
as noted above  our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to the million of cash generated in our operations in and the million of cash provided by financing activities  which were partially offset by million of cash used in investing activities 
outstanding debt our outstanding debt at december  and was as follows dollars in thousands line of credit current portion of long term debt industrial development revenue bonds long term debt  less current portion industrial development bonds   subordinated debt convertible subordinated debentures convertible subordinated debentures   total subordinated debt   silicon valley bank loan and security agreement as of june   we entered into a two year loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
this credit facility provides that we and certain of our subsidiaries may borrow up to million of revolving loans and includes sub limits for letter of credit and foreign exchange facilities 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien in favor of silicon valley bank on certain of our assets  including domestic accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings at either the bank s prime rate in effect from time to time or at a libor rate plus 
we are obligated to pay  on a quarterly basis  a commitment fee equal to per annum of the unused amount of the facility 
the facility imposes certain limitations on our activities  including limitations on the incurrence of debt and other liens  limitations on the disposition of assets  limitations on the making of certain investments  and limitations on the payment of dividends on our common stock 
the facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  which include a a requirement to maintain a quick ratio as defined of at least to as of december  and of at least to as of march  and thereafter  b a requirement to maintain  at any time any revolving obligations as defined are outstanding under the facility equal to or in excess of million  unrestricted cash in the united states in an amount not less than two thirds of the amount of the outstanding revolving obligations  c a requirement to maintain  if there are any advances as defined outstanding under the facility at the end of any calendar quarter  a ratio of total liabilities less subordinated debt to tangible net worth as each such term is defined of not more than to as of december  and as of march  and thereafter of not more than to  d a requirement to maintain  if there are any advances outstanding under the facility at the end of any calendar quarter  a tangible net worth as defined of not less than the sum of million plus the amount of any tangible net worth additions as defined  and e a requirement to maintain domestic tangible assets of not less than of adjusted tangible assets as such terms are defined 
we were in compliance with these requirements at december  at december   we had million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding with silicon valley bank 
no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under this facility at december   and we do not currently expect to borrow under this credit facility due to our current cash position and our currently anticipated future cash flow 
however  we expect this credit facility to provide us with additional liquidity as we grow and that it will allow us to better manage our foreign exchange exposure 
industrial development bonds our colorado facility was financed by industrial development bonds in the original aggregate principal amount of million 
at december   the outstanding principal amount of these bonds was million 
interest on the bonds accrues at a variable rate of interest and is payable monthly 
the interest rate at december  was 
principal payments are due in semi annual installments through august we have made all required payments of principal and interest on these bonds 
the bonds are collateralized by  among other things  a first mortgage on the facility  a security interest in certain equipment and an irrevocable letter of credit issued by wells fargo bank  na pursuant to the terms of a reimbursement agreement between us and wells fargo 
this letter of credit is in turn collateralized by million of restricted cash that wells fargo holds 
the reimbursement agreement contains financial covenants that require  among other things  that we maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the reimbursement agreement of million plus of net income from july  forward and a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the reimbursement agreement of no less than 
as of december  and december   we were in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum tangible net worth covenant under this reimbursement agreement 
however  as we have previously disclosed  during  we operated under waivers of default under these financial covenants 
on march   we and wells fargo entered into an amendment to the reimbursement agreement which stated that we were no longer in default of the financial covenants referred to above and that therefore wells fargo would no longer require us to replace the wells fargo letter of credit or to retire million of the industrial development bonds  as it had previously indicated it might require us to do 
such amendment also amended certain of the criteria used to measure compliance with such financial covenants 
it also added a provision that provides that we acknowledged that  upon the occurrence of any future event of default under the reimbursement agreement  wells fargo would not consider waiving such event of default unless and until we comply with all requirements imposed by wells fargo  which would include but not be limited to the immediate retirement of million of the industrial development bonds 
the amendment provides that funds for such repayment shall come first from our restricted cash then held by them  if any  and the balance from additional funds to be provided by us to the trustee of such bonds by us promptly upon notice from wells fargo 
in addition  any event of default would result in an increase to the letter of credit fee from of the stated amount of the letter of credit to of the stated amount of the letter of credit prorated from the occurrence of such event of default until the next august  when the fee is due  and continuing for the life of the letter of credit 
we are required to demonstrate our compliance with the financial covenants discussed above as of the end of each calendar quarter 
convertible subordinated debentures the convertible subordinated debentures were issued late in and were convertible at a price of per share of common stock into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at any time at the option of the holders 
the debentures bore interest at the rate of per year  payable quarterly  and were subordinated to all senior indebtedness as defined 
they were redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time after december  at an amount equal to of their aggregate principal amount 
as discussed above  in december  we called the outstanding convertible subordinated debentures for redemption 
as of december   all of the holders of these debentures had converted them into  shares of common stock 
the conversion of these debentures will eliminate million of annual interest expense for and future years 
convertible subordinated debentures the convertible subordinated debentures bear interest at the rate of per year payable semi annually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year 
they are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holders at any time prior to maturity at per share  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
they are currently convertible into approximately million shares of common stock 
we have the right to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  commencing on november  at a price equal to of the then outstanding principal amount of the debentures being redeemed  together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due in respect of the debentures 
if we undergo a change in control as defined  the holders may require us to redeem the debentures at of their then outstanding principal amount  together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due in respect of the debentures 
the debentures are subordinated in right of payment to senior indebtedness as defined 
at the time the debentures were issued  we granted registration rights to the purchasers of the debentures pursuant to which  subject to certain terms and conditions  we agreed to file a registration statement to register for resale under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  the shares of common stock into which the debentures are convertible 
the conditions to our obligation to file such registration statement have not yet been satisfied  and no such registration statement is currently pending 
commitments and contingencies we lease certain facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring through the leases are generally on a net rent basis  under which we pay taxes  maintenance and insurance 
leases that expire are expected to be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties

after giving effect to voluntary conversions in   shares of the series b convertible preferred stock were outstanding at december  reflects amounts owing to the former shareholders of rpc ltd 
under an agreement entered into with them in and our obligation to compensate certain stockholders who acquired shares of common stock in private placement transactions for our failure to maintain an effective registration statement that would permit such holders to sell such shares 
series b convertible preferred stock the series b convertible preferred stock accrues dividends  on a cumulative basis  at per share each year while it remains outstanding 
prior to may   the cumulative dividend rate was per share per year 
the series b convertible preferred stock is senior to our common stock and any other stock that ranks junior to the series b convertible preferred stock 
dividends are payable semi annually  when  as and if declared by the board of directors  on may and november of each year while these shares remain outstanding 
in addition  the series b convertible preferred stock votes equally with our common stock and  as of december   is convertible at any time at the option of the holders on a share for share basis into  shares of common stock 
the series b convertible preferred stock is redeemable at our option at any time after may  we must redeem any shares of series b convertible preferred stock that remain outstanding on may  the redemption price in either case is per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
at the time of its issuance  we agreed to prepare and file a registration statement under the securities act in order to register for resale the common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when we consider it to be appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and our outstanding industrial development bonds 
we seek to minimize the risk to our cash investments by investing cash in excess of our operating needs in short term  high quality instruments issued by highly creditworthy financial institutions  corporations or governments 
a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operation 
from time to time  we may use derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  collars or options  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  and  we had no such financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt and preferred stock varies with changes in interest rates and the market fluctuations for our common stock 
generally  the fair value of these fixed rate instruments will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these instruments also contain options to convert them into shares of our common stock  and the fair value of these instruments is affected by our stock price and stock volatility 
at december   the carrying value of our total debt had declined to million from million at december  this consisted of million of fixed rate debt at december  and million of fixed rate debt at december  the principal reasons for the decline in the carrying value of our total debt at december  were the conversion at the end of of our convertible subordinated debentures into common stock and the making of the principal payments due during on our floating rate industrial development bonds 
the carrying value of our series b convertible preferred stock was million at december  and the estimated fair value of our total debt was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  this value includes  with respect to our fixed rate convertible securities  the cost of replacing these securities with borrowings at current rates and comparable maturities on the assumption that these securities will remain outstanding until their mandatory redemption dates 
the fair value of our fixed rate instruments is an estimate  which includes discounting of the outstanding balance to reflect current market rates of interest and an estimation of the value of the conversion options based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model attempts to value the options while giving effect to the term of the option  the exercise or strike price  the market price of our common stock and an estimate of the volatility of our common stock 
such changes in the fair value of our fixed rate instruments do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt or the total liquidation value of our outstanding preferred stock at maturity 
the increase in estimated fair value of our fixed rate instruments outstanding at december  was predominantly the result of a change from to in the interest rate used to discount the contractual payments associated with the instruments and  with respect to the value of the conversion options  an increase in the year end market price of our common stock into which the instruments are convertible from per share at december  to per share at december  this increase was partially offset by the conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures in the fourth quarter of a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would result in a change in the estimated fair value of our debt at december  of million 
foreign exchange rates we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
more than of our consolidated revenue is derived from sales outside of the us this revenue is generated primarily from the operations of our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and surrounding geographic areas and is primarily denominated in each subsidiary s local functional currency although certain sales are denominated in other currencies  including us dollars or the euro  rather than the local functional currency 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in their local functional currency 
these currencies include the euro  pound sterling  swiss franc and japanese yen 
the geographic areas outside the united states in which we operate are not considered to be highly inflationary 
nonetheless  these foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currencies 
our operating results as well as our assets and liabilities are also subject to the effect of foreign currency translation when the operating results  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of foreign currency related items on our consolidated statements of operations resulted in a million gain in  compared to a million loss in and a million gain in the unrealized effect of foreign currency translation in resulted in a million gain that was recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income  compared to a million gain in and a million gain in at december   a hypothetical change of in foreign currency exchange rates would cause a change of million to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and a million change in revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we purchase from time to time materials and finished products from vendors that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity 
we hedge certain of the associated short term payment liabilities using forward contracts 
at december   the notional amount of these foreign exchange forward contracts totaled million 
at december   we had a remaining million swiss franc approximately million obligation to the former stockholders of rpc  ltd 
which accrues interest at a fixed rate and the balance of which is due to be paid during we have hedged these principal and interest payment obligations using foreign currency forward contracts 
as noted above  we may use derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency options  to fix or limit our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income or loss 
commodity prices we use various commodity raw materials and energy products in conjunction with our manufacturing processes 
generally  we acquire such components at market prices and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components 
a hypothetical change in commodity prices for raw materials would cause a change of million to cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition set forth in this annual report on form k is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make critical accounting estimates that directly impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
critical accounting estimates are estimates that meet two criteria the estimates require that we make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and there exist different estimates that could reasonably be used in the current period  or changes in the estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  both of which would have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventory  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  contingencies and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following represent what we believe to be the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies  the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of our related disclosures herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of systems and related products is recognized upon shipment or when services are performed  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists upon execution of a written sales agreement that constitutes a fixed and legally binding commitment between us and the buyer 
sales of our systems generally include equipment  a software license  a warranty on the equipment  training and installation 
we allocate and record revenue in these transactions based on vendor specific objective evidence that has been accumulated through historic operations  which  in most cases  is the price charged for the deliverable when sold separately 
if fair value for all deliverables cannot be determined  we will use the residual method to determine the amount of the consideration to be allocated to the delivered items 
we also evaluate the impact of undelivered items on the functionality of delivered items for each sales transaction and  where appropriate  defer revenue on delivered items when that functionality has been affected 
functionality is determined to be met if the delivered products or services represent a separate earnings process 
revenues from services are recognized at the time of performance 
we provide end users with maintenance under a warranty agreement for up to one year and defer a portion of the revenues at the time of sale based on the relative fair value of those services 
after the initial warranty period  we offer these customers optional maintenance contracts 
deferred maintenance revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the period of the contract 
our systems are sold with licensed software products that are integral to the operation of the systems 
these software products are generally sold or licensed only for use in our systems 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers for equipment sales are included in product revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
costs we incur that are associated with shipping and handling are included in product cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
certain of our sales prior to were made through a sales agent to customers where substantial uncertainty existed with respect to collection of the sales price 
the substantial uncertainty was generally a result of the absence of a history of doing business with the customer and an uncertain political environment in the country in which the customer conducted business 
for these sales  we recorded revenue based on the cost recovery method  which requires that the sales proceeds received are first applied to the carrying amount of the asset sold until the carrying amount has been recovered 
thereafter  all proceeds are credited to sales 
all revenue associated with these transactions was recorded prior to december  credit is extended  and creditworthiness is determined  based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
new customers are generally required to complete a credit application and provide references and bank information to facilitate an analysis of creditworthiness 
customers with a favorable profile may receive credit terms based on that profile that differ from our general credit terms 
creditworthiness is considered  among other things  in evaluating our relationship with customers with past due balances 
our terms of sale generally require payment within to days after shipment of a product although we also recognize that longer payment periods are customary in some countries where we transact business 
to reduce credit risk in connection with systems sales  we may  depending upon the circumstances  require significant deposits prior to shipment and may retain a security interest in a system sold until fully paid 
in some circumstances  we may require payment in full for our products prior to shipment and may require international customers to furnish letters of credit 
for services  we either bill customers on a time and materials basis or sell customers service agreements that are recorded as deferred revenue and provide for payment in advance on either an annual or other periodic basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet our financial obligations for example  bankruptcy 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change for example  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet our financial obligations that it has to us  the estimate of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur  and because the impact of recognizing additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and in our results of operations 
income taxes we and our domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return 
our non us subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions 
we provide for income taxes on those portions of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated earnings that we believe are not reinvested indefinitely in their business 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using enacted tax rates 
we record deferred tax assets arising from temporary timing differences between recorded net income and taxable net income when and if we believe that future earnings will be sufficient to realize the tax benefit 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  require the establishment of a valuation allowance when  based on currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas no 
provides that an important factor in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is whether there has been sufficient income in recent years and whether sufficient income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in  we determined  based upon our accumulated losses and our continuing operating losses  that it was more likely than not that we would not be in a position to realize our deferred tax assets in future years 
accordingly  in  we increased our valuation allowance to million  which reduced the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets to zero 
during  we recorded an million tax benefit arising primarily from our net loss for the year  and we increased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by the same amount 
at december   our accumulated valuation allowance was million 
at december   as a consequence of the use of million of our deferred tax assets primarily attributable to net operating loss carryforwards  partially offset by a million decline in our deferred tax liabilities  attributable to intangibles  our net deferred tax assets and our valuation allowance declined by million to million 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal or reduction of the allowance 
if in future periods we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to recognize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will at that time reverse or reduce the valuation allowance 
we believe that our estimate of deferred tax assets and our determination to record a valuation allowance against such assets are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to  among other things  an estimate of future taxable income in the united states  which is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur  and because the impact of recording a valuation allowance may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and in our results of operations 
the determination of our income tax provision is complex due to our having operations in numerous tax jurisdictions outside the united states  which are subject to certain risks  which ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes  which may be applied on a retroactive basis 
if this were to occur  our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported 
furthermore  as explained in the preceding paragraph  in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  we adopt the liability method as required by sfas no 
this method requires that we establish a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  in our judgment it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
our reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
our determination of the allowance for inventory obsolescence is subject to change because it is based on management s current estimates of required reserves and potential adjustments 
we believe that the allowance for inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur and because the impact of recognizing additional obsolescence reserves may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and in our results of operations 
goodwill and intangible and other long lived assets we applied sfas no 
 business combinations  in the allocation of the purchase prices when we acquired dtm corporation  rpc ltd 
and optoform sarl in the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to use our judgment and could require us to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
as required by sfas no 
 we have allocated goodwill to identifiable reporting units  which are tested for impairment using a two step process detailed in the statement 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with our carrying amount  including goodwill 
if that fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the second step of the process is not required to be performed  and no impairment charge is required to be recorded 
if that fair value does not exceed that carrying amount  companies must perform the second step that requires an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a purchase business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price 
the goodwill resulting from that purchase price allocation is then compared to the carrying amount with any excess recorded as an impairment charge 
pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 we are required to perform a valuation of our reporting units annually  or upon significant changes in our business environment 
we performed an evaluation of our reporting units upon implementation of sfas no 
in january  and for the years ended december   and and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment adjustments were recorded for these years for goodwill that was recorded as part of the acquisition of dtm and rpc 
we evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value  a write down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value 
at december   we determined that an impairment of the acquired technology and other long lived assets arising from the acquisition of optoform sarl had occurred as it had become unlikely that the technology would be commercialized 
accordingly  future cash flows from this component of our reporting units are expected to be negligible 
we recorded the estimated impairment amount of million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our determination whether or not to recognize an impairment of goodwill or of intangible assets or other long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change  dependent upon estimates of the fair value of our reporting units  and because the impact of recognizing an impairment may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and to our results of operations 
contingencies we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate our contingencies  and accordingly  under the guidance of sfas no 
 no contingency has been recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of apb opinion no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the language used in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
with respect to accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and spoilage 
the guidance does not result in a substantive changes in accounting for these costs but eliminates inconsistencies in wording between us and international accounting standards 
as such  this pronouncement is not expected to have any material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary transactions an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which will become effective on july  apb no 
generally requires that exchanges of non monetary assets be measured based on fair value of the assets exchanged but provided an exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets  which did not result in a change in carrying value for the new asset acquired even if the cash flows resulting from the exchange would change significantly 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
non monetary exchanges lack commercial substance if the cash flows to the entity will not change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have any material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  that establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share based payments for services provided by employees 
this pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications  cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting july  compensation expense for new equity awards  in most cases  will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the service period 
an award of a liability instrument  as defined by this pronouncement  will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement 
under the terms of this pronouncement  we and other issuers will begin to expense equity awards using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
for periods before the required effective date for which financial statements have not yet been issued  we have the option to elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required by statement no 
we do not intend at this time to elect to apply the modified version of retrospective application  but we instead intend to begin to expense previously issued equity awards for which service has not been rendered beginning july  as of december   we estimate our maximum expense for existing stock option awards to be approximately million  which would be recognized million for  million for and million for this projected expense will change if any stock option awards are granted or cancelled prior to the respective reporting periods or if there are any changes required to be made for estimated forfeitures as of the effective date 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan that  as currently written  would be subject to sfas no 
as revised in this plan would be a compensatory plan as defined by this pronouncement 
we have determined that the impact of adopting this standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements with respect to the employee stock purchase plan 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including the discussion in cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve risks and uncertainties as well as assumptions that  if they never materialize or prove incorrect  could cause our results and the results of our consolidated subsidiaries to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward looking statements  including the difficulty of keeping expense growth at modest levels while increasing revenues  any projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operations  any statement concerning proposed new products  services or developments  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
these statements may use words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  predict  project and similar expressions as they relate to us or our management 
any forward looking statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  using information currently available to us 
we assume no obligation  and do not intend  to update these forward looking statements 
if one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize  or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results may vary materially from what we projected 
any forward looking statement you read in this annual report on form k reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations  results of operations  growth strategy and liquidity 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or individuals acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph 
you should specifically consider the factors identified in this annual report on form k which would cause actual results to differ 
cautionary statements and risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
in that event the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
our debt level could adversely affect our financial health and affect our ability to run our business 
as of december   our debt had declined from million at the end of to million 
this debt included million of principal payments due in under the industrial development bonds covering our colorado facility  and million due in installments under those bonds through this debt also includes million of our convertible subordinated debentures that are due in we also have outstanding approximately million shares of series b convertible preferred stock that is required to be redeemed in at a liquidation value of million excluding accrued and unpaid dividends 
this level of debt and preferred stock could have important consequences to you as a holder of shares 
we have identified below some of the material potential consequences resulting from this significant amount of debt and preferred stock we could be unable to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
our ability to adapt to changing market conditions could be hampered 
we could be more vulnerable in a volatile market and at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt 
our operating flexibility could be limited by restrictive covenants contained in credit documents such as restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on properties  making acquisitions and paying dividends and requirements that we satisfy certain financial covenants such as the maintenance of certain levels of net worth  interest coverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios or other financial covenants 
we could be subject to the risks that interest rates  interest expense and fixed charges will increase 
our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in our business may be more limited 
our operating results may be insufficient to achieve compliance with financial covenants in financing documents  thereby causing acceleration of outstanding debt 
during  we generated operating income for the first time since  reflecting higher revenue  higher gross margins and lower operating expenses for the year 
at the end of and  we were in compliance with the financial covenants that applied to us under our various financings 
we cannot assure you that this favorable trend will continue 
our reimbursement agreement with wells fargo bank  na related to a letter of credit supporting the industrial development bonds outstanding at december  contains two financial covenants 
one covenant requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of 
the other covenant requires us to maintain tangible net worth as defined of million plus of net income subsequent to july  as of december  and  we were in compliance with both the fixed charge coverage ratio and the tangible net worth covenant 
nevertheless  if our current improved operating trend does not continue and we suffer future losses  those losses could cause us to breach either or both of these covenants 
we previously received waivers from wells fargo bank when we breached the fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of and the third quarter of on march   we entered into an amendment to the reimbursement agreement with wells fargo that states that  with respect to defaults under such covenants in  we are no longer in default of the financial covenants referred to above and that therefore wells fargo will no longer require us to replace the wells fargo letter of credit or to retire million of the industrial development bonds  which it had previously suggested it might require us to do 
such amendment also amended certain of the criteria used to measure compliance with such financial covenants 
it also added a provision that we acknowledged that  upon the occurrence of any future event of default under the reimbursement agreement  wells fargo will not consider waiving such event of default unless and until we comply with all requirements imposed by wells fargo  which shall include but not be limited to the immediate retirement of million of the industrial development bonds 
the amendment provides that funds for such repayment shall come first from our funds then held by wells fargo  if any  and the balance from additional funds to be provided by us to the trustee of such bonds promptly upon notice to us from wells fargo 
in addition  any event of default would result in an increase to the letter of credit fee from of the stated amount of the letter of credit to of the stated amount of the letter of credit prorated from the occurrence of such event of default until the next august  when the fee is due  and continuing for the life of the letter of credit 
we are required to demonstrate our compliance with these financial covenants as of the end of each calendar quarter 
in  we entered into a million two year secured revolving credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
that credit agreement also contains various financial covenants that we are required to comply with 
see liquidity and capital resources outstanding debt 
we were in compliance with those covenants at december  we had no outstanding borrowings under that facility at december   and we do not currently intend to make any borrowings under it given our cash position at december  nevertheless  if we were to fail to comply with those covenants at any time  we could be prevented from using the facility for borrowings  foreign currency transactions and letters of credit  and we could be required to pay any amounts outstanding under the facility 
if we were unable to generate net cash flow from operations or if we were unable to raise additional capital  our financial condition would be adversely affected 
as discussed above  was the first year since that we generated income from operations  and  in the period from late through  we depended heavily on external financings to provide us with cash for our operations 
even if the favorable trend in our operations that developed beginning in late continues  we cannot assure you that we would generate funds from operations or that capital would be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources to fund future operating costs  debt service obligations and capital requirements 
the lack of additional capital resulting from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations and would  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  we cannot assure you that any necessary funds  if available  would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing stockholders 
if our financial condition worsens and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or other strategic transactions  we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy 
our balance sheet contains several categories of intangible assets totaling million that we could be required to write off or write down based on the impairment of certain of those assets and our future performance  which could adversely impact our future earnings and stock price  our ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our customer relationships 
as of december   we had million of unamortized intangible assets  consisting of licenses  patents  acquired technology and other intangibles that we amortize over time 
any material impairment to any of these items could reduce our net income and could affect the trading price of our common stock 
at december   we had million in goodwill capitalized on our balance sheet 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  required  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and the introduction of impairment testing in their place 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and some indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset over the fair value of the underlying asset 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant  and such testing could result in write downs of some of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
accordingly  we could  from time to time  incur impairment charges  which would be recorded as operating expenses when they are incurred and would reduce our net income and adversely affect our operating results 
for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and significant estimates goodwill and intangible and other long lived assets 
the mix of products that we sell could cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our gross margins  and those fluctuations in margins could cause fluctuations in net income or net loss 
we work to expand continuously our product offerings  including our systems  materials and services  the number of geographic areas in which we operate and the distribution channels we use to reach various target product applications and customers 
this variety of products  applications and channels results in a range of gross margins and operating income which can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations depending upon the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter 
we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross margins or net income due to the impact of the mix of products  channels or geographic areas in which we sell our products from period to period 
more recently  our mix of products sold has reflected increased sales of our lower cost and smaller frame systems  which may have lower gross margins compared to high end stereolithography systems 
if this trend continues over time  we may experience lower average gross margins and returns 
we may be subject to product liability claims  which could result in material expense  diversion of management time and attention and damage to our business reputation 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that  despite testing  are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers 
this could result in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
we attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products 
however  the nature and extent of these limitations vary from customer to customer  and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense to  diversion of management time and attention and damage to our business reputation and ability to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
political and economic events and the uncertainty resulting from them may have a material adverse effect on our market opportunities and operating results 
the us military campaigns against terrorism in iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere and continued violence in the middle east have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and revenue 
as a result of these uncertainties  spending on capital equipment of the type that we sell may be weaker than spending in the economy as a whole 
these uncertainties may also lead our customers in certain industries that are adversely affected by them not only to delay purchases of equipment and systems but also the materials and services that we sell as well 
the long term effects of these uncertainties on our customers  the marketplace for our common stock  the market for our services and the us economy as a whole are uncertain 
the consequences of any additional terrorist attacks or of any expanded armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities or our business 
we face significant competition in many aspects of our business  which could cause our revenue and gross margins to decline 
the competition in our industry could cause us to reduce sales prices or incur additional marketing or production costs  which could result in decreased revenue  increased costs and reduced margins 
we compete for customers with a wide variety of producers of equipment for models  prototypes and other three dimensional objects as well as producers of materials and services for this equipment 
some of our existing and potential competitors are researching  designing  developing and marketing other types of competitive equipment  materials and services 
many of these competitors have financial  marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than those of ours 
except for the sinterstation hiq sls system that we introduced in june and the viper ha sla system introduced in october  we have not introduced any significant product advances in our sla or sls systems in  or these factors may have negatively affected our ability to compete effectively 
any reduction in our research and development efforts generally could affect our ability to compete effectively 
the existence of competitors extends the purchase decision time as customers investigate the alternative products and solutions 
in june  we entered into a license agreement with sony corporation pursuant to the terms of our consent decree with the us department of justice under which we license to sony certain of our patents for use in the manufacture and sale of stereolithography equipment in north america the united states  canada and mexico 
sony is an extremely large and sophisticated corporation with substantial resources  and we anticipate that it will aggressively compete in all aspects of our stereolithography business 
as discussed above  in february  we settled all of our outstanding litigation with eos gmbh 
as a result of that settlement  eos will be able to sell certain systems and other products in the us in exchange for the payment of royalties to us 
we also expect that future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques for equipment and materials that are not encompassed by our patents  from the issuance of patents to other companies that inhibit our ability to develop certain products and from the improvement to existing materials and equipment technologies 
we intend to follow a strategy of continuing product development to enhance our position to the extent practicable 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition 
if we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products  we may lose revenue and demand for our products 
we are affected by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices  any of which could render our existing products and proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
we believe that our future success may depend on our ability to deliver products that meet changing technology and customer needs 
we believe that sales of our sla and sls systems have declined in part because  except as noted above  we have not introduced any significant advances in these products during the past three years 
to remain competitive  we must continually enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products  services and technologies 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to develop or obtain leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing products  develop new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers  particularly in the area of materials functionality  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis  and recruit and retain key technology employees 
we depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for components and sub assemblies used in our systems and raw materials used in our materials 
if these relationships were to terminate  our business could be disrupted while we locate an alternative supplier and our expenses may increase 
a discussed above  we purchase components and sub assemblies for our systems and purchase raw materials that are used in our materials from third party suppliers 
while there are several potential suppliers of the material components  parts and subassemblies for our products  we currently use only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of these components  including our lasers  materials and certain ink jet components 
our reliance on a single or limited number of vendors involves many risks including potential shortages of some key components  product performance shortfalls  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing capabilities  quality and costs 
if any of our suppliers suffers business disruptions or financial difficulties  or if there is any significant change in the condition of our relationship with the supplier  our cost of goods sold may increase and we may be unable quickly to obtain these components from alternative sources 
while we believe that we can obtain all of the components necessary for our products from other manufacturers  we require any new supplier to become qualified pursuant to our internal procedures  which could involve a day to day process 
we generally have our systems assembled based on our internal forecasts 
any unanticipated change in the source of our supplies  or unanticipated supply limitations  could increase production or related costs and consequently reduce margins 
in addition  certain of our components require an order lead time of three months or longer 
other components that currently are readily available may become more difficult to obtain in the future 
we may experience delays in the receipt of some components 
to meet forecasted production levels  we may be required to commit to long lead times for delivery from suppliers prior to receiving orders for our products 
if our forecasts exceed actual orders  we may hold large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts  which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  profitability and results of operations 
we face risks in connection with the outsourcing of the assembly of our equipment models to selected design and manufacturing companies 
in july  we announced that we have begun to engage selected design and manufacturing companies to assemble our equipment portfolio  including our invision d printers and our viper sla systems 
as of december   we had substantially completed the outsourcing of these equipment assembly activities 
in implementing and carrying out these plans  we face a number of risks  including the risk that the parties that we identify and retain to perform assembly activities may not perform in a satisfactory manner  the risk of disruption in the supply of systems to our customers if such third parties either fail to perform in a satisfactory manner or are unable to supply us with the quantity of systems that are needed to meet then current customer demand  and the risk that we face  as discussed above  in dealing with a limited number of suppliers 
we face risks associated with conducting business outside of the us  and  if we do not manage these risks  our costs may increase  our revenues from non us operations may decline  and we may suffer other adverse effects to our results of operations and financial condition 
more than of our revenue is derived from customers in countries outside of the us there are many risks inherent in business activities outside of the us that  unless managed properly  may adversely affect our profitability  including our ability to collect amounts due from customers 
our non us operations could be adversely affected by unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export controls  tariffs and other barriers  social and political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world  particularly during the summer months in europe  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  taxation  terrorism  and other factors  depending upon the country in which an opportunity arises 
our operating results vary from quarter to quarter  which could impact our stock price 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
in some quarters  it is possible that results could be below expectations of analysts and investors 
if so  the price of our common stock may decline 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  may cause these fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include acceptance and reliability of new products in the marketplace  size and timing of product shipments  fluctuations in the costs of materials and parts  currency and economic fluctuations in foreign markets and other factors affecting international sales  price competition  delays in the introduction of new products  general worldwide economic conditions  changes in the mix of products and services sold  impact of ongoing litigation  and impact of changing technologies 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by investors and securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
historically  our common stock has been characterized by generally low daily trading volume  and our common stock price has been volatile 
the price of our common stock ranged from to during factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include the perceived value of our company in the securities markets  future announcements concerning developments affecting our business or those of our competitors  including the receipt or loss of substantial orders for products  overall trends in the stock market  the impact of changes in our results of operations  our financial condition or our prospects on how we are perceived in the securities markets  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  and sales or purchases of substantial blocks of stock 
laws that inhibit takeovers and preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
various provisions of delaware law may inhibit changes in control not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock in the event of an attempted hostile takeover 
we are subject to delaware laws that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of us 
one of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date that the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  of which approximately million shares are outstanding as series b convertible preferred stock 
the board of directors is authorized to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of series of preferred stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock 
our ability to issue preferred stock gives us it flexibility concerning possible acquisitions and financings  but it could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  any preferred stock that is issued may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures and series b convertible preferred stock and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options could dilute your ownership and negatively impact the market price for our common stock 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issuable as of december  upon the conversion of convertible securities and the exercise of outstanding stock options 
our convertible subordinated debentures are convertible at any time into approximately million shares of common stock 
the series b convertible preferred stock was then convertible at any time into million shares of common stock 
approximately million shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options 
to the extent that all of our subordinated debentures and the series b convertible preferred stock are converted or our outstanding stock options are exercised  a significantly greater number of shares of our common stock will be outstanding  and the interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted 
at the same time  any conversions of such convertible securities  such as the conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures at the end of  correspondingly would reduce our subordinated debt and preferred stock obligations 
moreover  future sales of substantial amounts of our stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when we consider it to be appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and our outstanding industrial development bonds 
we seek to minimize the risk to our cash investments by investing cash in excess of our operating needs in short term  high quality instruments issued by highly credit worthy financial institutions  corporations or governments 
a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operation 
from time to time  we may use derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  collars or options  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  and  we had no such financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt and preferred stock varies with changes in interest rates and the market fluctuations for our common stock 
generally  the fair value of these fixed rate instruments will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these instruments also contain options to convert them into our common stock  and the fair value of these instruments is affected by our stock price and stock volatility 
at december   the carrying value of our total debt had declined to million from million at december  this consisted of million of fixed rate debt at december  and million of fixed rate debt at december  the principal reasons for the decline in the carrying value of our total debt at december  were the conversion at the end of of our convertible subordinated debentures into common stock and the making of the principal payments due during on our floating rate industrial development bonds 
the carrying value of our series b convertible preferred stock was million at december  and the estimated fair value of our total debt was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  this value includes  with respect to our fixed rate convertible securities  the cost of replacing these securities with borrowings at current rates and comparable maturities on the assumption that these securities will remain outstanding until their mandatory redemption dates 
the fair value of our fixed rate instruments is an estimate  which includes discounting of the outstanding balance to reflect current market rates of interest and an estimation of the value of the conversion options based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model attempts to value the options while giving effect to the term of the option  the exercise or strike price  the market price of our common stock and an estimate of the volatility of our common stock 
such changes in the fair value of our fixed rate instruments do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt or the total liquidation value of our outstanding preferred stock at maturity 
the increase in estimated fair value of our fixed rate instruments outstanding at december  is predominantly the result of a change from in to in in the interest rate used to discount the contractual payments associated with the instruments and  with respect to the value of the conversion options  an increase in the year end market price of our common stock into which the instruments are convertible from per share at december  to per share at december  this increase was partially offset by the conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures in the fourth quarter a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would result in a change in the estimated fair value of our debt at december  of million 
foreign exchange rates we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
more than of our consolidated revenue is derived from sales outside of the us this revenue is generated primarily from the operations of our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and surrounding geographic areas and is primarily denominated in each subsidiary s local functional currency although certain sales are denominated in other currencies  including us dollars or the euro  rather than the local functional currency 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in their local functional currency 
these currencies include the euro  pound sterling  swiss franc and japanese yen 
the geographic areas outside the united states in which we operate are not considered to be highly inflationary 
nonetheless  these foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currencies 
our operating results as well as our assets and liabilities are also subject to the effect of foreign currency translation when the operating results  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements

a hypothetical change in commodity prices for raw materials would cause a change of million to cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations
