the following information contains forward looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements 
general the company produces and markets fresh and frozen baked breads  rolls and snack foods 
sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions and product line extensions  marketing and service 
the company manages these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring its higher margin branded products  while using private label products to absorb overhead costs and maximize use of production capacity 
the principal elements comprising the company s production costs are ingredients  packaging materials  labor and overhead 
the major ingredients used in the production of the company s products are flour  sugar  shortening and dairy products 
the company also uses paper products  such as corrugated cardboard and plastic to package its products 
the prices of these materials are subject to significant volatility 
the company 
table of contents has mitigated the effects of such price volatility in the past through its hedging programs  but may not be successful in protecting itself from fluctuations in the future 
in addition to the foregoing factors  production costs are affected by the efficiency of production methods and capacity utilization 
the company s selling  marketing and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of distribution  logistics and promotional expenses 
distribution and logistics costs represent the largest component of the company s cost structure  other than production costs  and are principally influenced by changes in sales volume 
additionally  the independent distributors receive a percentage of the wholesale price of sales to retailers and other customers 
the company records these amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the company are comprised of depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of certain costs in excess of net tangible assets associated with acquisitions 
the company does not allocate depreciation and amortization to cost of goods sold 
critical accounting policies and estimates note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and disclosure of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
the following is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates  and the accounting policies and methods listed below used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  derivative instruments  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles  self insurance reserves  income tax expense and accruals  pension obligations  and distributor accounting 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives  at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the 
table of contents incentive 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
independent distributors receive a discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers 
the company records such amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase distributor discounts  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses at the time the discount is offered 
the consumer packaged goods industry has utilized scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
consequently  revenue is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer 
this technology is referred to in the industry as pay by scan pbs 
during  the industry saw a sharp increase in the use of scan based trading 
in response to this demand  the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs 
the company believes it is a baked foods industry leader in pbs and is aggressively working with its larger customers  such as wal mart  winn dixie  kroger and food lion  to expand the use of pbs 
in fiscal  the company recorded approximately million in sales through pbs 
the company estimates that by the end of fiscal  it will have approximately million in pbs sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from non payment by our customers 
while the company believes its current allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to the commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into forward purchase agreements and derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
the company may from time to time enter into contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under gaap 
these contracts must  under gaap  be marked to market as of the end of each quarter  which may result in significant volatility in our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  auto liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and data 
though the company does not expect them to do so  actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated 
material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
income tax expense and accruals 
the annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate 
the effect of these changes  if any  would be recognized when the change takes place 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these assessments relate to both permanent and temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimates of our current tax exposures 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance  which could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
periodically we face audits from federal and state tax authorities  which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions 
the irs has initiated audits of our tax returns as well as the returns of our predecessor  fii  for the tax years through in connection with our spin off from fii in  we agreed to remain obligated for tax liabilities arising prior to the date of the spin off 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact our ultimate payment of such exposures 
while the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not currently believe that these audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 
pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its defined benefit plan based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plan portfolio  past performance of these assets and other factors 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plan and other factors 
there are no new participants in the company s defined benefit plan as participation was frozen as of december  the company s fiscal pension expense was million 
the company expects its fiscal pension expense to be approximately million 
a quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s fiscal expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point change in the long term expected rate of return would impact the company s fiscal pension expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
the discount rate used by the company reflects rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the company has historically used rates of return on high quality fixed income investments  such as those included in the moody s aa bond index  to determine its discount rate 
the historical reference to the moody s yield is characterized as a proxy for the discount rate that would have been generated through a more rigorous cash flow matching technique 
during fiscal  the company determined it appropriate to refine the prior estimation approach to use a more rigorous cash flow matching technique to select the discount rate as the use of the moody s index as a proxy has declined 
given the current market dynamics  the company believes the cash flow matching technique provides a better estimate of the discount rate than the moody s index 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date  the company evaluates input from its investment advisors and actuaries in light of the plan assets historical actual returns and current economic conditions 
the average annual return on the plan assets for the last years is approximately net of investment expenses 
the expected long term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of equity securities  debt securities  other diversifying strategies including  but not limited to  absolute return funds  real estate  cash and other 
the company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company includes an explicit investment management expense assumption in its calculation of annual pension cost 
therefore  the return on asset rate reflects long term expected returns before investment expenses 

table of contents the company determines the fair value of substantially all its plan assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans projected benefit obligations pbo 
if the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of the larger of i the pbo or ii the market value of plan assets  the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the estimated average future service of plan participants 
the total unrealized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of september  for all of the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
an amortization of unrealized losses of million was required during fiscal the total unrealized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of september  for all of the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
these unrecognized losses are due to plan asset performance that was below expectations and actual experience that differed from the actuaries assumptions 
to the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized  then this loss will increase the company s pension costs in the future 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company contributed million  million and million  respectively  to the defined benefit plan 
the value of the company s plan assets were below the accumulated benefit obligation abo at its most recent plan measurement date 
accounting rules require that  if the abo exceeds the fair value of pension plan assets  the employer must recognize a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded abo 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment that impacted other comprehensive income by million  net of income tax 
other balance sheet accounts impacted include deferred tax assets decrease of million  unfunded pension liability decrease of million  and an intangible asset related to unrecognized prior service costs decrease of million 
future pension contributions will depend on market conditions 
on january   the company made a voluntary cash contribution of million to the pension plan 
the company does not intend to make further contributions to the pension plan during fiscal in assessing different scenarios  the company believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without affecting the business strategy of the company 
distributor accounting 
the company purchases territories from and sells territories to independent distributors from time to time 
at the time the company purchases a territory from an independent distributor  the purchase price of the territory is recorded as assets held for sale distributor routes 
upon the sale of that territory to a new independent distributor  generally a note receivable is recorded for the sales price of the territory  as the company provides direct financing to the distributor  with a corresponding credit to assets held for sale to relieve the carrying amount of the territory 
any difference between the amount of the note receivable and the territory s carrying value is recorded as a gain or a loss in selling marketing and administrative expenses because the company considers its distributor activity a cost of distribution 
in the event the sales price of the territory exceeds the carrying amount of the territory  the gain is deferred and recorded over the year life of the note receivable from the independent distributor 
in addition  since the distributor has the right to require the company to repurchase the territory at the original purchase price within the six month period following the date of sale  no gain is recorded on the sale of the territory during this six month period 
upon expiration of the six month period  the amount deferred during this period is recorded and the remaining gain on the sale is recorded over the remaining nine and one half years of the note 
in instances where a territory is sold for less than its carrying value  a loss is recorded at the date of sale 
a substantial decrease in the value of territories held for sale would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations

sale of mrs 
smith s bakeries frozen dessert business in fiscal on april   the company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of its mrs

the frozen dessert business of mrs 
smith s bakeries sold is reported as a discontinued operation 
because the mrs 
smith s bakeries frozen dessert and frozen bread and roll businesses historically shared certain administrative and division expenses  certain allocations and assumptions have been made in order to present historical comparative information 
in most instances  administrative and division expenses have been allocated between mrs 
smith s bakeries and flowers specialty based on cases of product sold 
management believes that the amounts are reasonable estimates of the costs that would have been incurred had the mrs 
smith s bakeries frozen dessert and frozen bread and rolls businesses performed these functions as separate divisions

adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on december  the first day of fiscal 
this standard provides accounting and disclosure guidance for acquired intangibles 
under this standard  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer amortized  but are tested at least annually for impairment 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce carrying value to fair value 
transitional impairment tests of goodwill and non amortized intangibles were also performed upon adoption of sfas  with any recognized impairment loss reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change at the date of adoption 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment  and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge at mrs

mrs 
smith s bakeries flowers flowers bakeries discontinued operations specialty total amounts in millions assets held and used assets abandoned system costs fixed assets total the impairment of mrs 
smith s bakeries assets held and used was based on an analysis of projected undiscounted cash flows  which were no longer deemed adequate to support the carrying value of the fixed assets

this was historically mrs 
smith s bakeries peak business period of the year 
during this peak time in fiscal  sales and operating earnings were well below projections 
therefore  based upon these factors  the analysis was performed at the end of fiscal as a result of the analysis  these fixed assets were written down to their estimated fair values  which were based primarily on values identified in the negotiations with schwan to sell certain assets of mrs 
smith s bakeries frozen dessert business 
at december   these fixed assets did not meet the held for sale criteria of sfas the impairment of systems costs represents the net book value of certain enterprise wide information system sap costs that were determined to be impaired as a result of the fiscal internal operating segment reorganization 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company converted four former mrs 
smith s bakeries production facilities from the sap version used at mrs

furthermore  pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  ebitda is used to determine the company s compliance with certain financial covenants 
the company also believes that ebitda measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because they assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation or amortization  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and non operating factors such as historical cost 
ebitda is also a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to a income from operations or net income loss as a measure of operating performance  b cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s ability to meet its cash needs  or c any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with gaap

the company uses forward  futures  swap and option contracts to hedge existing or future exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company does not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting the margins from the sale of our products 
commodity price risk the company enters into commodity forward  futures and option contracts and swap agreements for wheat and  to a lesser extent  other commodities in an effort to provide a predictable and consistent commodity price and thereby reduce the impact of volatility in its raw material and packaging prices

the interest rate swap agreements result in the company paying or receiving the difference between the fixed and floating rates at specified intervals calculated based on the notional amounts 
the interest rate differential to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change and is recorded as interest expense 
under sfas  these swap transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the swap transaction is recorded each period in other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded to current period earnings in selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
in and  interest expense was not materially impacted by periodic settlements of the swaps 
however  million of interest expense was recognized in discontinued operations during the fifty three weeks ended january  as a result of periodic settlements of the swaps
