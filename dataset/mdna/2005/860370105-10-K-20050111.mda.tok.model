item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of fiscal year we are the third largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states 
as of january   we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico 
in september  we announced a set of operating initiatives and created four task forces to address the following key areas increased cemetery property sales volume  growth in the number of funeral events performed  cost improvements and employee development 
as part of our cost reduction initiatives  in december we announced plans to restructure and reduce our workforce by approximately employees 
in fiscal year  we achieved the operating and financial goals announced in december reflecting the successful execution of our key operating initiatives 
we projected earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of 
to 
per share for fiscal year including the impact of separation charges and the impact of gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses 
we achieved earnings from continuing operations of 
per share for fiscal year including the impact of separation charges of 
per share  partially offset by gains on dispositions net of impairment losses of 
per share 
we projected cash flow from operations to be between million and million  including the tax refund received in december due to a change in the tax accounting methods for cemetery merchandise revenue 
we achieved cash flow from operations of million  including the million tax refund received in december our goal was to increase preneed sales by percent to percent in fiscal year we experienced increases of percent in both cemetery property and preneed funeral sales for the year 
our fiscal year forecast included an increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed of approximately percent to percent  excluding any impact from trust earnings 
we attained this goal with an increase in average revenue of percent per traditional service and percent per cremation service 
the upper end of our forecast range assumed flat same store funeral calls in compared to  and the lower end assumed a possible reduction in same store funeral calls of up to percent 
our same store funeral calls decreased percent 
trust earnings were assumed to be slightly down from those recognized in fiscal year our trust earnings decreased percent 
our cost reduction initiatives resulted in a million decrease in funeral  cemetery and corporate general and administrative expenses  which was in line with our expectations for the year 
we recorded charges in fiscal year for severance and other costs associated with the workforce reductions announced in december and separation payments related to a former executive officer totaling million million after tax  or 
per share 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified a number of small businesses to close or sell  most of which were acquired as part of a group of facilities  that were performing below acceptable levels or no longer fit our operating profile 
as a result  we recorded a million noncash impairment charge in fiscal year  of which million million after tax  or 
per share was included in continuing operations in the consolidated statement of earnings 
collectively  these businesses generated revenue of approximately million and very little gross profit during fiscal year the closing or sale of these businesses has enabled management to focus on our most productive operations where our operating initiatives have the potential to bring about the greatest benefits in increased earnings and cash flow 
for fiscal year  we evaluated our long lived assets  recorded impairment charges of 
million and sold several assets that were held for sale at a net gain of million 
the net effect was that we recorded gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  of 
million million after tax  or 
per share in continuing operations 
as of october   we had closed on the sale of businesses for million in proceeds 
as of january   we had closed on or had entered into agreements to sell an additional businesses for about million 
in total  we have closed on or entered into agreements to sell businesses for approximately million and have additional businesses we will continue to market 
on november   we completed the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility with a million five year revolving credit facility and a million seven year term loan b 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we will incur a charge for early extinguishment of debt of million million after tax  or 
per share to write off the remaining unamortized fees related to the prior agreement 
for additional information  see 
table of contents note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we plan to continue to evaluate our options for deployment of cash flow as opportunities arise 
in june  we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program allowing us to invest up to million in repurchases of our class a common stock 
in june  our board of directors increased the program limit by an additional million to million 
as of january   we had repurchased  shares of our class a common stock at an average price of per share 
at current stock prices  stock repurchases  debt reduction and construction of funeral homes on our cemeteries or those of unaffiliated third parties continue to be more attractive uses of our cash flow than acquisitions 
however  we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions will continue to be a good business strategy  as we enjoy important synergies and economies of scale from our infrastructure 
for a discussion of our forecasts for continuing operations in fiscal year and the principal assumptions underlying the forecasts  see the discussion under the heading forward looking statements below 
preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust fund earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings and finance charges 
we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries 
our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with sfas no 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales  preneed sales and trust earnings  see notes k  l  a  and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october  the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery services and merchandise backlog represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this represents the face value of the backlog plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the estimated build up in the face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our experience  with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years 
as of october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including earnings and losses realized to date on the funds held in trust  was approximately billion 
trust portfolio we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
because a portion of the funds we receive from preneed sales are deposited into the trusts and invested in a variety of debt and equity securities and other investments  the performance of the trusts investments can affect our current and future revenue streams 
from through  we achieved an overall annual realized return of percent to percent in our domestic trusts 
however  the average realized return on our domestic trusts was percent  percent  percent  percent and percent for fiscal years    and  respectively 
these returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
we defer recognition of all earnings and losses realized by preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts until the underlying products and services are delivered 
consequently  the lower investment returns realized during previous years reduced the trust earnings recognized as revenue in and will likely do so again in fiscal year we recognize all earnings and losses realized by our cemetery perpetual care trusts currently  including capital gains and losses in those jurisdictions where capital gains can be withdrawn and used for cemetery 
table of contents maintenance 
as a result  depressed stock prices and low returns on fixed income investments put pressure on perpetual care trust earnings recognized in fiscal year and may do so again in fiscal year because approximately percent of our total trust portfolio is currently invested in a diversified group of equity securities  we would generally expect our portfolio performance to improve if the performance of the overall stock market improves  but we would also expect its performance to deteriorate over time if the overall stock market declines 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the market value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
if we determine that an unrealized loss is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis to the current market value 
the other than temporary loss is reflected as a reduction in the value of the trust asset and a corresponding reduction in the related non controlling interest and deferred revenue liabilities and has no effect on shareholders equity 
unrealized gains and losses reflected in the tables in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements included in item are temporary as the cost basis in these tables have already been adjusted to reflect the other than temporary unrealized losses 
our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and escrow accounts had other than temporary declines of million and million  respectively  as of october   from their original cost basis 
they had net unrealized depreciation of million and million  respectively  as of october  resulting from temporary unrealized gains and losses 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item if the fair market value of the trusts were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services  we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected loss on the delivery of contracts in our backlog 
over time  gains and losses realized in the trusts are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of trust earnings to be recorded when we deliver the underlying products or services 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue we would realize when we deliver the underlying products and services 
our cemetery perpetual care trust accounts had other than temporary declines of million as of october   from their original cost basis 
they had net unrealized appreciation of million as of october  resulting from temporary unrealized gains and losses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item unrealized gains and losses in the cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts do not affect current earnings but unrealized losses could limit the capital gains available to us and could eventually result in lower returns and lower revenues than we have historically achieved from these trusts 
cash impact of preneed sales the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed sales are generally cash flow negative initially but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
cash expended for preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales  principally sales compensation  is capitalized in deferred charges on the balance sheet and amortized and expensed as cost of sales as the contracts are delivered 
overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
revenue recognition 
table of contents funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings and increasing insurance benefits  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed see note k to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of sfas no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate sfas no 

under sfas no 
 revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until a minimum percentage percent of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue associated with sales of preneed merchandise and services is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed see note l to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r 
we implemented fin r as of april   which resulted in the consolidation of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
this implementation was as of april  and only affected our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our second quarter results of operations or cash flows 
in subsequent periods  the implementation of fin r  as it relates to the consolidation of trusts  affects classifications within the balance sheet  statement of earnings and statement of cash flows  but has no effect on shareholders equity  net cash flow or the recognition and reporting of revenues or net earnings 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies after the implementation of fin r  see notes a and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for doubtful accounts management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on an analysis of historical collection and write off experience 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years and from to years  respectively  primarily using the straight line method 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review for continued appropriateness the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows 
if indicators of impairment were present  we would evaluate the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets compared to the carrying amount of those assets 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we identified a number of small businesses to close or sell in fiscal year based on our review of the carrying amount of these businesses compared to their fair value  we recorded a noncash charge of million related to the impairment of these long lived assets 
of this amount  million was included in continuing operations and million was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings 
fair value was established based on our best estimate and is subject to revision in future periods as properties are actually sold or closed 
for fiscal year  we evaluated our long lived assets  recorded impairment charges of 
million and sold several assets that we held for sale at a net gain of million 
the net effect was that we reported gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  of 
million in continuing operations 
we also recorded gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  of million in discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item valuation of goodwill in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our evaluation of goodwill for our operations is performed at the funeral and cemetery segment levels  which constitute our reporting units 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
impairment losses are recognized when the estimated fair value of goodwill associated with all of our cemeteries or funeral homes is less than their respective carrying values 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and concluded that no goodwill impairment charges were necessary 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  a noncash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the cemetery segment was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the tax benefit in of million associated with sfas no 
relates to properties that have generated tax deductible goodwill 
according to sfas no 
 deferred taxes are not recorded on properties that do not generate goodwill amortization for tax purposes 
see note h and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of sfas no 
and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value  we measure any impairment based on our estimates of current fair value compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill amounted to million as of october  and accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of long lived assets 
based on our assessment that it was not likely we would be able to realize the full million in tax benefits associated with the potential losses generated from the impairment  we determined that a million valuation allowance was appropriate 
the million valuation allowance was required because we anticipated the majority of sales would generate capital losses due to the expected nature of the sales transactions 
we believed we would likely not generate sufficient capital gains over the relevant time period against which we could offset these future capital losses given the existing capital loss carryforwards we already have available to us 
sales completed in generated primarily ordinary losses based on the type of sale transaction asset sale 
a tax benefit was recorded in for these sales 
upon completion of the asset sales  the entire book basis was removed  but there remained a tax basis in the stock of the unliquidated 
table of contents subsidiary 
therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the associated tax benefit of the remaining tax basis in these subsidiaries because it is not likely that we will realize a tax benefit upon the liquidation of the subsidiaries 
a small amount of capital losses were also realized in  and a benefit was recorded since there were sufficient capital gains in the current year available to offset these losses 
accordingly  the valuation allowance as of october  was reduced to million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item based on estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable  we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of october  except as described above relating to long lived asset impairments 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
insurance loss reserves we purchase comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductible self insured retention premium rating program 
this program results in us being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies 
historical insurance industry experience indicates some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with the types of claims covered by the program 
this is especially true due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claim  often many years 
we continually evaluate loss estimates associated with claims and losses that fall below our deductible self insured retention level related to these insurance coverages with information obtained by our primary insurer 
with respect to health insurance  we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
expected claims are based on actuarial estimates  actual claims may differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our claims experience related to this coverage with information obtained by our insurer 
assumptions used in preparing these estimates are based on factors such as claim settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness 
together these factors will generally affect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these evaluations are used to both analyze and adjust our insurance loss reserves 
the estimated reserves on the uninsured legal and employment related claims are established by management based upon the recommendations of professionals who perform a review of known claims 
these reserves include the estimated settlement costs 
although management believes estimated reserves related to uninsured claims are adequately recorded  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded reserves 
results of operations year ended october  compared to year ended october  continuing operations 
table of contents funeral segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions total funeral revenue total funeral costs total funeral gross profit funeral revenue from continuing operations was flat for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in our same store businesses achieved a percent increase in the average revenue per traditional funeral service and a percent increase in the average revenue per cremation service 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in trust earnings recognized upon the delivery of preneed funerals  resulting from lower investment returns realized in our preneed funeral trusts during previous years  and by an increase in the proportion of non traditional funerals  including cremations 
this resulted in an overall percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service for our same store businesses 
that increase was offset by a percent decline in the number of funeral services performed by our same store businesses  or events out of the  total same store events performed 
we believe a number of factors contributed to the increases in our average revenue per traditional and cremation service 
we believe the primary factors were normal inflationary price increases  more effective merchandising and packaging  our focus on training  customized funeral planning and personalization and a new program for arranger incentives 
funeral gross profit margin from continuing operations increased from percent in the year ended october  to percent in the year ended october  this improvement was due primarily to reduced general and administrative costs in the funeral segment resulting from our cost reduction initiatives as discussed in business strategy included in item although we intend to continue to control costs  we do not expect further significant cost cuts  and therefore we expect our funeral gross profit margin from continuing operations to stabilize in fiscal year see forward looking statements and cautionary statements 
the cremation rate for our same store operations was percent for the year ended october  compared to percent for the year ended october  cemetery segment year ended october  increase in millions total cemetery revenue total cemetery costs total cemetery gross profit cemetery revenue from continuing operations increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in  primarily due to an increase in cemetery property sales  construction during the year on various cemetery development projects and an improvement in our bad debt experience 
our sales organization has been very successful with our preneed cemetery property sales initiative 
cemetery property sales increased percent for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   which was in line with our stated goal of percent to percent 
this increase in cemetery property sales accounted for approximately half of the cemetery revenue increase with the remaining increase due primarily to progress on the construction of various cemetery property sold prior to construction and the improvement in our bad debt experience 
revenue related to the sale of cemetery property prior to its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting as construction occurs 
we experienced an annualized average return  excluding unrealized gains and losses  of percent in our perpetual care trusts for the year ended october  resulting in revenue of million  compared to percent for the corresponding period in resulting in revenue of million 
cemetery gross profit margin from continuing operations increased from percent in the year ended october  to percent in the year ended october  this improvement resulted from increased cemetery revenue as discussed above  combined with reduced general and administrative costs in the cemetery segment resulting primarily from our cost reduction initiatives as discussed in business strategy included in item although we intend to continue to control costs  we do not expect further significant cost cuts  and therefore we expect our cemetery gross profit margin from continuing operations to stabilize in fiscal year see forward looking statements and cautionary statements 

table of contents discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
in december  we announced plans to close or sell a number of small businesses  primarily small funeral homes  most of which were acquired as part of a group of facilities  that were performing below acceptable levels or no longer fit our operating profile 
the operating results of those businesses that met the discontinued operations criteria in sfas no

investment and other income expense  net  decreased million to an expense of

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
preneed sales into and deliveries out of the backlog in the third quarter of fiscal year  we increased our focus on preneed sales as part of our operating initiatives  and that effort helped us achieve a percent increase in preneed funeral sales for the year ended october  compared to the same period in the revenues from our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales are deferred into our backlog and are not included in our operating results presented above 
we added million in preneed sales to our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog including million related to insurance funded preneed funeral contracts during the year ended october  to be recognized in the future net of cancellations as these prepaid products and services are delivered  compared to million including million related to insurance funded preneed funeral contracts for the corresponding period in deliveries out of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog  including accumulated trust earnings related to these preneed deliveries  amounted to million for the year ended october   compared to million for the corresponding period in  resulting in net reductions in the backlog of million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  continuing operations funeral segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions domestic operations funeral revenue funeral costs 
table of contents year ended october  increase decrease in millions funeral gross profit foreign operations funeral revenue funeral costs funeral gross profit total funeral revenue total funeral costs total funeral gross profit funeral revenue from continuing operations decreased million for the year ended october  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to a decrease in revenue resulting from the completion of the sale of our foreign operations in the decline is also due to a reduction in the number of domestic funeral services performed coupled with a reduction in trust earnings recognized upon the delivery of preneed funerals 
the reduction in trust earnings resulted from lower investment returns realized in our preneed funeral trust funds during previous years 
we experienced a percent decline  events in the number of funeral services performed by our same store businesses  partially offset by a percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed by these businesses 
we track our at need sales by market and regularly compare our performance with data from a variety of sources to gauge changes in market share 
our analysis of this data indicates to us that approximately percent of the decline in the number of funeral services performed was due to a decline in the number of deaths in our markets for fiscal year and approximately percent of the decline was due to a loss in market share 
funeral gross profit margin from domestic continuing operations decreased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in the decline is primarily due to an increase in insurance costs coupled with the reduction in funeral revenue as discussed above 
the cremation rate for our same store operations was percent for the year ended october  compared to percent for the corresponding period in cemetery segment year ended october  increase decrease in millions domestic operations cemetery revenue cemetery costs cemetery gross profit foreign operations cemetery revenue cemetery costs cemetery gross profit total cemetery revenue total cemetery costs total cemetery gross profit cemetery revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to a decline in merchandise deliveries  reduced perpetual care trust earnings and the completion of the sale of our foreign operations in we believe the decline in merchandise deliveries during the year ended october  is due primarily to the fact that the merchandise delivered during fiscal year had a lower average value than the merchandise delivered during the comparable period in the decline in merchandise deliveries during fiscal year is also due in part to the decrease in the number of deaths in our markets in recent prior periods 
cemetery merchandise revenue is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered and installed 
typically  installation of cemetery merchandise occurs several months after the burial occurs 
thus  a decline in the number of deaths in one quarter can cause a 
table of contents decline in cemetery merchandise deliveries in subsequent quarters 
we experienced an annualized average return  excluding unrealized gains and losses  of percent in our perpetual care trusts for the year ended october  resulting in revenue of million  compared to percent for the corresponding period in resulting in revenue of million 
cemetery gross profit margin from domestic continuing operations decreased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in the decline is due to increased insurance costs coupled with the reduction in cemetery revenue as discussed above

we had determined that the carrying value of these businesses exceeded their fair market value and recorded a noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of million related to the impairment of these long lived assets  of which million is included in continuing operations and million is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings 
fair value was established based on our best estimate and is subject to revision in future periods as properties are actually closed or sold 
revenues for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the charge related to continuing operations is presented in the gains on dispositions and impairment losses  net line item in the consolidated statement of earnings 
other primarily as a result of the significant devaluation of the argentine peso and the depressed economic conditions in argentina  we re evaluated the expected loss on the disposition of the assets held for sale and recorded a noncash charge of million in fiscal year  which is reflected in the gains on dispositions and impairment losses  net line item in the consolidated statement of earnings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year our evaluation of goodwill is performed at the funeral and cemetery segments  which constitute our reporting units 
as a result  a noncash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the cemetery segment was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in calculating the goodwill impairment charge  the fair value of the funeral and cemetery segments was determined with assistance from an independent valuation advisor using a combination of the comparable company approach and discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
for additional information on goodwill  see notes h and to the consolidated financial statements included in item we recorded charges of million for the year ended october  for separation pay related to former executive officers 
these charges are presented in the separation charges line item in the consolidated statements of earnings 
corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  increased 
million compared to the same period in the increase is due to increased legal fees and increased expenses related to the stewart enterprises  inc supplemental executive retirement plan the serp 
the serp  which became effective april   provides retirement benefits to certain executive officers that are intended to supplement the benefits available under our k plan and in part replace other benefits previously available under the executive officers employment agreements 
depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in the decrease is due to the sale of our remaining foreign operations in fiscal year interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in the decrease is due to a million decrease in the average debt 
table of contents outstanding during the fiscal year ended october   partially offset by an approximate basis point increase in our average interest rate 
other operating income  net  decreased from million for the year ended october  to million in the year ended october  and includes net gains on the sale of assets which were not included in our businesses classified as held for sale 
investment and other income  net  was 
million for the year ended october  the effective tax rate for our continuing operations for the year ended october  was percent compared to percent for the year ended october  the effective tax rate was lower than the effective tax rate due to the million goodwill impairment charge  of which a significant portion was non deductible for tax purposes 
as of october   our outstanding debt totaled million 
on may   we exercised our right to redeem our outstanding million roars rather than allowing them to be remarketed and recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
in order to redeem the roars  we used million of additional term loan b financing and million from our revolving credit facility 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of the total amount of debt outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreements in effect as of october   approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to short term variable interest rates averaging approximately percent 
in order to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt  effective march   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  expiring on march  and march   each involving a notional amount of million 
the agreements effectively convert variable rate debt bearing interest based on three month libor plus the applicable margin specified under our senior secured credit facility to fixed rate debt bearing interest at the fixed swap rate plus such applicable margin 
as of october   the effective rate of the debt hedged by the interest rate swaps was percent and percent on each million swapped 
preneed sales and deliveries the revenues from our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales are deferred into our backlog and are not included in our operating results above 
we added million in preneed sales to our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog during the year ended october  to be recognized in the future  net of cancellations  as these prepaid products and services are delivered  compared to million for the corresponding period in deliveries out of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog  including accumulated trust fund earnings related to these preneed deliveries  amounted to million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  resulting in net reductions in the backlog of million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our operations provided cash of million for the year ended october  compared to million for the comparable period in the amount included a million tax refund received during the first quarter of resulting from a change in tax accounting methods for cemetery merchandise revenue and a cash outflow of million for separation pay 
the amount included a million tax refund received related to the sale of our foreign operations and a cash outflow of 
million for separation pay 
the increase in operating cash flow was also due in part to the increase in earnings 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of 
million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for fiscal year the change was primarily due to million in proceeds from asset sales in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year 
table of contents our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in the change was due primarily to repayments of long term debt of million in fiscal year compared to net repayments of million million in repayments  net of million in proceeds in fiscal year we used the million tax refund included in operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding term loan b in the first quarter of fiscal year the million in proceeds from long term debt received in and the million paid in to avoid a remarketing right were incurred in connection with the redemption of our million remarketable or redeemable securities 
we also used million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments on november   we refinanced our senior secured credit facility with an amended and restated million senior secured credit facility 
the new facility consists of a five year million revolving credit facility and a seven year million term loan b 
as a result of the refinancing  the leverage based grid pricing for the interest rate on our revolving credit facility was reduced to libor plus basis points at closing  representing a basis point reduction  and the interest rate on our term loan b was reduced to libor plus basis points  which is basis points below the prior agreement 
the new facility has substantially the same collateral and guarantees as the prior agreement and is subject to similar but somewhat less restrictive financial and other covenants 
the term loan b matures on november  with percent of the principal due in  and the revolving credit facility matures on november   although they both will terminate six months prior to the maturity date of our percent senior subordinated notes due july  unless at least percent of the principal amount of those notes are refinanced prior to that time 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we will incur a charge for early extinguishment of debt of million million after tax  or 
per share to write off the remaining fees on the prior facility 
the fees incurred for the new facility will be approximately million and will be amortized over the life of the new debt 
for additional information on the refinancing  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item as of october  and january   our outstanding debt balance totaled million and million  respectively

we have entered into non competition agreements with prior owners and key employees of acquired subsidiaries that expire at various times through during fiscal year  we decided to relieve some of the prior owners and key employees of their obligations not to compete  however  we will continue to make the payments in accordance with the contract terms 
this category also includes separation pay related to three former executive officers 

table of contents we expect to be able to reduce our debt with approximately million of remaining income tax benefits related to the sale of our foreign operations which we expect to receive by the end of fiscal year as of october   our revolving credit facility was set to mature in june of  and our term loan b debt was set to mature in october of as described above  on november   we refinanced our senior secured credit facility with a five year million revolving credit facility and a seven year million term loan b

we substituted a bond to guarantee performance under certain preneed funeral contracts and agreed to maintain unused credit facilities in an amount that will equal or exceed the bond amount 
as of october   the balance of the florida bond was million 
we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover our estimated cost of providing the related prearranged services and products in the future 
as of october   there was million drawn on our million revolving credit facility 
as of january   there was million drawn on our new million revolving credit facility 
as of october  and january   our availability under the revolving credit facility  after giving consideration to the aforementioned letters of credit and bond obligation  was million and million  respectively 
the first call date on our senior subordinated notes is in july at a price of percent of the notes principal amount 
if we call these notes at that time  we would record a charge of early extinguishment of debt of approximately million including the call premium of million and write off of the unamortized fees of million 
as the senior subordinated notes represent over percent of our total debt outstanding  the call right may present a significant opportunity to refinance this debt at more attractive interest rates 
we may also decide to tender for these notes prior to their call date  and if we do so  we could pay a premium larger than the call premium 
additionally  the write off of the unamortized fees would be higher  and we would incur significant transaction expenses 
our ability to refinance our senior subordinated notes will depend primarily on the condition of us financial markets and our credit profile at the time of refinancing 
because we have limited control over our credit profile and no control over the condition of financial markets  there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully refinance this debt 
capital expenditures for fiscal year  capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures and million for new growth initiatives 
for fiscal year  we anticipate maintenance capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million and new growth initiatives of up to million  including the construction of the los angeles funeral homes 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures in fiscal year other than approximately million related to the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements as of october  consist of the following two items 
table of contents the million bond we are required to maintain to guarantee our obligations relating to funds we withdrew from our preneed funeral trusts in florida  which is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  and the insurance funded preneed funeral contracts  which will be funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers  are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item ratio of earnings to fixed charges our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was as follows years ended october  pretax earnings for fiscal year include charges of million for severance and other costs relating to the workforce reductions announced in december and separation payments to a former executive officer and

the financial forecasts included in this form k have been prepared by  and are the responsibility of  our management 
pricewaterhousecoopers llp has neither examined or compiled the financial forecasts and  accordingly  pricewaterhousecoopers llp does not express an opinion or other form of assurance with respect thereto 
the pricewaterhousecoopers llp report included in this form k relates to our historical financial information 
it does not extend to the forcasted information and should not be read to do so 
accuracy of the forecasts is dependent upon assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments 
the forecasts are based on a variety of estimates and assumptions made by our management with respect to  among other things  industry performance  general economic  market  industry and interest rate conditions  preneed and at need sales activities and trends  fluctuations in cost of goods sold and other expenses  capital expenditures  and other matters that cannot be accurately predicted  may not be realized and are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the forecasts will prove accurate  and actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forecasts 
for these reasons  the forecasts should not be regarded as an accurate prediction of future results  but only of results that may be obtained if substantially all of our principal expectations are realized 
we caution readers that we assume no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
we forecast that earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 
to 
per share including two early extinguishment of debt charges estimated to total 
per share 
in the first quarter of  we will incur a charge of 
per share for early extinguishment of debt resulting from the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility in november the forecast also includes a potential early extinguishment of debt charge of 
per share that we may incur if we choose to call our percent senior subordinated notes in fiscal year see liquidity and capital resources 
we cannot assure that we will call the senior subordinated notes in fiscal year  but we currently expect to do so  although it is also possible that we will tender for them earlier than their first call date at an estimated cost greater than what we have included in our forecast or that we will defer the call until a later date 
our forecasts include the projected interest savings resulting from both of these refinancings 
we expect cash flow from operations in fiscal year to be between million and million 
maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be between million and million 
our forecast for continuing operations is based on the following principal assumptions we have assumed that average revenue per traditional and cremation funeral service performed will increase by about percent to percent  excluding any impact from funeral trust earnings 
increases in average revenue per funeral service performed may be partially offset by a decrease in the number of families served by continuing operations in as compared to the upper end of the forecast range 
table of contents assumes that we will serve the same number of families during fiscal year as in  and the lower end assumes a reduction in the number of families served of up to percent 
we have assumed that cemetery property sales will increase by percent to percent 
we have assumed that total revenue from trust earnings  including earnings recognition from funeral  cemetery and perpetual care trusts  will decline from that recognized in while we intend to control costs and grow revenues  we are not assuming further significant cost cuts  and we are assuming that margins will stabilize in as a result of refinancing our senior secured credit facility in november and the opportunity to call and refinance our percent notes in july  combined with our assumption that we will be able to continue to reduce our debt  we are assuming that interest expense will decrease significantly for fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal year  we will record a charge for early extinguishment of debt of million to write off the remaining unamortized book value of fees on the prior credit agreement 
if we call our percent senior subordinated notes in july of  we would incur a charge for early extinguishment of debt of approximately million representing million for the call premium and million to write off the remaining unamortized fees on the notes 
we are assuming that cash flow for fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year with the exception of unusual items such as the tax refund of million received during fiscal year we expect to use cash flow from operations to maintain our facilities at a level comparable to  to reduce debt  to pay costs that may be incurred to refinance our percent senior subordinated notes  for stock repurchases or for growth initiatives as appropriate 
these forecasts for continuing operations exclude the results of a number of small businesses that we have decided to close or sell  the results of which will be reported separately as discontinued operations as appropriate in future reports 
cautionary statements we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business our ability to increase funeral call volume is influenced by many factors such as the number of deaths and competition in our markets  our ability to identify changing consumer preferences and various other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we have experienced declines in same store funeral call volumes for a number of years 
one of the operating initiatives announced in was the creation of a funeral call volume task force  which is using the most successful tactics of our top performing funeral homes to develop strategies to drive funeral call growth throughout our organization with an increased focus on preneed funeral sales 
nevertheless  we experienced a decline in funeral call volumes for the year ended october  we can give no assurance that we will be successful in implementing this operating initiative in the long term 
we discuss the risk of declining deaths  intense competition and our ability to identify changing consumer preferences in other risk factors herein 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products including  in recent years  internet providers 
from time to time  this price competition has resulted in losing market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and the backlog and potentially impact our annual goodwill impairment analysis 

table of contents discount retailers have begun marketing caskets at prices sometimes lower than what we offer 
consumers can now buy caskets in funeral supply stores and directly from manufacturers  as well as over the internet  and recently  the first large general merchandise company has entered the market for low cost caskets 
this could cause sales of caskets at our facilities to decrease  which could adversely affect funeral revenues and margins 
increased advertising or better marketing by competitors  or increased activity by competitors offering products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs in order to retain or recapture our market share 
in recent years  the marketing of preneed funeral services through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to increase marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs in response to competition in order to vary the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
earnings from and principal of trusts and escrow accounts could be reduced by changes in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates or by a decline in the size of the funds 
we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
earnings and investment gains and losses on trusts and escrow accounts are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
earnings are also affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities that we choose to maintain in the trusts  and we may not choose the optimal mix for any particular market condition 
the size of the trusts depends upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of ordinary income and investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
declines in earnings from cemetery perpetual care trusts would cause a decline in current revenues  while declines in earnings from other trusts and escrow accounts could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenues 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
unrealized gains and losses in the preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the trusts were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected losses on the delivery of the associated contract 
over time  gains and losses realized in the trusts are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of the trust earnings we record when we deliver the underlying products or services 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  the trusts may eventually realize losses  and our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue when we deliver the underlying products and services 
this factor adversely affected our results in fiscal year and will likely do so again in fiscal year unrealized gains and losses in the cemetery perpetual care trusts do not affect earnings but could limit the capital gains available to us and could result in lower returns and lower current revenues than we have historically achieved 
increased costs may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
while we intend to control costs and grow revenues  we do not anticipate any further significant cost cuts and expect margins to stabilize in we may not be successful in maintaining our margins and may incur additional costs 
insurance costs  in particular  have increased substantially in recent years 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  and related subsequent events have resulted in higher insurance premiums 
the volume of claims made in such a short span of time resulted in liquidity challenges that many insurers have passed on to their policyholders 
additionally  insurers have increased premiums to offset losses in equity markets due to recent economic conditions 
while we do not expect a significant increase in our insurance costs for  additional increases in insurance costs cannot be predicted 

table of contents we may experience declines in preneed sales due to numerous factors  including changes made to contract terms and sales force compensation and a weakening economy 
declines in preneed property sales would reduce current revenue 
declines in preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales would reduce our backlog and could reduce our future market share 
in an effort to increase cash flow  we modified our preneed sales strategies early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
later in fiscal year  we changed the compensation structure for our preneed sales force 
these changes  and the accompanying sales force attrition and adverse impact on sales force morale  caused preneed sales to decline 
although we do not anticipate making further significant changes in these areas  we may decide that further adjustments are advisable  which could cause additional declines in preneed sales 
in addition  a weakening economy that causes customers to reduce discretionary spending could cause  and we believe has caused in the past  a decline in preneed sales 
geopolitical concerns could lower consumer confidence  which could also result in a decline in preneed sales 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales would reduce current revenue  and declines in other preneed sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share 
one of the operating initiatives announced in was the creation of a preneed sales task force  which is strategically targeting cemeteries and funeral businesses with maximum preneed sales potential and developing specific plans to increase preneed sales and attract new customers at each of the targeted locations 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these operating initiatives 
our ability to dispose of our businesses held for sale at prices consistent with our expectations depends on several factors  many of which are beyond our control 
any changes in expected sales prices or carrying values of these businesses could result in additional impairment charges or could adversely affect our ability to sell these businesses at prices we are willing to accept 
in december  we announced plans to close or sell a number of small businesses  primarily small funeral homes  most of which were acquired as part of a group of facilities  that were performing below acceptable levels or no longer fit our operating profile 
we believe that the closing or sale of those businesses will enable management to focus on our most productive operations where our operating initiatives may bring about the greatest benefits in increased revenues 
as of january   we had closed on or entered into agreements to sell businesses for approximately million and have additional businesses we will continue to market 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these businesses or that buyers will accept our terms  nor can we give any assurance that the selling prices of these businesses will not be materially different from our expectations 
any variance between the anticipated and actual sale prices or changes in the carrying values of these businesses would result in additional impairment charges in the future and did result in gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  recorded in our public shareholders may have limited ability to influence the outcome of matters presented to them for a vote due to the significant percentage of our total voting power held by our chairman emeritus 
as of january   our chairman emeritus  frank b 
stewart  jr  held  shares or approximately percent of our outstanding class a common stock and all of the  outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
because each share of class b common stock is entitled to votes on all matters presented for a vote by our shareholders  mr 
stewart controls approximately percent of our total voting power  while holding approximately percent of our outstanding equity 
accordingly  mr 
stewart may have a significant and disproportionate influence over the election of directors and other matters requiring the affirmative vote of our shareholders 
additionally  because louisiana law and our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of two thirds of the voting power present to approve certain major transactions and any amendments to our articles of incorporation  mr 
stewart may have the ability to prevent the consummation of such actions  even if they are recommended by our board of directors and favored by a substantial majority of our shareholders 
our ability to service our debt in the future and our ability to call our senior subordinated notes in depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations or refinancings  which depends upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to service our debt depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash 
we may use substantially all of the remaining proceeds from assets and businesses held for sale of approximately million to million and the approximate million of remaining income tax benefits relating to the sale of our foreign operations  which we 
table of contents expect to receive by the end of fiscal year  to reduce our debt 
we discuss the risks associated with the sale of the businesses held for sale in other risk factors herein 
our ability to receive the expected income tax benefits within our expected time frame depends upon  among other things  the rate at which we realize additional capital gains 
our primary tax planning strategy is to produce these capital gains in our trust funds 
our ability to generate capital gains could be affected by a decline in market conditions 
our ability to generate cash flows from operations depends upon  among other things  the number of deaths in our markets  competition  the level of preneed sales and their maturities  our ability to control our costs  stock and bond market conditions  and general economic  financial and regulatory factors  most of which are beyond our control 
on november   we completed the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility 
we expect to be able to pay our remaining debt coming due in fiscal year using cash from operations 
it is not our intention to pay all remaining amounts on our long term debt exclusively from cash flow from operations 
the first call date on our senior subordinated notes is in july at a price of percent of the notes principal amount 
if we call these notes at that time  we would record a charge for early extinguishment of debt of approximately million including the call premium of million and the write off of unamortized fees of million 
as the senior subordinated notes represent approximately percent of our total debt outstanding  the call right may present a significant opportunity to refinance this debt at more attractive interest rates 
we may also decide to tender for these notes prior to their call date  and if we do so  we could pay a premium larger than the call premium 
additionally  the write off of the unamortized fees would be higher  and we would incur significant transaction expenses 
our ability to refinance our senior subordinated notes will depend primarily on the condition of us financial markets and our credit profile at the time of refinancing 
because we have limited control over our credit profile and no control over the condition of financial markets  there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully refinance this debt in increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on cash flow 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions and other costs to acquire the sale  the portion of the sales proceeds required to be placed into trusts or escrow accounts and the terms of the particular contract  such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
in fiscal year  we changed the terms and conditions of preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated our preneed sales effort in order to reduce the initial negative impact on cash flow 
nevertheless  we will continue to invest a significant portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow would be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on our variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
as of january   million of our long term debt was subject to variable interest rates 
accordingly  any significant increase in interest rates could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt or indebtedness incurred in the future  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share materially 
covenant restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated note indenture limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain  among other things  covenants that restrict us and our subsidiary guarantors ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
they limit  among other things  our and our subsidiary guarantors ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate specified asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  and create liens on assets 
in addition  the senior secured credit facility contains specific limits on capital expenditures and the prepayment of debt other than that incurred under the senior secured credit facility and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
these covenants may require us to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
in addition  events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default  allowing the lenders to declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable 

table of contents our projections for do not include any earnings from acquisition activity 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
our projections for do not include any earnings from acquisition activity 
although acquisitions were the principal component in our growth strategy in the s  we have not made any significant acquisitions in recent years  as conditions for acquisitions have not been favorable 
we may not be able to find businesses for sale at prices we are willing to pay 
acquisition activity  if any  will also depend on our ability to enter new markets 
due in part to our lack of experience operating in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than we have  such entry may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting  which could impact the market price of our common stock and our access to capital 
we are in the process of completing our documentation and beginning the testing of our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires management s assessments of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a report by our independent auditors addressing management s assessments and the effectiveness of the internal controls as of that date 
during the course of testing  we may identify deficiencies and weaknesses  which we believe that our current plan will give us the ability to be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section the timing of the identification of any deficiencies or weaknesses could cause management to be unable to conclude that our internal controls are effective as of the end of fiscal year or our auditors to be unable to give a favorable report on management s assessments 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and possibly on our access to capital 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline  which could decrease revenues 
this factor adversely affected our results in fiscal year and could do so again in fiscal year although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths 
changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
however  generally the number of deaths fluctuates with the seasons with more deaths occurring during the winter months primarily resulting from pneumonia and influenza 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc from time to time may not necessarily be meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
the increasing number of cremations in the united states could cause revenues to decline because we could lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lesser funeral revenues and  in certain cases  lesser profit margins than traditional funerals 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of the deaths in the united states by the year  compared to percent in the trend toward cremation could cause cemeteries and traditional funeral homes to lose market share and revenues to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations with no funeral 
table of contents service  casket  urn  mausoleum niche  columbarium niche or burial produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues than traditional funerals and  when delivered at a traditional funeral home  produce lower profit margins as well 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
during fiscal year  we began to implement strategies based on a proprietary  extensive study of consumer preferences we commissioned in however  we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
funeral homes and cemetery businesses must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the federal trade commission  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
several states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations  our cash flows and our future prospects

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in the prices of marketable equity securities and interest rates as discussed below 
generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions are characterized as other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in equity markets or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur  and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur 
actual gains and losses  fluctuations in equity markets  interest rates and the timing of transactions  may differ from those estimated 
marketable equity securities as of october  and  our marketable equity securities subject to market risk consisted principally of investments held by our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts and had fair values of million and million  respectively  which were determined using final sale prices quoted on stock exchanges 
each percent change in the average market prices 
table of contents of the equity securities held in such accounts would result in a change of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of such accounts 
our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts  all of which are managed by iti  are detailed in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included in item iti operates pursuant to a formal investment policy as discussed in operations included in item interest we have entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations  which are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item as of october  and  the carrying values of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  were approximately million and million  respectively  compared to fair values of million and million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices 
each approximate percent change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt  and basis points for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately 
million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
if these instruments are held to maturity  no change in fair value will be realized 
in order to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt  effective march   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  each involving a notional amount of million 
the first agreement effectively converted million of variable rate debt bearing interest based on three month libor to a fixed rate based on the swap rate of percent and expired on march  the second agreement effectively converts million of variable rate debt bearing interest based on three month libor to a fixed rate based on the swap rate of percent and expires on march  the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps based on quoted market prices was 
million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in an increase of approximately 
million and 
million in the fair value of these instruments as of october  and october   respectively 
as a result of the debt refinancing that took place in november  none of our debt is hedged by the remaining interest rate swap 
as of october  and  the carrying values of our term loan b and revolving credit facility were million and million  respectively  compared to fair values of million and million  respectively 
of the million outstanding under term loan b and the revolving credit facility on october   million was not hedged by the interest rate swap and was subject to short term variable interest rates 
each approximate percent  or basis point  change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately 
million in our pretax earnings 
of the million outstanding under term loan b and the revolving credit facility on october   million was not hedged by the interest rate swaps in effect and was subject to short term variable interest rates 
each approximate percent  or basis point  change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately 
million in our pretax earnings 
fair value was determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flows discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
we monitor our mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate senior secured credit facility with fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swaps 
as of october  and  our fixed income securities subject to market risk consisted principally of investments in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts and had aggregate quoted market values of million and million  respectively 
each percent change in interest rates on these fixed income securities would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of such securities based on discounted expected future cash flows 
if these securities are held to maturity  no change in fair value will be realized 
as of october  and  our money market and other short term investments subject to market risk  including amounts held in preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts  and in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  had carrying values approximating their fair values of million and million  respectively 
under our current accounting methods  a change in the average interest rate earned by our preneed 
table of contents funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts would not result in a change in our current pretax earnings 
as such  as of october  and  only million and million  respectively  of these short term investments  which includes amounts in the cemetery perpetual care trusts and other short term investments not held in trust  were subject to changes in interest rates 
each percent change in average interest rates applicable to such investments  basis points for and would result in a change of less than 
million for and a change of approximately 
million for in our pretax earnings 
the fixed income securities  money market and other short term investments owned by us are principally invested in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts  which are managed by iti 
iti operates pursuant to a formal investment policy as discussed above 
trusts as of october   our marketable equity securities and fixed income securities subject to market risk consisted principally of investments held by our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts 
we estimate that each basis point increase or decrease in the yield  which excludes unrealized gains and losses  on the preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and the cemetery perpetual care trusts  based on october  balances  would result in an approximate increase or decrease in our revenues associated with the delivery of prearranged products and services and the earnings from the cemetery perpetual care trusts of million in  million in and million in
