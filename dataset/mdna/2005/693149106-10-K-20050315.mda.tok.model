item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview the company s administrative headquarters are in tontitown  arkansas 
from this location we manage operations conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries based in various locations around the united states and canada 
the operations of these subsidiaries can generally be classified into either truckload services or brokerage and logistics services 
truckload services include those transportation services in which we utilize company owned tractors or owner operator owned tractors 
brokerage and logistics services consist of services such as transportation scheduling  routing  mode selection  transloading and other value added services related to the transportation of freight which may or may not involve the usage of company owned or owner operator owned equipment 
both our truckload operations and our brokerage logistics operations have similar economic characteristics and are impacted by virtually the same economic factors as discussed elsewhere in this report 
all of the company s operations are in the motor carrier segment 
for both operations  substantially all of our revenue is generated by transporting freight for customers and is predominantly affected by the rates per mile received from our customers  equipment utilization  and our percentage of non compensated miles 
these aspects of our business are carefully managed and efforts are continuously underway to achieve favorable results 
truckload services revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  represented   and of total revenues  excluding fuel surcharges for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are costs incurred in transporting freight for our customers 
currently our most challenging costs include fuel  driver recruitment  training  wage and benefit costs  independent broker costs which we record as purchased transportation  insurance  and maintenance and capital equipment costs 
in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge  and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue allows a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
during  and  approximately million  million and million of the company s total revenue was generated from fuel surcharges 
we also discuss certain changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the high variable cost nature of certain expenses makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
results of operations truckload services the following table sets forth  for truckload services  the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  for the periods indicated 
operating supplies expense  which includes fuel costs  are shown net of fuel surcharges 
years ended december  operating revenues  before fuel surcharge operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits operating supplies  net of fuel surcharge rent and purchased transportation depreciation and amortization operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communications and utilities other loss on sale or disposal of property total operating expenses operating income non operating income interest expense income before income taxes compared to for the year ended december   truckload services revenue  before fuel surcharges  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  approximately million of the million increase was attributable to the mcneill trucking  inc asset acquisition which closed on april  and therefore had no comparable revenue for the first three months of the remaining increase was due to an increase in the average rate per total mile charged to customers from during to during salaries  wages and benefits decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease relates to the effect of a higher average rate per mile charged to customers without a corresponding increase in salaries and wages 
however  effective october  a driver pay increase of approximately 
per mile was implemented which began to partially offset the benefit of recent rate increases charged to customers 
driver lease expense which is a component of salaries  wages and benefits  also decreased during as the average number of owner operators under contract decreased from during to during this decrease in driver lease expense was partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to the corresponding company driver replacement  and in other costs normally absorbed by the owner operator such as repairs and fuel 
also contributing to the decrease in salaries  wages and benefits was the continued benefit of the restructuring of workers compensation plans which resulted in a decrease in amounts expensed for workers compensation coverage 
operating supplies and expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs resulting from a increase in the average price per gallon paid by the company during as compared to during periods of rising fuel prices the company is often able to recoup at least a portion of the increase through fuel surcharges passed along to its customers 
fuel costs  net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in from million in the company collected approximately million in fuel surcharges during and million during fuel costs were also affected by the replacement of owner operators with company drivers as discussed above 
also contributing to the increase in operating supplies and expenses were increased costs associated with our student training program as the number of students increased during as compared to rent and purchased transportation increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates primarily to rental and mileage fees incurred on equipment used past scheduled trade in dates due to manufacturers delays in providing replacement equipment 
depreciation and amortization increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to the combined effect of higher tractor purchase prices and lower tractor guaranteed residual values offered by manufacturers 
insurance and claims expense increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase in expense relates to the purchase of additional auto liability coverage which was not in place during and to an increase in the amount of auto liability claims incurred by the company 
other expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates to an increase in amounts paid for both driver recruitment advertising and fees paid to the company s external auditors both of which were partially offset by the settlement of a lawsuit which allowed the company to recapture approximately  of previously reported expense 
the recapture contributed approximately 
to both diluted and basic earnings per share 
the truckload services division operating ratio  which measures the ratio of operating expenses  net of fuel surcharges  to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  increased to for from for compared to for the year ended december   truckload services revenue  before fuel surcharges  increased to million from million for the year ended december  during the company completed the asset acquisition of mcneill trucking  inc which provided additional truckload services revenue of approximately as compared to  however decreases in equipment utilization during partially offset the additional revenue generated as a result of the acquisition 
this decrease in equipment utilization resulted in a decrease in average truckload revenue  before fuel surcharges  generated per tractor each work day from in to in salaries  wages and benefits increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with the company s health insurance and workers compensation benefit plans 
the costs associated with these benefit plans increased from million during to million during also during  amounts accrued for incentive bonus plans were decreased as compared to which helped to partially offset the increase in health insurance and workers compensation expense 
operating supplies and expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs resulting from a increase in the average price per gallon paid by the company during as compared to during periods of rising fuel prices the company is often able to recoup at least a portion of the increase through fuel surcharges passed along to its customers 
fuel costs  net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in from million in the company collected approximately million in fuel surcharges during and million during also contributing to the increase in operating supplies and expenses were increased equipment maintenance costs associated with trade units in order to meet equipment condition trade terms as specified by the equipment manufacturer 
depreciation and amortization increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to the combined effect of higher tractor purchase prices and lower tractor guaranteed residual values offered by manufacturers 
results of operations logistics and brokerage services the following table sets forth  for logistics and brokerage services  the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  for the periods indicated 
brokerage service operations occur specifically in certain divisions  however  brokerage operations occur throughout the company in similar operations having substantially similar economic characteristics 
rent and purchased transportation  which includes costs paid to third party carriers  are shown net of fuel surcharges 
years ended december  operating revenues  before fuel surcharge operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits operating supplies  net of fuel surcharge rent and purchased transportation depreciation and amortization operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communications and utilities other loss on sale or disposal of property total operating expenses operating income non operating income interest expense income before income taxes compared to logistics and brokerage services revenues  before fuel surcharges  increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to the additional one month revenues  before fuel surcharges  for  generated by east coast transport  inc which was acquired january  salaries  wages and benefits increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates to the hiring of an administrative staff at east coast transport  llc for functions which had previously been outsourced to a third party and to an increase in corporate general and administrative salaries being allocated to the division 
rent and purchased transportation decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease reflects the change attributable to higher rates collected from customers without a corresponding increase in cost 
other expenses decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease relates to a decrease in amounts paid for professional services due to the hiring of an administrative staff at east coast transport  llc for functions which had previously been outsourced 
the logistics and brokerage services division operating ratio  which measures the ratio of operating expenses  net of fuel surcharges  to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  increased to for from for compared to logistics and brokerage services revenues  before fuel surcharges  increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the additional revenues  before fuel surcharges  generated by east coast transport  inc  which was acquired january  and therefore had no corresponding revenues 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues in the decrease relates to the effect of additional revenues generated by the east coast transport  inc purchase on fixed costs as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
rent and purchased transportation decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease reflects increased fuel surcharges collected from customers which are netted against outside purchased transportation costs 
also contributing to the decrease was a lower average rate paid to outside transportation companies by east coast transport  inc than had been paid by the company prior to the acquisition of east coast transport  inc communications and utilities expenses decreased from 
of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to 
of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the expenses represented by this category generally have fixed cost characteristics 
the significant increase in logistics and brokerage services revenues resulting from the east coast transport  inc asset acquisition during reduced the percentage relationship of the fixed cost components to revenues as greater economies of scale were achieved 
other expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates to due diligence costs and non compete payments associated with the east coast transport  inc asset acquisition 
the logistics and brokerage services division operating ratio  which measures the ratio of operating expenses  net of fuel surcharges  to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  decreased to for from for results of operations combined services compared to our effective tax rate increased from during to during due to an increase in state income taxes 
the decrease in income from operations also resulted in a decrease in the provision for income taxes from million in to million in net income decreased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues in  representing a decrease in diluted net income per share to 
in from in compared to our effective tax rate increased from during to during due to an increase in partially non deductible per diem payments to drivers 
the decrease in income from operations also resulted in a decrease in the provision for income taxes from million in to million in net income decreased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues in  representing a decrease in diluted net income per share to in from in quarterly results of operations the following table presents selected consolidated financial information for each of our last eight fiscal quarters through december  the information has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the quarterly information

 unaudited in thousands  except earnings per share data operating revenues         total operating expenses         operating income         net income         earnings per common share basic diluted in order to conform to industry practice  during the company began to classify fuel surcharges charged to customers as revenue rather than as a reduction of operating supplies expense 
this reclassification has no effect on net operating income  net income or earnings per share 
the company has made corresponding reclassifications to comparative periods shown 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  proceeds from the sales of revenue equipment  issuances of equity securities  and borrowings under our line of credit 
during  we generated million in cash from operating activities compared to million and million in and  respectively 
investing activities used million in cash during compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the cash used in all three years related primarily to the purchase of revenue equipment tractors and trailers used in our operations 
financing activities used million in cash during compared to cash generated by financing activities of million in and million in see cash flows statement 
our primary use of funds is for the purchase of revenue equipment 
we typically use our existing lines of credit on an interim basis  in addition to cash flows from operations  to finance capital expenditures and repay long term debt 
during and  we utilized cash on hand and our lines of credit to finance revenue equipment purchases for an aggregate of million and million  respectively 
occasionally we finance the acquisition of revenue equipment through installment notes with fixed interest rates and terms ranging from to months  however as of december  and  we had no outstanding indebtedness under such installment notes 
in order to maintain our tractor and trailer fleet count it is often necessary to purchase replacement units and place them in service before trade units are removed from service 
the timing difference created during this process often requires the company to pay for new units without any reduction in price for trade units 
in this situation  the company later receives payment for the trade units as they are delivered to the equipment vendor and have passed vendor inspection 
during the twelve months ended december  and  the company received approximately million and  respectively  for units delivered for trade 
we maintain a million revolving line of credit and a million revolving line of credit line a and line b  respectively with separate financial institutions 
amounts outstanding under line a bear interest at libor determined as of the first day of each month plus  are secured by our accounts receivable and mature on may  at december  outstanding advances on line a were approximately million  consisting entirely of letters of credit  with availability to borrow million 
amounts outstanding under line b bear interest at libor determined on the last day of the previous month plus  are secured by revenue equipment and mature on june  at december   million  including million in letters of credit were outstanding under line b with availability to borrow million 
in an effort to reduce interest rate risk associated with these floating rate facilities  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of million 
for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements  see item a of this report 
during march and april  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from a public offering of  shares of its common stock 
the company repaid approximately million of long term debt obligations with the proceeds and used the remaining proceeds to fund its capital expenditures and to finance general working capital needs 
cash and cash equivalents at december  increased approximately million as compared to december  approximately million of the increase is related to the difference in amounts reclassified to accounts payable as bank drafts outstanding in excess of bank balance 
see accounts payable discussion below and cash flow statement for more information 
prepaid expenses and deposits at december  increased approximately million as compared to december  the increase relates to an increase in amounts prepaid for tractor and trailer license fees as well as prepayments of auto liability insurance premiums 
during december the company prepaid tractor and trailer license fees for the calendar year ending december  in the amount of approximately million 
in past years the company did not pay these fees until january of the new coverage year 
the company also prepaid approximately million in additional auto liability insurance premiums as compared to premiums prepaid during marketable equity securities available for sale at december  increased approximately million as compared to december  during the year ended december   the company purchased approximately million of equity securities with excess cash 
these securities  combined with equity securities purchased in prior periods  have an original cost of approximately million and a combined fair market value of million 
the company has developed a strategy to invest in securities from which it expects to receive dividends that qualify for favorable tax treatment  as well as  appreciate in value 
the company anticipates that increases in the market value of the investments combined with dividend payments will exceed interest rates paid on borrowings for the same period 
during the company had unrealized pre tax gains of approximately  and received dividends of approximately  the holding term of these securities depends largely on the general economic environment  the equity markets  borrowing rates and the company s cash requirements 
accounts payable at december  increased approximately million as compared to december  the increase is primarily related to an increase in the amount of bank drafts outstanding in excess of bank balance as compared to bank drafts outstanding at december  as of december  bank drafts of approximately million were reclassified to accounts payable as compared to approximately million reclassified as of december  the net increase also reflects the decrease of approximately million in amounts accrued for the payment of purchased transportation costs provided by outside transportation companies and a decrease of approximately million in amounts accrued for third party equipment repair costs 
for  we expect to purchase approximately new tractors and approximately trailers while continuing to sell or trade older equipment  which we expect to result in net capital expenditures of approximately million 
management believes we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next twelve months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash balances  cash flows from operations  and borrowings believed to be available from financing sources 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
on january   the company closed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of east coast transport and logistics  inc  a freight brokerage operation based in new jersey 
in connection with this acquisition  the company issued to the seller an installment note in the amount of approximately million at an interest rate of and paid cash of approximately million utilizing existing cash 
on april   the company closed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of mcneill trucking  inc  a truckload carrier based in north little rock  arkansas 
in connection with this acquisition  the company paid cash of approximately million and assumed liabilities of approximately  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  as defined in regulation s k a ii issued by the securities and exchange commission  as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt     operating leases  purchase obligations   total     represents building  facilities  and drop yard operating leases 
represents tractor and trailer purchase obligations which are cancelable by us contingent upon advance notice 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii issued by the securities and exchange commission 
insurance with respect to physical damage for tractors  cargo loss and auto liability  the company maintains insurance coverage to protect it from certain business risks 
these policies are with various carriers and have per occurrence deductibles of   and  respectively 
since  the company has elected to self insure for physical damage to trailers 
during  and continuing through  the company changed its workers compensation coverage in arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi and florida from a fully insured policy with a  per occurrence deductible to become self insured with a  per occurrence excess policy 
the company continues to be self insured for workers compensation in the state of ohio with a  self insured retention with excess insurance 
the company has elected to opt out of workers compensation coverage in texas and is providing coverage through the pam texas injury plan 
the company has reserved for estimated losses to pay such claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
the company has not experienced any adverse trends involving differences in claims experienced versus claims estimates for workers compensation claims 
letters of credit aggregating  are held by a bank as security for workers compensation claims 
the company self insures for employee health claims with a stop loss of  per covered employee per year and estimates its liability for claims incurred but not reported 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  excess capacity in the trucking industry  surpluses in the market for used equipment  interest rates  fuel taxes  license and registration fees  insurance premiums  self insurance levels  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries  such as the automotive industry  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete with other carriers 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
these factors include the following we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers and railroads  some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do  some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates  maintain our margins or maintain significant growth in our business  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected  many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some of our business to competitors  the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size and with whom we may have difficulty competing  advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments  competition from internet based and other logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates  and economies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us 
we are highly dependent on our major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers 
for  our top five customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  and our largest customer  general motors corporation  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we also provide transportation services to other manufacturers who are suppliers for automobile manufacturers 
as a result  concentration of our business within the automobile industry is greater than the concentration in a single customer 
approximately of our revenues for were derived from transportation services provided to the automobile industry 
generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation insurance coverage up to certain limits 
if medical costs continue to increase  or if the severity or number of claims increase  and if we are unable to offset the resulting increases in expenses with higher freight rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to successfully integrate businesses we acquire into our operations 
integrating businesses we acquire may involve unanticipated delays  costs or other operational or financial problems 
successful integration of the businesses we acquire depends on a number of factors  including our ability to transition acquired companies to our management information systems 
in integrating businesses we acquire  we may not achieve expected economies of scale or profitability or realize sufficient revenues to justify our investment 
we also face the risk that an unexpected problem at one of the companies we acquire will require substantial time and attention from senior management  diverting management s attention from other aspects of our business 
we cannot be certain that our management and operational controls will be able to support us as we grow 
difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the transportation industry experiences difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors  resulting in intense competition for drivers 
we have from time to time experienced under utilization and increased expenses due to a shortage of qualified drivers 
if we are unable to continue to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to further adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
if we are unable to retain our key employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we are highly dependent upon the services of the following key employees robert w 
weaver  our president and chief executive officer  w 
clif lawson  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  and larry j 
goddard  our vice president and chief financial officer 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of these executives 
the loss of any of their services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future profitability 
we must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth 
we cannot assure that we will be able to do so 
we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future  we may have to limit our growth  enter into financing arrangements  or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our profitability 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks  and discharge and retention of stormwater 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at five of our facilities 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the us department of transportation and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  and financial reporting 
we may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours in service  and ergonomics 
compliance with such regulations could substantially impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses 
the epa recently adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through  for engines manufactured in october and thereafter 
in part to offset the costs of compliance with the new epa engine design requirements  some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices and eliminated or sharply reduced the price of repurchase or trade in commitments 
if new equipment prices were to increase  or if the price of repurchase commitments by equipment manufacturers were to decrease  more than anticipated  we may be required to increase our depreciation and financing costs and or retain some of our equipment longer  with a resulting increase in maintenance expenses 
to the extent we are unable to offset any such increases in expenses with rate increases or cost savings  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if our fuel or maintenance expenses were to increase as a result of our use of the new  epa compliant engines  and we are unable to offset such increases with fuel surcharges or higher freight rates  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  our business and operations could be adversely impacted if we experience problems with the reliability of the new engines 
we began operating tractors with engines meeting the epa guidelines during although we have not experienced any significant reliability issues with these engines to date  the expenses associated with the tractors containing these engines have been slightly elevated  primarily as a result lower fuel efficiency and slightly higher depreciation 
inflation inflation has an impact on most of our operating costs 
recently  the effect of inflation has been minimal 
competition for drivers has increased in recent years  leading to increased labor costs 
while increases in fuel and driver costs affect our operating costs  we do not believe that the effects of such increases are greater for us than for other trucking concerns 
adoption of accounting policies see item financial statements and supplementary data  note to the consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to the company s operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers  third parties and vendors and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
property and equipment 
management must use its judgment in the selection of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers which in some cases do not have guaranteed residual values 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal which  in many cases include guaranteed residual values by the manufacturers 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data either provided by outside claims administrators or developed internally 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized in full upon completion of delivery to the receiver s location 
for freight in transit at the end of a reporting period  the company recognizes revenue prorata based on relative transit miles completed as a portion of the estimated total transit miles with estimated expenses recognized upon recognition of the related revenue 
prepaid tires 
tires purchased with revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the related equipment 
replacement tires are included in prepaid expenses and deposits and are amortized over a month period 
costs related to tire recapping are expensed when incurred 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed to be necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial circumstances were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  judgment would need to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
business segment and concentrations of credit risk 
the company operates in one business segment  motor carrier operations 
the company provides transportation services to customers throughout the united states and portions of canada and mexico 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations and generally does not require collateral from its customers 
the company maintains reserves for potential credit losses 
in view of the concentration of the company s revenues and accounts receivable among a limited number of customers within the automobile industry  the financial health of this industry is a factor in the company s overall evaluation of accounts receivable 
at december   one customer s accounts receivable balance represented of the company s total accounts receivable 
business combinations and goodwill 
upon acquisition of an entity  the cost of the acquired entity must be allocated to assets and liabilities acquired 
identification of intangible assets  if any  that meet certain recognition criteria is necessary 
this identification and subsequent valuation requires significant judgments 
the carrying value of goodwill was tested for impairment on december  the impairment testing requires an estimate of the value of the company as a whole  as the company has determined it only has one reporting unit as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risk exposures include equity price risk  interest rate risk  and commodity price risk the price paid to obtain diesel fuel for our tractors 
the potential adverse impact of these risks and the general strategies we employ to manage such risks are discussed below 
the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that an adverse change may have on the overall economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results of changes in prices or rates may differ materially from the hypothetical results described below 
equity price risk we hold certain actively traded marketable equity securities which subjects the company to fluctuations in the fair market value of its investment portfolio based on current market price 
the recorded value of marketable equity securities increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase reflects additional purchases of approximately million during and an increase in the fair market value of approximately 
million during a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or approximately  for additional information with respect to the marketable equity securities  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our two lines of credit each bear interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus a fixed percentage 
accordingly  changes in libor  which are effected by changes in interest rates  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  the lines of credit 
in an effort to manage the risks associated with changing interest rates  we entered into interest rate swap agreements effective february  and may   on notional amounts of  and  respectively 
the pay fixed rates under the  and  swap agreements are and  respectively
