item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
we are the largest operator and developer of orthotic and prosthetic o p patient care centers in the united states 
orthotics is the design  fabrication  fitting and device maintenance of custom made braces and other devices such as spinal  knee and sports medicine braces that provide external support to treat musculoskeletal disorders 
musculoskeletal disorders are ailments of the back  extremities or joints caused by traumatic injuries  chronic conditions  diseases  congenital disorders or injuries resulting from sports or other activities 
prosthetics is the design  fabrication and fitting of custom made artificial limbs for patients who have lost limbs as a result of traumatic injuries  vascular diseases  diabetes  cancer or congenital disorders 
we have two segments  the patient care services segment  which generated approximately of our net sales in  and the distribution of o p components segment  which accounted for of our net sales 
our operations are located in states and the district of columbia  with a substantial presence in california  florida  ohio  pennsylvania  illinois  new york  texas and georgia 
patient care we generate sales primarily from patient care services related to the fabrication  fitting and maintenance of o p devices 
the increase or decrease in our same center sales growth represents the aggregate change in our patient care centers sales in the current fiscal year compared to the preceding fiscal year 
patient care centers that have been owned by the company for at least one full year are included in the computation 
during and  same center sales decreased by and increased by  respectively  compared to the preceding year 
we acquired additional patient care centers during we operated and patient care centers at december  and  respectively  and three distribution facilities at both december  and our revenues and results of operations are affected by seasonal considerations 
the adverse weather conditions often experienced in certain geographical areas of the united states during the first calendar quarter of each year  together with a greater degree of patients sole responsibility for their insurance deductible payment obligations during the beginning of each calendar year  have generally contributed to lower net sales in the first quarter 
in our patient care segment  we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors affecting cost of goods sold 
estimated cost of goods sold is adjusted in the fourth quarter after the annual physical inventory is taken on october  and compiled and a new accrual rate is established 
distribution southern prosthetic supply  inc sps  our distribution segment  is the largest distributor of o p devices in the united states 
sps had net sales of million in with million  or  of total net sales made to our patient care centers  and million  or  made to non hanger practitioners 
sps has three distribution centers strategically located in the united states 
sps is able to deliver virtually any order within hours of receipt 
the ability to quickly deliver orders allows us to maintain much lower levels of inventory in our patient care centers 
results and outlook net income did not meet management s expectations in due principally to a lack of sales growth in our patient care centers and the recognition of a million in goodwill impairment charge 
however  for the fourth consecutive year  we generated in excess of million in cash flows from operations 
day s sales outstanding dso  which is the number of days between the billing for our o p services and the date of our receipt of payment thereof  for the year ended december  decreased to days from days for the prior year 
the decrease in dso is due to an increased effort at the patient care centers to target collections as well as the implementation of electronic billing 
we believe that improvement in this area will continue due to the efficiencies resulting from our new billing system 
we expect our continued investment in marketing  both in local sales force and in personnel and systems to support national contracts  will enable us to increase our market share in during  we initiated deployment of linkia  the first managed care service dedicated solely to serving the o p market 
linkia partners with healthcare insurance companies by securing national and regional contracts to coordinate all of the o p needs of those companies 
in march of  the company entered into its first linkia contract  and we expect to sign additional contracts in we will continue deployment of linkia through and although it is too early to assess the overall success of this effort  we expect the linkia contracts to begin impacting sales during the second half of as the new contracts are phased in on a geographic basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates our analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we have chosen accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note b to the consolidated financial statements as presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices and associated services to patients are recorded when the device is accepted by the patient  provided that i there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the sales price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is deemed probable 
revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices to customers by our distribution segment are recorded upon the shipment of products  in accordance with the terms of the invoice  net of merchandise returns received and the amount established for anticipated returns 
discounted sales are recorded at net realizable value 
deferred revenue represents both deposits made prior to the final fitting and acceptance by the patient and prepaid tuition and fees received from students enrolled in our practitioner education program 
revenue at our patient care centers segment is recorded net of all governmental adjustments  contractual adjustments and discounts 
we employ a systematic process to ensure that our sales are recorded at net realizable value and that any required adjustments are recorded on a timely basis 
the contracting module of our centralized  computerized billing system and our older computerized billing systems currently in place  are designed to record revenue at net realizable value based on our contract with the patient s insurance company 
updated billing information is received periodically from payors and is uploaded into our centralized contract module and then disseminated to all patient care centers electronically 
at the present time  we are unable to determine the composition of our accounts receivable by payor or the composition of the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense by payor 
prior to the implementation o p s  a centralized billing system  the company utilized approximately legacy billing systems  each with somewhat different functionality and reporting capabilities 
the payor mix information mentioned above was not available from the combined reporting capabilities of these legacy platforms 
upon completion of the rollout of o p s  we will develop a report to provide this information for the period after the conversion 
in order to allow time to test the accuracy of the report and new database  we believe the first report in which we will be able to disclose this information will be in the first quarter of however  the information will not be comparative until the first quarter of disallowed sales generally relate to billings to payors with whom we do not have a formal contract 
in these situations we record the sale at usual and customary ratesand simultaneously record a disallowed sale to reduce the sale to net value  based on our historical experience with the payor in question 
disallowed sales may also result if the payor rejects or adjusts certain billing codes 
billing codes are frequently updated within our industry 
as soon as updates are received  we reflect the change in our centralized billing system 
as part of our preauthorization process with payors  we validate our ability to bill the payor  if applicable  for the service we are providing before we deliver the device 
subsequent to billing for our devices and services  there may be problems with pre authorization or with other insurance coverage issues with payors 
if there has been a lapse in coverage  the patient is financially responsible for the charges related to the devices and services received 
if we do not collect from the patient  we record bad debt expense 
occasionally  a portion of a bill is rejected by a payor due to a coding error on our part and we are prevented from pursuing payment from the patient due to the terms of our contract with the insurance company 
we appeal these types of decisions and are generally successful 
this activity is factored into our methodology to determine the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we immediately record a disallowed sale for any claims that we know we will not recover and adjust our future estimates accordingly 
certain accounts receivable may be uncollectible  even if properly pre authorized and billed 
regardless of the balance  accounts receivable amounts are periodically evaluated to assess collectibility 
in addition to the actual bad debt expense recognized during collection activities  we estimate the amount of potential bad debt expense that may occur in the future 
this estimate is based upon our historical experience as well as a review of our receivable balances 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate cash collections  accounts receivable balances and write off activity to assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  a company wide evaluation of collectibility of receivable balances older than days is performed at least semi annually  the results of which are used in the next allowance analysis 
in these detailed reviews  the account s net realizable value is estimated after considering the customer s payment history  past efforts to collect on the balance and the outstanding balance  and a specific reserve is recorded if needed 
from time to time  the company may outsource the collection of such accounts to outsourced agencies after internal collection efforts are exhausted 
in the cases when valid accounts receivable cannot be collected  the uncollectible account is written off to bad debt expense 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
at our patient care centers segment  we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors  such as sales mix and purchasing trends among other factors  affecting cost of goods sold during the current reporting periods 
estimated cost of goods sold during the period is adjusted when the annual physical inventory is taken 
we treat these adjustments as changes in accounting estimates 
at our distribution segment  a perpetual inventory is maintained 
management adjusts our reserve for inventory obsolescence whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying cost of certain inventory items is in excess of its market price 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to net identifiable assets of purchased businesses 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  annually 
any impairment would be recognized by a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
during the third quarter of  the decline in the fair value of our stock triggered an interim valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on the results of the interim valuation  we recognized an impairment charge of million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
our interim valuation included the calculation of the estimated business enterprise value using present value factors and estimated annual revenue  cash flows and debt free net earnings growth rates and comparing the calculated business enterprise value with the company s current asset book value 
we completed our annual impairment test as of october   which did not result in additional impairment charges 
non compete agreements are recorded based on agreements entered into by us and are amortized  using the straight line method  over their terms ranging from five to seven years 
other definite lived intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized  using the straight line method  over their estimated useful lives of up to years 
whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these intangibles may not be recoverable  management reviews and assesses the future cash flows expected to be generated from the related intangible for possible impairment 
any impairment would be recognized as a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
deferred tax assets liabilities we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial accounting purposes than for income tax purposes 
deferred income taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
we recognize deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not the assets will be realized in future years 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as the deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not reasonably assured  we must establish a valuation allowance  which will continually be assessed 
after having determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance may be reversed  resulting in a benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation is accounted for using the intrinsic value based method 
no stock based employee compensation expense for stock options is reflected in net income as all options granted under our stock based employee compensation plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as it pertains to restricted shares of common stock issued to our directors and certain employees  we recognize the fair value of those shares at the date of grant as unearned compensation and amortize such amount to compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of each grant 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas r 
sfas r revised employers disclosures regarding pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  but it did not change the measurement or recognition of such plans 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r as of january the adoption of sfas r did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   requires abnormal balances of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage to be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether such costs meet the criterion of so abnormal as defined in arb in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to conversion costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we expect to adopt sfas on january  and anticipate this will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment fas r  which revises fas  accounting for stock based compensation fas  supersedes the accounting principles board s opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
although the methodology of accounting for share based payments in fas r is similar to that under fas  fas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including stock option grants  be recognized at fair value in the statement of operations 
we expect to adopt fas r on july  using the modified prospective method allowed for in fas r 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense related to awards granted prior to and not vested as of the adoption of fas r is calculated in accordance with fas and recognized in the statements of operations over the requisite remaining service period  compensation expense for all awards granted after the adoption of fas r is recognized according to the provision of fas r 
we are currently evaluating the impact adopting fas r will have on our financial statements

revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  which was provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by ge capital  is a senior secured revolving credit facility providing for loans of up to million which will terminate on february  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at an annual rate equal to libor plus a variable margin rate or the base rate as defined in the debt agreement plus a variable margin rate 
in each case  the variable margin rate is subject to adjustments based on financial performance 
at december   the interest rates have been adjusted to libor plus 
our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in our subsidiaries shares  all of our assets and all of the assets of our subsidiaries 
we can prepay borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty 
the revolving credit facility requires compliance with various financial covenants  including a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  a maximum total leverage ratio  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as well as other covenants 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  our compliance with these covenants and monitor any matters critical to continue our compliance 
the revolving credit facility contains customary events of default and is subject to various mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions 
during the third quarter of  the revolving credit facility agreement was amended to modify certain covenant calculations 
the amended provisions increased the total leverage and senior secured leverage ratio limitations  reduced the interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio limitations and reduced permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we incurred million in debt financing costs related to that amendment 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
redeemable convertible preferred stock during november  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock for a total price of million including a premium of million 
we incurred costs of million on the transaction 
general we believe that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash generated from operations  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund anticipated capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including payments due on the senior notes  senior subordinated notes  term loan and obligations under the revolving credit facility 
we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and expect to fund such acquisitions from our available sources of liquidity  as discussed above 
we are limited to million in acquisitions in fiscal  according to the terms of the amended revolving credit facility agreement 
obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands thereafter total long term debt      interest payments on long term debt    operating leases      capital leases unconditional purchase commitments  other long term obligations     total contractual cash obligations    reflects the commitments under the supply agreement with usmc  as amended in february  and excludes cash payments related to accounts payable and accrued expenses
