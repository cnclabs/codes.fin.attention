encysive pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  synthetic  small molecule compounds to address unmet medical needs 
our research and development programs are predominantly focused on the treatment and prevention of interrelated diseases of the vascular endothelium and exploit our expertise in the area of the intravascular inflammatory process  referred to as the inflammatory cascade  and vascular diseases 
we have successfully developed one fda approved drug  argatroban  for the treatment of hit  that is marketed by gsk 
our lead drug candidate  thelin  is an endothelin receptor antagonist in phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of pah 
in addition  we have earlier stage clinical product candidates in development including tbc  a next generation endothelin receptor antagonist  and bimosiamose  being developed by our majority owned german affiliate  revotar 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue from service contracts as services are performed 
royalty revenue is recognized as products are sold by a licensee and we have received sufficient information to record a receivable 
our royalty revenue is based on net sales of product  that is  sales net of discounts  returns and allowances 
we have estimated a percentage of gross sales  based on recent experience  as an allowance for future returns  however there can be no assurance that our estimate will be accurate 
we believe  however  that differences between estimated and actual future returns will not have a material effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
revenue from collaborative research and development activities is recognized as services are performed 
we defer the recognition of milestone payments related to contractual agreements that are still in the development stage 
such deferred revenues are amortized into income over the estimated remaining development period 
milestone payments received under contractual agreements which have completed the development stage are evaluated  and either recognized into income when earned  or amortized over a future period  depending upon whether we continue to have obligations under the terms of the arrangement 
license fees received under the terms of licensing agreements for our intellectual property are deferred and amortized into income over the estimated development period of the licensed item or items 
revenue from grants is recognized as earned under the terms of the related grant agreements  typically as expenses are incurred 
amounts received in advance of services being performed under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized as services are performed 
we periodically evaluate our estimates of remaining development periods  and adjust the recognition of remaining deferred revenues over the adjusted development period remaining 
at december   remaining deferred revenue was approximately million  of which we expect to recognize approximately million over the next months 
a future change in our estimate of development periods could accelerate or decelerate the timing of future recognition of deferred revenue 
stock options we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb in accounting for our stock option plans and apply fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and related interpretations fas in reporting for our stock option plans 
apb utilizes the intrinsic value of stock options  defined as the difference between the exercise price of an option and the market price of the underlying share of common stock  on the measurement date which is generally the date of grant 
since the exercise price of employee stock options issued under our plans is set to match the market price of our common stock  there is generally no 
table of contents compensation expense recognized upon grant of employee stock options 
options granted to non employees  if any  are valued at the fair value of the option as defined by fas  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
we record compensation expense for the fair value of options granted to non employees 
the pro forma effect of recognizing the fair value of stock option grants to employees on our consolidated results of operations is discussed in note m  stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
the accounting provisions of fas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt fas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note m to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts  for years through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under fas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock option awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of fas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under fas  we are evaluating the requirements of fas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our future consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
results of operations the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter and year  and we anticipate that such fluctuations  which are largely attributable to varying research and development commitments and expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we have sustained net losses of approximately million from the date of our inception to december  we have primarily financed our operations to date through a series of private placements and public offerings of our common stock and several collaborative agreements with third parties to jointly pursue product research and development 
see discussion of liquidity and capital resources below 
see also additional risk factors in item business herein 
in april  we acquired the interest of icos in elp in a transaction also referred to as the acquisition 
for more information about the acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
of the million purchase price  million was paid at closing  and the remaining million was subject to the terms of a note to icos which was repaid in march deferred revenue of million  arising from previous payments received by us from elp for a license fee and milestones  was recognized as an offset to the purchase price  resulting in a charge for the purchase of in process research and development of million in from its inception in june through december   we and icos shared equally in the costs of elp 
icos informed us  however  that it had reached the conclusion that joint development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program through elp should not continue 
as a result  from january until the acquisition  we agreed to be responsible for of the costs of elp under the terms of a letter agreement  which expired upon the acquisition 
from its inception in june through march   we accounted for our investment in elp under the equity method 
as a result of the acquisition  we now include the accounts of elp in our consolidated financial statements 
a result of the consolidation of elp into our financial statements is that the revenue item  collaborative research and development from encysive  lp and the expense item  equity in loss of encysive  lp are eliminated and the operating expenses of elp are included in our operating expenses 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in year increased to million from million compared with year the increase is primarily due to higher royalties earned on sales of argatroban by gsk  which increased from million in to million in royalties earned on sales of argatroban under our agreement with gsk are based upon a tiered structure  which provides for increases in the royalty as a percentage of sales as sales increase 
the increase in royalties is due to higher sales of argatroban  and a corresponding higher royalty rate  as a percentage of sales  in as sales exceeded higher thresholds within the agreement 

table of contents such sales thresholds are evaluated annually 
on june   schering plough ended their funding of our research on a follow on compound pursuant to the research agreement 
accordingly  revenues arising under research agreements declined to million in from million in as discussed above  revenues in included million of collaborative research and development from elp prior to the acquisition 
license fees  milestones and grants in included approximately million resulting from the recognition of remaining deferred revenue arising from a milestone payment that had previously been received from mitsubishi 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  to million in from million in  reflecting expenses of completing the stride and related clinical and clinical pharmacological trials 
expenses related to the thelin development program increased million  to million in from million in although enrollment in stride was completed in september  we continue to incur significant expenses related to data gathering and analysis  and preparation of an nda submission for thelin 
we anticipate that research and development expenses in will be significant  as we expect to incur costs related to regulatory filings  continue stride  our ongoing long term safety clinical trial of thelin and may conduct additional clinical trials of thelin for other possible disease indications 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  to million in from million in the increase in the current year is primarily due to costs associated with our preparation for the future commercialization of thelin 
we believe that general and administrative expenses in will be significantly greater than in in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval  we expect to incur costs such as those related to establishing the warehousing and distribution process for thelin  hiring and training a field sales force  preparation and production of educational and promotional materials  and market research activities 
specifically  the commercialization of thelin will require us to significantly increase the number of our employees  resulting in significant increases in our general and administrative expenses 
operating loss operating loss increased million  to million in from million in the increased operating loss is primarily due to higher operating expenses  partially offset by higher revenues in investment income investment income declined in  to million from million due to lower levels of invested funds in  compared with minority interest in loss of revotar the minority interest  consisting of approximately of revotar s net loss  declined to million in  compared with million in in  to conserve cash  revotar s management significantly reduced operating expenses 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  it is likely that the cumulative losses of revotar will exceed the equity interest of its minority shareholders during  and we will reflect of its losses in our consolidated net income or loss thereafter 
net loss net loss increased to million in  compared with million in  primarily due to higher operating expenses associated with the thelin development program 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in year increased to million from million compared with year royalties earned on sales of argatroban by gsk increased million  or approximately in compared with  due to higher net sales of argatroban in the current year 
in  gsk created a hospital based sales force and initiated programs to increase the sales effort on argatroban in the us and canada  which we believe contributed to the increase in argatroban sales and in our royalty 
table of contents revenues 
the increase in royalties was partially offset by the elimination of collaborative research and development from related party revenues  due to the acquisition 
collaborative research and development from related party was million in year  compared with million in year  a decrease of million 
research agreement income decreased million in year  compared with year research agreement revenues are primarily comprised of payments received from schering plough for research on vla antagonists 
following the naming of a clinical candidate  and receipt of a milestone payment from schering plough in june  we continued research on backup vla antagonists until june research and development expense the endothelin receptor antagonist program has been conducted within elp from its inception in june prior to december   we included our share of elp s losses in our financial results under the caption equity in loss of elp 
as discussed above  in april  we acquired icos s interest in elp and as a result  from january until the acquisition  we agreed to be responsible for of the costs of elp under the terms of a letter agreement  which expired upon the acquisition 
total research and development expenses in year increased million  or approximately  compared with year the net increase is primarily comprised of the following items costs of thelin development included in research and development expenses in year totaled million 
our share of thelin development costs in year were included in our equity in loss of encysive  lp clinical trials costs other than for thelin development declined million in year  compared to year clinical trials costs were primarily related to our study of argatroban as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke 
other research costs in year declined million compared to  primarily due to our restructuring of our research programs in january purchase of in process research and development on the date of the acquisition  elp had no assets other than its rights to the in process research and development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we agreed to pay to icos a purchase price of million  of which million was paid on closing 
the remaining million was paid in march see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the only asset acquired was in process research and development  we recorded a charge for in process research and development of million less unamortized deferred revenues of million 
the unamortized deferred revenues of million relate to the previous payments received from elp that were being amortized into income over the estimated remaining development period 
due to the short term nature of the note and the associated interest rate  the note was not discounted when calculating the in process research and development charge 
equity in loss of encysive  lp our equity in loss of elp in year of million was comprised of our share of the partnership s expenses  all of which were related to the thelin development program 
as discussed above  year equity in loss of encysive  lp of million is comprised of of the thelin development program costs through the date of the acquisition 
thelin development costs incurred subsequent to the acquisition are consolidated in our financial statements 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million in year  compared with year year expenses  however  include expenses related to the thelin development program  primarily consisting of patent legal costs  totaling million 
general and administrative expenses other than those related to the thelin development program decreased approximately million in compared to operating loss operating loss increased million in year  compared with year the increase is primarily comprised of the million charge resulting from the acquisition  discussed above  and increased costs of the thelin development program in year 
table of contents investment income investment income declined million in year compared with year the decrease is primarily due to lower levels of funds available for investment throughout year  and to lower prevailing market interest rates in year minority interest in loss of revotar the minority interest in loss of revotar  comprised of of the net loss of revotar  was unchanged between the two year periods 
net loss net loss increased million in year  primarily due to the million charge resulting from the acquisition  and increased costs of the thelin development program in year liquidity and capital resources year and at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million  compared with million at december  we used million in cash in operating activities in year  compared to cash used by operating activities of million in the primary operating uses of cash in and were to fund our general operating expenses and the ongoing research and development programs conducted by encysive  revotar and elp  reduced by cash received from investment income  milestones  and research payments from our collaborative partners 
investing activities are primarily comprised of our investments in debt securities 
cash is generated from investment activities when marketable securities mature  and the resulting cash is utilized  primarily to fund operating activities 
in  we used million in investing activities  reflecting purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements of million  and the investment of excess cash into marketable debt securities 
in  investing activities provided million in cash  primarily due to the maturity of investments in marketable debt securities 
cash used in investing activities in also included a million payment to icos upon the acquisition  and purchases of equipment

as of december   the company had contractual obligations as follows in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total 
table of contents outlook for as a result of new data from stride  we are now preparing financial guidance based on continuing to develop thelin with regulatory submissions  further research and development and pre commercialization activities  and anticipate that financial guidance will become available in the first half of we believe royalty revenues in will be comparable to we anticipate that our operating expenses will be significant in  as we intend to continue to enroll patients in stride  a long term safety study of thelin  and are evaluating additional clinical trials of thelin in other disease applications 
we are also evaluating clinical trials for tbc  along with continued development work of compounds in our research pipeline 
we expect to incur significant expenses related to the preparation and submission of our nda  and other regulatory submissions 
we also expect to incur significant expenses related to market research  preparation of educational materials  and other activities in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval and commercialization of thelin 
longer term outlook we expect to incur substantial research and development expenditures as we design and develop biopharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will significantly increase in subsequent years because if thelin receives regulatory approval  we will incur significant commercialization expenses 
these costs include market research  hiring a qualified marketing and field sales force  establishing appropriate infrastructure to support field sales force  preparation and production of educational and promotional materials  hiring personnel to administer reimbursement from government and private third party payors  and establishing manufacturing  warehousing and distribution processes for our products 
we expect to incur significant expenses in conjunction with additional clinical trial costs for thelin and expect to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds 
these costs include hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to clinical trials  hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization  and purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
there may be additional costs in future periods related to argatroban in complying with ongoing fda requirements 
our administrative costs and costs to commercialize our products will increase as our products are further developed and marketed 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur operating losses for the next several years as we invest in research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we will require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development of our product candidates  to establish commercial scale manufacturing facilities  if necessary  and to market our products 
estimates of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including market acceptance and commercial success of argatroban  expenses and risks associated with clinical trials to expand the indications for thelin  
table of contents continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments and changes in our existing research relationships  our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements  and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
subject to these factors  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and other revenue sources  should be sufficient to fund our cash requirements into the fourth quarter of notwithstanding revenues  which may be produced through sales of potential future products  if approved  we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funds to continue the required levels of research and development to reach our long term goals 
we intend to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private equity or debt financings or bank debt 
as we assess the options regarding the worldwide marketing of thelin  we continue to review the possibility of licensing rights to thelin outside of north america 
in  the stockholders of revotar executed an agreement to provide approximately million in unsecured loans  of which our commitment was approximately million 
under the loan agreement  we and the minority shareholders have advanced our commitments to revotar as of december  we believe that revotar s existing funds and proceeds under german government scientific grants will be sufficient to fund revotar into april in order to continue to operate beyond that time  revotar will need to seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings 
revotar is actively seeking a partner or partners to develop the inhaled indications of bimosiamose 
we cannot assure you that such funding will be available on acceptable terms 
in addition  the stockholders of revotar are considering other changes to revotar s structure to provide it with additional capital including  among other things  additional equity investments by the minority shareholders and changes to intellectual property rights 
revotar is also actively seeking a partner or partners for the inhaled indications of bimosiamose 
if revotar is unable to obtain additional funding  revotar will no longer be able to continue its operations  and may have to consider various methods of maximizing shareholder value  including the sale or liquidation of its assets to its stockholders or third parties 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
although not material to our operations  we were exposed to an increased risk of fluctuating foreign exchange rates during as a result of the increasing weakness of the us dollar and our increased clinical trial activity in areas outside the us historically  we have not hedged any of these foreign currency exchange risks except at revotar 
the following describes the nature of this risk that is not believed to be material to us 
we have a majority owned affiliate in berlin  germany and consolidate the results of operations into our 
table of contents consolidated financial results 
although not material to date  our reported expenses and cash flows from this affiliate are exposed to changing exchange rates 
we also have contracts with entities in other areas outside the us that are denominated in a foreign currency 
to date  these currencies have not fluctuated materially
