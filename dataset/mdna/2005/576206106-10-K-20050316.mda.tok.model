item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a under critical accounting estimates and assumptions  certain trends and uncertainties and elsewhere in md a  massey is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  those set forth below 
coal markets are highly competitive and affected by factors beyond massey s control massey competes with coal producers in various regions of the us and overseas for domestic and international sales 
continued domestic demand for massey s coal and the prices that it will be able to obtain primarily will depend upon coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric utility industry and the domestic steel industry 
consumption by the domestic utility industry is affected by the demand for electricity  environmental and other governmental regulations  technological developments and the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  including hydroelectric power 
consumption by the domestic steel industry is primarily affected by economic growth and the demand for steel used in construction as well as appliances and automobiles 
recently  the competitive environment for coal has been impacted by worldwide economic recovery and sustained growth in a number of the largest markets in the world  including the us  china  japan and india  where demand for both electricity and steel have supported higher pricing for steam and metallurgical coal 
the cost of ocean transportation and the valuation of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies significantly impact the relative attractiveness of massey s coal as it competes on price with other foreign coal producing sources 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
coal prices are affected by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by mine operating costs and coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
the cost of mining the coal is influenced by geologic characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of high capital costs  including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems and higher labor costs due to lower productivity 
the company presently operates active underground mines  including longwall mines  and active surface mines  with highwall miners 
see item  business  under the headings mining methods and mining operations for further discussion 
massey depends on continued demand from its customers reduced demand from or the loss of massey s largest customers could have an adverse impact on massey s ability to achieve its projected revenue 
decreases in demand may result from  among other things  a reduction in consumption by the electric generation industry and or the steel industry  the availability of other sources of fuel at cheaper costs and a general slow down in the economy 
when massey s contracts with its customers reach expiration  there can be no assurance that the customers either will extend or enter into new long term contracts or  in the absence of long term contracts  that they will continue to purchase the same amount of coal as they have in the past or on terms  including pricing terms  as favorable as under existing agreements 
in the event that a large customer account is lost or a long term contract is not renewed profits could suffer if alternative buyers are not willing to purchase the company s coal on comparable terms 
see item  business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
the level of massey s indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to grow and compete and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its contracts and agreements at december   massey had million of total indebtedness outstanding  which represented of its total book capitalization 
the company has significant debt  lease and royalty obligations 
the company s ability to satisfy debt service  lease and royalty obligations and to effect any refinancing of its indebtedness will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets that the company serves as well as financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings  or other financings may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable it to fund its debt service  lease and royalty payment obligations or its other liquidity needs 

table of contents the company s relative amount of debt could have material consequences to its business  including  but not limited to i making it more difficult to satisfy debt covenants and debt service  lease payments and other obligations  ii making it more difficult to pay quarterly dividends as the company has in the past  iii increasing the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  iv limiting the company s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  v reducing the availability of cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  vi limiting the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the company s business and the industry in which the company competes  or vii placing the company at a competitive disadvantage with competitors with relatively less amounts of debt 
the covenants in massey s credit facility and the indentures governing the notes impose restrictions that may limit massey s operating and financial flexibility massey s asset based loan credit facility and the indentures governing its senior notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit the company s ability and its subsidiaries ability to  among other things i incur liens and debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  ii increase common stock dividends above specified levels  iii make loans and investments  iv prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  v engage in mergers  consolidations and asset dispositions  vi engage in affiliate transactions  vii create any lien or security interest in any real property or equipment  viii engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and ix restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
operating results below current levels or other adverse factors  including a significant increase in interest rates  could result in massey being unable to comply with certain debt covenants 
if massey violates these covenants and is unable to obtain waivers from its lenders  massey s debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by the lenders 
if the indebtedness is accelerated  massey may not be able to repay its debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if massey is able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to massey 
if massey s debt is in default for any reason  its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  complying with these covenants may also cause massey to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for massey to successfully execute its business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
massey depends on its ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves a key component to the future success of massey is its ability to continue acquiring coal reserves for development that have the geological characteristics that allow them to be economically mined 
replacement reserves may not be available or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristics of the depleting mines 
an inability to continue acquiring economically recoverable coal reserves could have a material impact on the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
massey faces numerous uncertainties in estimating its economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in its estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond massey s control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about the company s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by the company s staff 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  iii the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv assumptions governing future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties may vary substantially 
as a result  the company s estimates may not accurately reflect its actual reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to its reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
if the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future  the company s profitability could be impaired historically  a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attract new investors to the coal industry  spur the development of new mines and result in added production capacity throughout the industry  all of which can lead to increased competition and lower coal prices 
a continuation or a further increase in the current price levels of coal could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any overcapacity could reduce coal prices and therefore reduce the company s revenues 

table of contents corporate governance regulatory requirements may divert attention and resources away from more pressing business concerns  however  failing to meet such requirements may result in other negative consequences the sarbanes oxley act of and the new york stock exchange nyse corporate governance rules have created new demands and requirements upon public companies 
a significant amount of the company s time  attention and resources has been diverted from other matters in order to meet such requirements and may continue to be diverted in future years 
in addition  failing to meet any of the additional regulatory requirements  such as having to report a material weakness under the internal control over financial reporting standards of the sarbanes oxley act  may have an adverse affect on the company  including limiting its ability to access the capital markets 
severe weather may affect massey s ability to mine and deliver coal severe weather  including flooding and excessive ice or snowfall  when it occurs  can adversely affect massey s ability to produce  load and transport coal  which may negatively impact on the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs at december   less than of massey s total workforce was represented by the umwa 
six of massey s coal preparation plants and one of its smaller surface mines have a workforce that is represented by a union 
in fiscal  these six preparation plants handled approximately of massey s coal production 
there may be an increased risk of strikes and other related work actions  in addition to higher labor costs  associated with these operations 
massey has experienced some union organizing campaigns at some of its open shop facilities within the past five years 
if some or all of massey s current open shop operations were to become union represented  massey could be subject to additional risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs  which could adversely affect the stability of production and reduce its net income 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by a decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of the companies with which it does business massey has contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies pursuant to which those companies sell such coal to the ultimate users 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of these energy trading and brokering companies 
as the largest supplier of metallurgical coal to the american steel industry  massey is subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition or production volume of american steel producers

terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s business is affected by general economic conditions  fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending  and market liquidity  which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of its control  such as terrorist attacks and acts of war 
future terrorist attacks against us targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the us or its allies  or military or trade disruptions affecting the company s customers may materially adversely affect its operations 
as a result  there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to the company s customers  decreased sales of its coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from its customers 
strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the us in addition  such disruption may lead to significant increases in energy prices that could result in government imposed price controls 
it is possible that any  or a combination  of these occurrences could have a material impact on the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition

table of contents item properties operations of massey and its subsidiaries are conducted on both owned and leased properties totaling more than  acres in west virginia  kentucky  virginia  pennsylvania and tennessee 
in addition  certain owned or leased properties of massey and its subsidiaries are leased or subleased to third party tenants 
massey s current practice is to obtain a title review from a licensed attorney prior to purchasing or leasing property 
it generally has not obtained title insurance in connection with acquisitions of coal reserves 
in many cases  property title is warranted by the seller or lessor 
separate title confirmation sometimes is not required when leasing reserves where mining has occurred previously

coal reserves massey estimates that  as of december   it had total recoverable reserves of approximately billion tons consisting of both proven and probable reserves 
reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit  which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
recoverable reserves means coal that is economically recoverable using existing equipment and methods under federal and state laws currently in effect 
approximately billion tons of massey s reserves are classified as proven reserves 
proven measured reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
the remaining billion tons of massey s reserves are classified as probable reserves 
probable reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
information about massey s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by its internal engineers  geologists and finance associates 
reserve estimates are updated annually using geologic data taken from drill holes  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
coal tonnages are categorized according to coal quality  seam thickness  mineability and location relative to existing mines and infrastructure 
in accordance with applicable industry standards  proven reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced no more than  feet apart 
probable reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced  feet to  feet apart 
further scrutiny is applied using geological criteria and other factors related to profitable extraction of the coal 
these criteria include seam height  roof and floor conditions  yield and marketability 
as with most coal producing companies in central appalachia  the majority of massey s coal reserves are controlled pursuant to leases from third party landowners 
these leases convey mining rights to the coal producer in exchange for a per ton or percentage of gross sales price royalty payment to the lessor 
however  approximately of massey s reserve holdings are owned and require no royalty or per ton payment to other parties 
the average royalties for coal reserves from the company s producing properties owned and leased was approximately of produced coal revenue for the year ended december

item legal proceedings environmental show cause orders regulatory authorities implementing the smcra may order surface mining permit holders to show cause why their permits should not be suspended or revoked because of alleged patterns of violations 
a pattern of violations can be found when there are two or more violations of a same or similar type within a month period 
under these show cause orders  if a pattern of violations is found and determined to have been caused by the willful or unwarranted conduct of the company under the surface mining laws  its surface mining permits may be either suspended or revoked 
some of the company s subsidiaries have been issued show cause orders that are currently unresolved 
as of march   the west virginia department of environmental protection the wvdep had outstanding show cause orders with respect to active permits at the company s alex energy  inc  bandmill coal corporation  elk run coal company  inc  independence coal company  inc 
and marfork coal company  inc subsidiaries 
in addition  the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet knrepc had two outstanding show cause orders with respect to an active permit at sidney coal company 
the wvdep has also issued show cause orders with respect to idled permits at certain of the company s subsidiaries 

table of contents the potential impact on operations from a permit suspension in the show cause proceedings varies 
for example  some of the operations are not currently mining or processing coal  therefore  a suspension at those operations would not impact earnings 
at the active operations  suspensions could impact earnings to the extent that downtime cannot be offset by increases in production and or coal sales at other times or at other operations 
the impact of suspensions at these operations could also vary depending on when the suspensions are served 
for example  suspensions served over weekends or during scheduled maintenance periods would have lesser impacts 
the outcome of each of these actions remains uncertain  so the eventual cost to the company  if any  cannot presently be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  the company has not accrued any amounts for any wvdep or knrepc show cause orders mentioned herein 
while the cost of these matters cannot be reasonably estimated  the company does not expect these actions  or the cost of defending them  to have a material impact  either individually or collectively  on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
if a subsidiary has a permit revoked and a bond forfeited  it may be prohibited from obtaining permits for future operations 
additionally  pursuant to the ownership and control provisions of the surface mining laws  operations affiliated with that subsidiary may also be deemed ineligible to receive new permits 
an inability by the company to receive permits necessary to mine would be material 
the company does not expect that any of these proceedings will result in permit revocation or bond forfeiture 
the company continues to carefully monitor its environmental performance 
at the direction of the public and environmental policy committee of the company s board of directors  the company periodically obtains a comprehensive environmental audit conducted by an independent environmental auditing firm and continues to conduct regular internal environmental audits that are reviewed with the committee 
wvdep litigation on october   wvdep brought suit against three massey subsidiaries  independence coal company and omar mining company in the circuit court of boone county  west virginia  and marfork coal company in the circuit court of raleigh county  west virginia

independence  omar and marfork believe that compliance has been achieved for these past violations and are defending the suits vigorously 
on april   the wvdep brought suit against two massey subsidiaries  bandmill coal corporation and independence coal company in the circuit courts of logan county and boone county  west virginia  respectively 
the suits allege various violations of waste and clean water laws for bandmill primarily in and and independence primarily in and and seek unspecified amounts in fines as well as injunctive relief to compel compliance 
bandmill and independence believe that compliance has been achieved for these violations and are defending the suits vigorously

the company experienced a significant increase in costs during the past year period  with average cash cost per ton sold increasing from in fiscal to in fiscal a reconciliation of these non gaap figures is presented in footnote of item selected financial data 
the increased cost level is mainly due to materially higher supply costs  including diesel fuel  steel and explosives  higher labor and benefit costs  and lower operating productivity 
the company s management is focused on reducing costs and employing higher productivity mining methods  such as surface mining and highwall mining  and utilizing more high productivity mine equipment 
on january   the company established an asset based revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings of up to million  depending on the level of eligible inventory and accounts receivable  and includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit

table of contents year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease produced coal revenue per ton sold utility metallurgical industrial weighted average the improvement in massey s year to date average per ton sales prices is attributable to higher demand for all grades of coal in the us and for metallurgical coal worldwide in a continuing global economic recovery and rapid economic expansion in china resulted in shortages of certain coals and led to increases in the market prices of these coals 
the company was able to take advantage of the market situation during  even though the majority of its coal was committed to customers prior to the rise in coal prices  by shifting some production from the utility market to the higher priced export metallurgical market  supplemented by purchases of steam coal for utility customers 
the company s exports of metallurgical coal increased by million tons  or percent  to million tons for from million tons in freight and handling revenue increased million  or percent  to million for compared with million for  due to increased export shipments and more shipments to customers where freight and handling are paid by the company

costs cost of produced coal revenue increased approximately percent to  million for from  million for this increase resulted from a variety of factors including heavy rains that caused flooding and power outages at a number of the company s mines in west virginia during the summer months  higher labor and training costs due to an increasingly tight labor market for coal miners  increased supply costs  including diesel fuel  explosives and steel prices  and longwall productivity issues 
also negatively impacting cost of produced coal revenue were higher sales related costs for production royalties and taxes associated with the increase in average realized prices 
generally  these sales related costs are computed as a percentage of sales prices and will increase as coal revenues increase 
tons produced during the year ended december   were million compared to million during the year ended december  as production was greater than shipped tons  coal inventories in various stages of production increased during freight and handling costs increased million  or percent  to million for compared with million for  due to increased export shipments and more shipments to customers where freight and handling are paid by the company 
cost of purchased coal revenue decreased million  or percent  to million for from million for  due to a decrease in purchased tons sold from million in to million in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by percent to million in compared to million in  due in part to a significant investment in new surface mining equipment during and the write off of million pre tax of capitalized development costs at an idle mine and an active gas well during selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher stock based compensation accruals based on the appreciation and higher average market price of the company s common stock during compared to which was offset by a reduction in of the company s bad debt reserves of million due to the re evaluation of the total reserve  in light of improved market conditions for the steel industry and the company s tighter credit terms

table of contents other revenue  which consists of royalties  rentals  coal handling facility fees  gas well revenues  synfuel earnings  gains on the sale of non strategic assets  contract buyout payments  and miscellaneous income  decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in contract buyout payments from  offset by increased earnings related to the operations of appalachian synfuel  in insurance settlement revenue consists of million of proceeds received for the settlement of a property and business interruption claim  which  after adjusting for a previously booked receivable and claim settlement expenses  resulted in a gain of million pre tax during costs cost of produced coal revenue decreased approximately percent to  million for from  million for cost of produced coal revenue on a per ton of coal sold basis decreased slightly in compared with  primarily as the result of a charge of million pre tax related to an adverse jury verdict in the harman mining corporation action in west virginia in the second quarter of and a charge of million pre tax related to the duke arbitration award in the fourth quarter of the company experienced lower costs during the second quarter of  while costs in the other three quarters were negatively impacted by a variety of operational and shipping issues 
the most significant source of higher costs related to the company s longwall operations 
several longwall equipment moves took longer than planned  hard cutting at certain locations was experienced  and a methane gas pocket closed one of the mines for a period of time  reducing overall productivity at various times during the year 
the company attempted to improve productivity at the longwall mines by adding higher horsepower shearers in order to facilitate cutting in more difficult coal seams 
in addition  bad weather slowed some surface mine operations and prevented timely shipments by rail or truck 
surface mine production was also impacted by higher than anticipated overburden ratios  slow receipt of required permits  higher diesel fuel costs and increased trucking costs due to new west virginia regulations 
the company purchased new surface mine equipment in late and early to increase capacity and productivity at several surface mines  including several newly permitted surface mines that are expected to have low overburden ratios and less trucking required 
expenses were further impacted by the continuation of employee medical cost inflation  including workers compensation costs and higher bonding and insurance costs 
in response to the higher medical costs  in the company implemented a new employee medical plan to mitigate the effects of medical cost inflation expected in freight and handling costs decreased million  or percent  to million for compared with million for  due to a decrease in tons sold over the comparable periods and fewer shipments to customers where freight and handling costs are paid by the company 
cost of purchased coal revenue decreased million to million for from million for  due to the decrease in purchased tons sold 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased by percent to million in compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to a million pre tax write off of mine development costs at certain idled mines in see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment charges

massey believes that cash on hand  cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and anticipated dividend payments for at least the next few years 
nevertheless  the ability of massey to satisfy its debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond massey s control 
massey frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
in the past  massey has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations  but massey may consider a variety of other sources  depending on the size of any transaction  including debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital resources will be available to massey on terms that massey finds acceptable  or at all 
contractual obligations the company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities within the consolidated financial statements 
other obligations  such as certain purchase commitments  operating lease agreements  and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities within the consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
the following table is a summary of the company s significant obligations as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash

capital lease obligations include the amount of imputed interest over the terms of the leases 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
coal purchase obligations represent commitments to purchase coal from external production sources under firm contracts as of december  coal lease obligations includes minimum royalties paid on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  the company has generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of years 
other purchase obligations primarily include capital expenditure commitments for surface mining and other equipment as well as purchases of materials and supplies 
the company has purchase agreements with vendors for most types of operating expenses 
however  the company s open purchase orders which are not recognized as a liability until the purchased items are received under these purchase agreements  combined with any other open purchase orders  are not material and are excluded from this table 
other purchase obligations also includes contractual commitments under transportation contracts 
since the actual tons to be shipped under these contracts are not set and will vary  the amount included in the table reflects the minimum payment obligations required by the contracts 

table of contents additionally  the company has liabilities relating to pension and other postretirement benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years the company s determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if the company s assumptions are inaccurate  the company could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  the company s estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if its assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  the company does not expect any material impact on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
the company uses surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation  wage payments  and other miscellaneous obligations 
as of december   the company had million of outstanding surety bonds 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment and collection bonds of million  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
generally  the availability and market terms of surety bonds continue to be challenging 
if the company is unable to meet certain financial tests  or to the extent that surety bonds otherwise become unavailable  the company would need to replace the surety bonds or seek to secure them with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   the company had secured million of surety obligations with letters of credit 
from time to time the company uses bank letters of credit to secure its obligations for worker s compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
at december   the company had million of letters of credit outstanding including the million noted above that secure surety obligations  of which million was collateralized by million of cash deposited in restricted  interest bearing accounts pledged to issuing banks and million was issued under the company s asset based lending arrangement 
no claims were outstanding against those letters of credit as of december  certain trends and uncertainties inability to satisfy contractual obligations may adversely affect massey s profitability from time to time  massey has disputes with customers over the provisions of long term contracts relating to  among other things  coal quality  pricing  quantity  delays and force majeure declarations 
in addition  massey may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to meet customer commitments 
massey s inability to satisfy its contractual obligations could result in the company purchasing coal from third party sources to satisfy those obligations or may result in customers initiating claims against massey 
the company may not be able to resolve all of these disputes in a satisfactory manner  which could result in substantial damages or otherwise harm its relationships with customers 
shortages of skilled labor in the central appalachian coal industry may pose a risk to achieving high levels of productivity and competitive costs coal mining continues to be a labor intensive industry 
in  the company experienced a shortage of experienced mine workers when the demand and prices for all specifications of coal mined by the company increased appreciably 
the company s productivity and cash costs were negatively impacted by the hiring of these less experienced workers 
a continued lack of skilled miners could continue to have an adverse impact on massey s labor productivity and cost and its ability to expand production to meet the increased demand for coal 

table of contents transportation disruptions could impair massey s ability to sell coal massey s transportation providers are important in order to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lockouts or other events could temporarily impair massey s ability to supply coal to customers 
throughout  the company s ability to ship coal was negatively impacted by a reduction in available and timely rail service 
lack of sufficient resources to meet the rapid increase in demand  a greater demand for transportation to export terminals and rail line congestion all seem to have contributed to the disruption and slowdowns in rail service 
while the railroads have taken action to remedy these issues  including the purchase of new locomotives and railcars  as well as the hiring and training of additional crews  the company expects weak rail service to continue to affect its operations through at least the first half of and could impact shipments in future years 
in  more stringent coal truck weight limits and enforcement laws were adopted in the state of west virginia 
in addition  law enforcement officials in both the state of west virginia and the commonwealth of kentucky stepped up enforcement of coal truck weight limits 
although massey has historically avoided trucking coal on public roads  by transporting coal by rail  barge and conveyor systems whenever possible  such legislation and stepped up enforcement actions have resulted in reduced availability of trucks  shipment delays and increased costs 
certain of massey s subsidiaries and other coal and transportation companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits in west virginia 
the suits allege that the defendants illegally transported coal in overloaded trucks causing damage to state roads and interfering with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of their properties and their right to use the public roads  and seek injunctive relief and damages 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this litigation 
government regulations increase massey s costs and may discourage customers from burning coal massey incurs substantial costs and liabilities under increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental  health and safety and endangered species laws  including regulations and governmental enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations  the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from the company s operations 
the company may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from its operations 
see item  business  under the headings environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
new legislation and new regulations may be adopted which could materially adversely affect massey s mining operations  cost structure or its customers ability to use coal 
new legislation and new regulations may also require massey or its customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs 
the epa has undertaken broad initiatives aimed at increasing compliance with emissions standards and to provide incentives to customers for decreasing emissions  often by switching to an alternative fuel source 
on february   the governor of west virginia signed into law an increase in the coal severance tax of per clean ton on west virginia coal production beginning november  the funds generated by this additional severance tax will be used to help the state of west virginia resolve an estimated billion shortfall in its workers compensation program 
while massey expects to be able to pass through a portion of this additional cost to its customers and expects some reduction in future workers compensation premiums  it does anticipate that the tax will add to its per ton cost beginning in late massey is subject to being adversely affected by the potential inability to renew or obtain surety bonds federal and state laws require bonds to secure the company s obligations to reclaim lands used for mining  to pay federal and state workers compensation  and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable annually 
surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals 
the company s failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material impact on the company 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including the following i lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds  ii restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of the company s senior notes or revolving credit facilities  iii the inability of the company to meet certain financial tests with respect to a portion of the post mining reclamation bonds  and iv the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the bonds 

table of contents foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of massey s coal abroad massey relies on customers in other countries for a portion of its sales  with shipments to countries in north america  south america  europe  asia and africa 
massey competes in these international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in us dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in us dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations in producing countries could adversely affect the competitiveness of us coal in international markets 
high oil prices could lead to a phase out of irc section tax credits  reducing the company s earnings from a promissory note tied to section tax credits owners of facilities that produce synthetic fuels can qualify for tax credits under the provisions of irc section in and  the company sold most its interest in a synfuel facility 
as part of the compensation for the sale  the company received a contingent promissory note that is paid on a cents per section credit dollar earned based on synfuel tonnage shipped through the payments to be received under the contingent promissory note may be reduced or eliminated if the price of oil remains above a certain threshold price set by the irs the threshold price 
once the threshold price is reached  the section credits will be phased out ratably over a per barrel range above the threshold price 
the threshold price for will be set by the irs in april and is expected to be in the range of to per barrel 
if the value of the section credits is eliminated or significantly reduced  the owner of the synfuel facility may elect to idle the facility  suspending the earnings the company receives from the facility 
during the year ending december   the company recognized earnings of approximately million related to the sale of the synfuel facility and activities related to the synfuel facility 
should the price of oil exceed the threshold price  the earnings the company receives related to this synfuel facility will be reduced or eliminated and the company may incur a loss 
fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for massey s coal transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on massey s ability to compete with other energy sources and on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country 
for instance  coal mines in the western us could become an attractive source of coal to consumers in the eastern part of the country if the costs of transporting coal from the west were significantly reduced 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks massey s operations are subject to certain events and conditions that could disrupt operations  including fires and explosions from methane  accidental minewater discharges  natural disasters  equipment failures  maintenance problems and flooding 
massey maintains insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some  but not all  of these risks 
even where insurance coverage applies  there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by massey s insurance policies 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
significant changes to the estimates and assumptions used in determining certain liabilities described below introduce substantial volatility to the company s costs 
the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions were used in the preparation of the financial statements defined benefit pension the estimated cost and benefits of the company s non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with the company s review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the applicable liabilities could be effectively settled as of the measurement date 
in estimating the discount rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the discount rate used to determine defined benefit pension liability was compared to at december  a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the company s defined benefit pension obligation 
such increases in the obligation are included in actuarial gains and losses and recognized in the determination of the defined benefit pension expense over the remaining service lives of plan participants 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon the company s long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels used was for the years ended december  and the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense in each period was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a decrease in the expected rate of return assumption increases the defined benefit pension expense 

table of contents coal workers pneumoconiosis the company is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
an annual evaluation is prepared by the company s independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by the company  use various assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs trend  cost of living trend  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the company records expense related to this obligation using the service cost method 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the black lung liability was compared to at december  a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the company s black lung liability 
such increases in the liability are included in actuarial gains and losses and recognized in the determination of the black lung expense over a five year period 
included in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a medical cost trend and cost of the company s living trend sensitivity analysis 
workers compensation the company s operations have workers compensation coverage through a combination of either self insurance  participation in a state run program  or commercial insurance 
the company accrues for the self insured liability by recognizing cost when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability the company utilizes the services of third party administrators who derive claim reserves from historical experience 
these third parties provide information to independent actuaries  who after review and consultation with the company with regards to actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  prepare an evaluation of the self insured liabilities 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the self insured workers compensation liability obligation was compared to at december  a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the workers compensation self insured liability and related expense 
actual experience in settling these liabilities could differ from these estimates  which could increase the company s costs 
other postretirement benefits the company s sponsored health care plans provide retiree health benefits to eligible union and non union retirees who have met certain age and service requirements 
depending on year of retirement  benefits may be subject to annual deductibles  coinsurance requirements  lifetime limits  and retiree contributions 
these plans are not funded 
costs are paid by the company as incurred by participants 
the estimated cost and benefits of the company s retiree health care plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by the company  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit liability was compared to at december  a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the company s retiree medical liability 
such increases in the liability are included in actuarial gains and losses and recognized in the determination of the retiree medical expense over the remaining service lives of plan participants 
at december  the company s assumptions of the company health care plans cost trend were projected at an annual rate of ranging down to by ranging down to by at december   and remaining level thereafter 
included in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a sensitivity analysis on the health care trend rate assumption 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
the company s total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and its engineering estimates related to these requirements 
the company adopted sfas effective january  sfas requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed is reviewed periodically by the company s management and engineers 
in estimating future cash flows  the company considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit  as necessary 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on behalf of the company 
the discount rate applied is based on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow  adjusted for the company s credit standing 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
contingencies the company is the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
the company has accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
unless otherwise noted  management does not believe that the outcome or timing of current legal or environmental matters will have a material impact on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see item  legal proceeding s and note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company s contingencies 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  the company takes into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of the company s valuation allowance  the company records a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
the company has a reserve for taxes that may become payable as a result of audits in future periods with respect to previously filed tax returns included in deferred tax liabilities separate disclosure has not been made because the amount is not considered material 
it is the company s policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
the company establishes the reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences ie  tax depletion expense  etc  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserve 
the company is currently under audit from the irs for the fiscal years ended october  and december  it is expected that the irs audit will be completed in and may provide a favorable adjustment to the tax reserve 
the company s federal income tax returns have been examined by the irs  or statutes of limitations have expired through october  coal reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond the company s control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about the company s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by its staff 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  iii the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv assumptions governing future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their grant date fair values for interim or annual periods beginning after june  pro forma disclosure of stock option expense will no longer be permitted 
the cost will be recognized over the requisite service period that an employee must provide to earn the award ie usually the vesting period 
the company expects to adopt sfas r on july  using the modified prospective method and expects a pre tax charge to income of approximately million for the expensing of unvested stock options for the period july  through december  sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excess spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory cost incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial statements 
in the second quarter of  in response to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare modernization act enacted on december   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
the medicare modernization act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the company included the effects of the medicare modernization act in its financial statements as of july  in accordance with fsp incorporation of the provisions of the medicare modernization act resulted in a reduction in the company s postretirement benefit obligation as of july  of million 
the impact of the medicare modernization act resulted in a reduction in the net periodic postretirement benefit cost of million for the second half of certain definitions and interpretations  yet to be issued by the federal government  could require the company to adjust future estimates 
at its september meeting  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  concerning the accounting for contingently convertible debt instruments  commonly referred to as co cos  which was ratified by the fasb on october  under previous interpretations of fasb sfas no 
 earnings per share  issuers of co cos excluded the potential common shares underlying the co co from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the market price or other contingency was met 
when the contingency was met  generally the if converted method was used to calculate the dilutive impact of the instrument 
under the if converted method  the instrument is considered converted  with the resulting number of shares included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation and the interest expense  net of tax  added back to the numerator of the diluted earnings per share 
the eitf concluded that the contingently issuable shares guidance in sfas does not apply to convertible debt 
therefore  the eitf determined that issuers of co cos should include the dilutive effect in the calculation of diluted earnings per share immediately upon issuance of the instrument  generally using the if converted method 
the eitf concluded that application should be by retroactive restatement of earnings per share 
the implementation date was for reporting periods ending after december   or the fourth quarter of for the company 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements in the earnings per share section for a discussion of the company s convertible notes and the impact on earnings per share 
in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets eitf 
in this issue  the eitf reached the consensus that mineral rights are tangible assets 
this consensus differed from the requirements of sfas no 
business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas which characterize mineral rights as intangible assets 
as a result  the fasb amended sfas and sfas to eliminate the inconsistency 
historically  the company has treated mineral rights as a tangible asset included within property  plant and equipment  therefore  eitf had no effect on its financial statements 
other accounting developments the company currently accounts for the costs of removing overburden and waste materials stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine as a component of surface mining inventory costs 
as overburden is removed  the stripping costs are captured in inventory costs and attributed to the proved reserves benefited 
it is generally accepted in practice in the mining industry that stripping costs prior to production phase of the mine are capitalized as part of the initial development of a surface mine 
those capitalized costs are typically amortized over the productive life of the mine using the units of production method 
there is diversity in practice throughout the mining industry with no consistent application with regards to stripping costs during the production phase of the mine 
the eitf has established a mining industry working group that is currently considering this issue issue no 
 accounting for stripping costs in the mining industry 
the conclusions of the eitf with regards to the classification and recognition of production phase stripping costs may have a significant impact on the company s financial statements depending on the findings of the task force 
see note in the inventory section to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s inventory costs 

table of contents inflation generally  inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years 
however  over the course of the last twelve months  the company has been significantly impacted by price inflation in many of the components of its cost of goods sold  such as fuel  steel  copper and labor 
for instance  the prices of diesel fuel  steel and copper increased approximately  and  respectively  over the twelve month period ending december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk massey s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
at december   the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of long term debt was under fixed rate instruments  however  the primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to an interest rate swap entered into on november   covering a notional amount of debt of million 
based on the notional amount outstanding of million  a hypothetical basis point increase in the specified swap interest rate index would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
the projected present value of the swap instrument is partially determined by movements in interest rates  and massey may be required to post cash deposits with the swap counterparty if the present value in favor of the counterparty exceeds certain threshold amounts based on massey s credit rating at the time 
if it should become necessary to borrow under the new asset based revolving credit facility  those borrowings would be also made at a variable rate 
the company manages its market price risk for coal through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which are contracts with a term of months or greater  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
the company believes that the percentage of its sales pursuant to these long term contracts was approximately for its fiscal year ended december  the company anticipates that in  the percentage of sales pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of sales for the prices for coal shipped under long term contracts may be below the current market price for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a consequence of the substantial volume of its sales  which are subject to these long term agreements  the company has less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise 
in addition  because long term contracts typically allow the customer to elect volume flexibility  the company s ability to realize the higher prices that may be available in the spot market may be restricted when customers elect to purchase higher volumes under such contracts  or the company s exposure to market based pricing may be increased should customers elect to purchase fewer tons
