property and equipment we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  to recognize and measure impairment of property and equipment owned or under capital lease 
we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of an asset group  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
we did not recognize an impairment loss related to property and equipment in either or we calculate depreciation and amortization on property and equipment for financial reporting purposes primarily by using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of our assets

as a result of this activity  and consistent with the services nature of the businesses we acquired  the largest assets on our balance sheet are intangibles resulting from business acquisitions and the jlw merger 
historically we amortized these intangibles over their estimated useful lives generally eight to forty years 
beginning january   pursuant to the issuance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we ceased the amortization of intangibles with indefinite useful lives  which have a net book value of million at december  we will continue to amortize intangibles with definite useful lives  which primarily represent the value placed on management contracts that are acquired as part of our acquisition of another business 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead evaluated for impairment at least annually 
to accomplish this annual evaluation  we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of evaluation 
under sfas  we define reporting units as investment management  americas ios  australia ios  asia ios  and by country groupings in europe ios 
we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit on the basis of a discounted cash flow methodology and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
the result of the and evaluations was that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  and therefore we did not recognize an impairment loss in either year

investments in real estate ventures we invest in certain real estate ventures that own and operate commercial real estate 
typically  these are co investments in funds that our investment management business establishes in the ordinary course of business for its clients 
these investments include non controlling ownership interests generally ranging from less than to of the respective ventures 
we apply the provisions of fasb interpretation no

the application of fin r  sop  apb and eitf d generally results in accounting for these interests under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated financial statements due to the nature of our non controlling ownership 
we apply the provisions of apb  sec staff accounting bulletin topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities sab  and sfas when evaluating investments in real estate ventures for impairment  including impairment evaluations of the individual assets underlying our investments 
we review investments in real estate ventures on a quarterly basis for an indication of whether the carrying value of the real estate assets underlying our investments in ventures may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying assets 
when an other than temporary impairment has been identified related to a real estate asset underlying one of our investments in ventures  a discounted cash flow approach is used to determine the fair value of the asset in computing the amount of the impairment 
we then record the portion of the impairment loss related to our investment in the reporting period

stock based compensation the jones lang lasalle amended and restated stock award and incentive plan saip provides for the granting of options to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock and for other stock awards to eligible employees of jones lang lasalle 
additionally  we award restricted stock units of our common stock to certain employees and members of our board of directors under the saip  and have plans under which eligible employees have the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount

we have recognized other stock awards including various grants of restricted stock units and offerings of discounted stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans  which we granted at prices below the market value of our common stock on the date of grant  as compensation expense over the vesting period of those awards pursuant to apb see note for additional information on stock based compensation 
accounting for self insurance programs in our americas business  and in common with many other american companies  we have chosen to retain certain risks regarding health insurance and workers compensation rather than purchase third party insurance 
estimating our exposure to such risks involves subjective judgments about future developments 
we engage the services of an independent actuary on an annual basis to assist us in quantifying our potential exposure 
additionally  we supplement our traditional global insurance program by the use of a captive insurance company to provide professional indemnity insurance on a claims made basis 
as professional indemnity claims can be complex and take a number of years to resolve  we are required to estimate the ultimate cost of claims 
health insurance we chose to self insure our health benefits for all us based employees for the first time in  although we did purchase stop loss coverage to limit our exposure 
we continue to purchase stop loss coverage on an annual basis 
we made the decision to self insure because we believed that on the basis of our historic claims experience  the demographics of our workforce and trends in the health insurance industry  we would incur reduced expense by self insuring our health benefits as opposed to purchasing health insurance through a third party 
we engage an actuary who specializes in health insurance to estimate our likely full year cost at the beginning of the year and expense this cost on a straight line basis throughout the year 
in the fourth quarter  we employ the same actuary to estimate the required reserve for unpaid health costs we would need at year end 
with regard to the year end reserve  the actuary provides us with a point estimate  which we accrue  additionally  in the first year of this program we accrued a provision for adverse deviation 
given the nature of medical claims  it may take up to months for claims to be processed and recorded 
workers compensation insurance given our belief  based on historical experience  that our workforce has experienced lower costs than is normal for our industry  we have been self insured for worker s compensation insurance for a number of years 
we purchase stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to large  individual claims 
on a periodic basis we accrue using the various state rates based on job classifications  engaging on an annual basis in the third quarter  an independent actuary who specializes in workers compensation to estimate our exposure based on actual experience 
given the significant judgmental issues involved in this evaluation  the actuary provides us a range of potential exposure and we reserve within that range 
we accrue for the estimated adjustment to revenues for the differences between the actuarial estimate and our reserve on a periodic basis 
captive insurance company in order to better manage our global insurance program and support our risk management efforts  we supplement our traditional insurance program by the use of a captive insurance company to provide professional indemnity insurance coverage on a claims made basis 
in the past  we have utilized the captive insurer in certain of our international operations  but effective march   as part of the renewal of our global professional indemnity insurance program  we expanded the scope of the use of the captive to provide professional indemnity coverage to our entire business 
professional indemnity insurance claims can be complex and take a number of years to resolve 
we are required to estimate the ultimate cost of these claims 
this estimate includes specific claim reserves that are developed on the basis of a review of the circumstances of the individual claim  which we update on a periodic basis 
in addition  given that the timeframe for these reviews may be lengthy  we also provide a reserve against the current year exposures on the basis of our historic loss ratio 
the increase in the level of risk retained by the captive means we would expect that the amount and the volatility of our estimate of reserves will be increased over time 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  receivables  accounts payable  notes payable and foreign currency exchange contracts 
the estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents  receivables and payables approximates their carrying amounts due to the short maturity of these instruments 
the estimated fair value of our revolving credit facility and short term borrowings approximates their carrying value due to their variable interest rate terms 
the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are estimated to be million as of december   determined by valuing the net position of the contracts using the applicable spot rates and forward rates as of the reporting date 
derivatives and hedging activities we apply fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  when accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
as a firm  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the normal course of business we do use derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts in effect with a gross notional value of million million on a net basis and a market and carrying gain of million 
in the past we have used interest rate swap agreements to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on earnings and cash flows 
we did not use any interest rate swap agreements in or in  and there were no such agreements outstanding as of december  we require that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked to market each period with changes in unrealized gains or losses recognized currently in earnings 
we hedge any foreign currency exchange risk resulting from intercompany loans through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
sfas requires that unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives be recognized currently in earnings 
the gain or loss on the re measurement of the foreign currency transactions being hedged is also recognized in earnings 
the net impact on our earnings of the unrealized gain on foreign currency contracts  offset by the loss resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions  for and was not significant 
in connection with a previous investment in an unconsolidated real estate venture  we were granted certain residual common share purchase rights giving us the ability to purchase shares in a publicly traded real estate investment trust at a fixed price 
these rights  which extended through april  were a non hedging derivative instrument and should have been recorded at fair value as part of the adoption of sfas effective january   with subsequent changes in fair value reflected in equity earnings 
the initial accounting for these common share purchase rights through june  was not in accordance with the rules of sfas due to an inadvertent error resulting from the complexity of this unique derivative 
the fair value of these common share purchase rights was recorded as a gain in equity in earnings from unconsolidated ventures in the third quarter of we determined fair value through the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of these rights at december  was million  which we included in the investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures on the consolidated balance sheet 
during the first quarter of  market conditions became favorable for us to begin disposing of these common share purchase rights  and we made the disposition during the first and second quarters of we no longer hold any such rights  and we do not own any other instruments of this nature 
foreign currency translation the financial statements of our subsidiaries located outside the united states  except those subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies  are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments included in the balance sheet as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income loss and in the statement of earnings other comprehensive income foreign currency translation adjustments 
income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rates of exchange 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings 
for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies  the associated gains and losses from balance sheet translation adjustments are included in net earnings 
statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and investments in united states treasury instruments generally held as available for sale with maturities of three months or less 
the combined carrying value of such investments approximating market value was million at december   as we held such investments in anticipation of redeeming the euro notes in june there were no such investments included in cash and cash equivalents at december  total cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  as a result of the redemption of euro notes and the use of cash to reduce debt outstanding in the effects of foreign currency translation on cash balances are reflected in cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash held for others we control certain cash and cash equivalents as agents for our investment and property management clients 
we do not include such amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes and environmental matters as well as commitments under contractual obligations 
many of these claims are covered under our current insurance programs  subject to deductibles 
we recognize the liability associated with commitments and contingencies when a loss is probable and estimable 
our contractual obligations generally relate to the provision of services by us in the normal course of our business 
see note for additional information on commitments and contingencies 
earnings per share the difference between basic weighted average shares outstanding and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is the dilutive impact of common stock equivalents 
common stock equivalents consist primarily of shares to be issued under employee stock compensation programs and outstanding stock options whose exercise price was less than the average market price of our stock during these periods 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we did not include in the weighted average shares outstanding the   or  shares that had been repurchased as of the end of each of those years and which are held by one of our subsidiaries

sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  sfas r eliminates the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
under apb  issuing stock options to employees generally has resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
however  sfas r will require us to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
that cost will be recognized over the employee s requisite service period 
employee share purchase plans espps result in recognition of compensation cost if defined as compensatory  which under sfas r includes plans that contain a look back feature  or plans that contain a purchase price discount larger than five percent  which sfas r views as the per share amount of issuance costs that would have been incurred to raise a significant amount of capital by a public offering 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
the cumulative effect of initially applying sfas r also will be recognized as of the required effective date

acquisitions jones lang lasalle asset management services acquisition in december  jones lang lasalle acquired the minority interest in the joint venture company jones lang lasalle asset management services  which  since has exclusively provided asset management services for all skandia life properties in sweden

share repurchases since october  our board of directors has approved three share repurchase programs 
each succeeding program has replaced the prior repurchase program  such that the program approved on november  is the only repurchase program in effect as of december  we are authorized under each of the programs to repurchase a specified number of shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions from time to time  depending upon market prices and other conditions 
the repurchase of shares is primarily intended to offset dilution resulting from both stock and stock option grants made under the firm s existing stock plans 
given that shares repurchased under each of the programs are not cancelled  but are held by one of our subsidiaries  we include them in our equity account 
however  these shares are excluded from our share count for purposes of calculating earnings per share 
the following table details the activities for each of our approved share repurchase programs shares shares repurchased approved for through repurchase plan approval date repurchase december  october  february  november  we repurchased  shares in at an average price of per share

in  million related to an e commerce venture written off in was recovered and recorded as a credit to non recurring expense 
however  it is currently our policy to expense any additional investments that are made into these ventures in the period they are made due to the fact that recovery of such sums is uncertain  and to record such charges as ordinary recurring charges 
in  and  we expensed million  million and million  respectively  of such investments 
land investment group we closed the non strategic residential land investment business land investment group in the americas region of the investment management segment in we determined that we would not fund these investments beyond our contractual commitments and would seek to manage an exit from this portfolio 
these assets are currently managed by a third party asset manager who provides us with cash flow projections on an annual basis 
we included in non recurring expense in an impairment provision of million to fully write down two residential land co investments as a result of adverse performance expectation developments in in the third quarter of  we sold one of the remaining assets in the land investment portfolio for no gain or loss 
in the third quarter of  we received cash proceeds of approximately million from the partial liquidation of the two assets which had been fully written down in the cash proceeds were recorded as a credit to non recurring expense 
also in the third quarter of  after receiving updated cash flow projections for one of the investments which indicated a decline in expected cash proceeds and an increase in expected expenses  we recorded an impairment charge of million to non recurring expense 
as a result  the net book value of land investment group investments as of december  is  compared with approximately million at december  we have provided guarantees associated with this investment portfolio of million  which we currently do not expect to be required to fund 
we expect these investments to be liquidated by the end of future credits relating to the liquidation process will be recorded if further cash is received 
development group as part of our broad based business restructuring in the second half of  we disposed of our americas development group  although we retained an interest in certain investments the group had originated 
in we recorded net non recurring expense of million related to equity losses and investment disposals 
in the second quarter of we liquidated the final development group investment and recorded a gain of million to non recurring expense 
insolvent insurance providers as a result of two of our insurance providers becoming insolvent in  we recorded a provision of million  of which million related to approximately claims that were covered by an insolvent australian insurance provider  hih insurance limited hih 
in the second quarter of  we reduced the reserve by million because of favorable developments in claim settlement  recording a credit to non recurring expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional reserve of million as a result of unfavorable developments in one claim 
as of december   million of the reserve established remains to cover claims which relate to the insurance provided by hih 
although there can be no assurance  we believe this reserve is adequate to cover the six remaining claims and expenses resulting from the hih insolvency 
due to the nature of the claims covered by this insurance  it is possible that future claims may be made 
abandonment of property management accounting system in the third quarter of  we settled litigation we were pursuing related to the unsuccessful implementation of an australian property management accounting system discussed below 
under the settlement agreement executed september   we received aus million million in october  and are scheduled to receive aus million in cash in the schedule of remaining installments as follows aus million million at december  rates on or before march aus million million at december  rates on or before september  aus million million at december  rates on or before december  in connection with the agreement  each of the parties has released the other from further liabilities with respect to the underlying dispute and has agreed to certain other terms typical for a settlement of this kind 
we recognized the aus million recovery as a credit of million to non recurring expense in the third quarter of we intend to account for the remaining installments on a cash basis due to the conditions of the settlement 
the installments received will be recognized in non recurring expense 
in the second quarter of  we completed a feasibility analysis of a property management accounting system that was in the process of being implemented in australia 
as a result of the review  we concluded that the potential benefits from successfully correcting deficiencies in the system to allow it to be implemented throughout australia were not justified by the costs that would have to be incurred to do so 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a charge of million to non recurring expense in the charge of million includes million for severance costs of personnel who worked exclusively on the system and million for professional fees associated with pursuing litigation against the consulting firm that was responsible for the design and implementation of this system 
for the year ended december   we recorded an additional million to non recurring expense for legal expenses associated with the settlement process 
in addition  we incurred million in the year ended december  for additional severance costs related to this matter 
we implemented a transition plan to an existing alternative system and have used this system from july  merger related stock compensation on march   lasalle partners merged its business with that of jlw and changed its name to jones lang lasalle 
in connection with this merger we issued shares of our common stock as consideration 
restrictions on certain of those shares were removed at december  see our annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of this merger 
included as part of our non recurring stock compensation expense for the year ended december   we provided for potential social tax exposures relating to the issuance of these shares 
as a result of a re evaluation of these potential exposures and changing circumstances  we determined that this reserve is no longer required  and reversed the remaining million of this provision in business restructuring business restructuring charges include severance and professional fees associated with the realignment of our business 
in  the asia pacific business underwent a realignment from a traditional geographic structure to one that is managed according to business lines 
in addition  in the second half of we implemented a broad based restructuring of our global business that reduced headcount by approximately nine percent 
the total charge for the full year of for estimated severance and related costs was million 
included in the million were million of severance costs  million of professional fees  and million of relocation and other severance related expenses 
of the estimated million adjusted down to million for reasons stated below  million had been paid at december   with a further million to be paid over the next several years as required by labor laws 
in december  we reduced our workforce by four percent to meet expected global economic conditions 
as such  we recorded million in non recurring compensation and benefits expense related to severance and certain professional fees  and million in non recurring operating  administrative and other expense in  primarily related to the lease cost of excess space 
of the estimated million adjusted down to million for reasons stated below  million had been paid at december   with the remaining million to be paid as required by labor laws 
in we charged million to non recurring operating  administrative and other expenses  the most significant portion of which related to a reserve for excess lease space of million 
this reserve related to new space that we no longer intended to occupy  but where we were committed to a long term lease 
through december   million of this reserve had been utilized against lease payments for this space 
in september  the company entered into a modified lease agreement with more favorable terms for this space  and now plans to take occupation of approximately two thirds of this space in the first quarter of as a result of this change in circumstances  a net amount of million of this reserve is no longer required and has been reversed to restructuring expense in the remaining reserve of million is for excess space in the new building which we are seeking to sublet 
we have made certain assumptions regarding the terms of any sublet in estimating the required reserve  and it is possible that additional charges or credits will be recorded with regard to this space as a sublet agreement is finalized 
additionally  the lease for the space that we currently occupy runs through january and is considered excess given our decision to occupy space in the new building 
as a result  an expense of million has been recorded to restructuring expense in the net charge to restructuring expense for excess space in  then  is million 
the balance of the reserve for excess space related to these two lease agreements at the end of the period is million 
during the fourth quarter of  we charged million to restructuring compensation and benefits expense 
these charges related to severance in germany and northern european markets  where new restructuring efforts have been initiated to realign resources in the region away from underperforming sectors and further consolidate the german business in light of continuing difficult economic conditions 
of the million charged to restructuring expense  million is expected to be paid in adjusting estimates to actual in general  the actual costs incurred related to these business restructurings have varied from our original estimates for a variety of reasons  including the identification of additional facts and circumstances  the complexity of international labor law  developments in the underlying business resulting in the unforeseen reallocation of resources and better or worse than expected settlement discussions 
we record such variances to restructuring expense in the quarter they are identified 
as a result of the above  we recorded a net credit of million back to non recurring compensation and benefits in  after recording a credit of million back to non recurring compensation and benefits in non recurring and restructuring charges by segment the following table displays the net charges incurred by segment for the years ended december   and in millions non recurring restructuring charges investor and occupier services americas europe asia pacific investment management corporate total non recurring and restructuring charges business segments we manage and report our operations as four business segments i investment management  which offers money management services on a global basis  and the three geographic regions of investor and occupier services ios ii americas  iii europe  and iv asia pacific

these corporate global overhead expenses are allocated to the business segments based on the relative revenue of each segment 
our measure of segment operating results excludes non recurring and restructuring charges 
see note for a detailed discussion of these non recurring and restructuring charges

investments in real estate ventures we invest in certain real estate ventures that own and operate commercial real estate 
typically  these are co investments in funds that our investment management business establishes in the ordinary course of business for its clients 
these investments include non controlling ownership interests generally ranging from less than to of the respective ventures 
we apply the provisions of fin r  sop  apb and eitf d when accounting for these interests 
the application of fin r  sop  apb and eitf d generally results in accounting for these interests under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated financial statements due to the nature of our non controlling ownership 
we are generally entitled to operating distributions in accordance with our respective ownership interests 
our exposure to liabilities and losses of these ventures is limited to our existing capital contributions and remaining capital commitments 
for real estate limited partnerships in which the company is a general partner  we apply the guidance set forth in fin r and sop in evaluating the control the company has over the limited partnership 
these entities are generally well capitalized and provide for key decisions to be made by the owners of the entities 
also  the real estate limited partnership agreements grant the limited partners important rights  such as the right to replace the general partner without cause  approve the sale or refinancing of the principal partnership assets  or approve the acquisition of principal partnership assets 
these rights indicate that the company  as general partner  does not have a controlling interest in the limited partnership and accordingly  such general partner interests are accounted for under the equity method 
for real estate limited partnerships in which the company is a limited partner  the company is a co investment partner  and based on applying the guidance set forth in fin r and sop  has concluded that it does not have a controlling interest in the limited partnership 
when we have an asset advisory contract with the real estate limited partnership  the combination of our limited partner interest and the advisory agreement provides us with significant influence over the real estate limited partnership venture 
accordingly  we account for such investments under the equity method 
when the company does not have an asset advisory contract with the limited partnership  rather only a limited partner interest without significant influence  and our interest in the partnership is considered minor under eitf d ie  not more than to percent  we account for such investments under the cost method 
as of december   we had total investments and loans of million in approximately separate property or fund co investments 
with respect to certain co investment indebtedness  in the event that the underlying co investment loans default  we also had repayment guarantees to third party financial institutions of million outstanding at december  following is a table summarizing our investments in real estate ventures in millions percent ownership of real estate limited accounting carrying type of interest partnership venture method value general partner to equity limited partner with advisory agreements to equity equity method limited partner without advisory agreements to cost total lasalle investment company effective january   we established lasalle investment company lic  formerly referred to as lasalle investment limited partnership  a series of four parallel limited partnerships  as our investment vehicle for substantially all new co investments 
lic has  and will continue to  invest in certain real estate ventures that own and operate commercial real estate 
lic generally invests via limited partnerships and intends to own or less of the respective ventures 
our capital commitment to lic is euro million 
through december   we have funded euro million 
therefore  as of december   we have a remaining unfunded commitment of euro million million 
we have an effective ownership interest in lic  primarily institutional investors hold the remaining interest in lic 
in addition  a non executive director of jones lang lasalle is an investor in lic on equivalent terms to other investors 
our investment in lic is accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
at december   lic has unfunded capital commitments of million  of which our share is million  for future fundings of co investments 
we expect that lic will draw down on our commitment over the next five to seven years as it enters into new commitments 
additionally  our board of directors has endorsed the use of our co investment capital in particular situations to control or bridge finance existing real estate assets or portfolios to seed future investment products 
approvals are handled consistently with those of the firm s co investment capital 
the purpose of this is to accelerate capital raising and growth in assets under management 
for the year ended december   we received a net million as the return of capital from co investments exceeded funded co investments  even as performance on capital in the form of equity earnings exceeded operating distributions  increasing investments in and loans to real estate ventures by million to million 
we expect to continue to pursue co investment opportunities with our real estate money management clients in the americas  europe and asia pacific 
co investment remains very important to the continued growth of investment management 
the net co investment funding for is anticipated to be between and million planned co investment less return of capital from liquidated co investments 
in the third quarter of  lic entered into a euro million million revolving credit facility the lic facility principally for its working capital needs 
the lic facility was increased during september to euro million million  and then to euro million million during december the lic facility contains a credit rating trigger related to the credit rating of one of lic s investors who is unaffiliated with jones lang lasalle and a material adverse condition clause 
if either the credit rating trigger or the material adverse condition clause becomes triggered  the lic facility would be in default and would need to be repaid 
this would require us to fund our pro rata share of the then outstanding balance on the lic facility  to which our liability is limited 
the maximum exposure to jones lang lasalle  assuming that the lic facility were fully drawn  would be euro million million 
as of december   lic had euro million million of outstanding borrowings on the lic facility 
at september   lic had euro million million of outstanding borrowings on the lic facility 
certain of these outstanding borrowings were related to bridge financing of a seed portfolio in anticipation of a new fund launch 
due to the ownership structure of lic  we recorded million of these outstanding borrowings in the short term borrowings and investments in and loans to real estate ventures lines of our consolidated balance sheet at september  due to the closing of this new fund during the fourth quarter of  the borrowings were repaid  and as such  these million amounts were not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at december  lic s exposure to liabilities and losses of the ventures is limited to its existing capital contributions and remaining capital commitments

common share purchase rights lasalle hotel properties lho  a real estate investment trust  completed its initial public offering in april we provided advisory  acquisition and administrative services to lho for which we received a base advisory fee calculated as a percentage of net operating income  as well as performance fees based on growth in funds from operations on a per share basis 
such performance fees were paid in the form of lho common stock or units  at our option 
lho was formed with hotels  in which we had a nominal co investment and investment advisory agreement with nine of these hotels 
we contributed our ownership interests in the hotels as well as the related performance fees to lho for an effective ownership interest of approximately  which included certain residual common share purchase rights that gave us the ability to purchase shares in lho at a fixed price 
effective january   the service agreement with lho was terminated and lho became a self managed real estate investment trust 
as a result of the terminated service agreement  we changed our method of accounting for lho to the cost method 
on february   we sold our investment in lho and recognized a gain of million 
we exercised the common share purchase rights during the first and second quarter of  and no longer hold any such rights 
these rights were derivative financial instruments  and as such  we reflected their fair value in our financial statements 
see derivatives and hedging activities in note for a detailed discussion of the accounting treatment of these rights 
debt we have the ability to borrow on our million unsecured revolving credit facility  with authorization to borrow up to an additional million under local facilities 
on april   we renegotiated our unsecured revolving credit facility agreement  increasing the facility from million to million and extending the term to from its previous maturity in there are currently fourteen participating banks in our revolving credit facility 
pricing on this facility ranges from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points dependent upon our leverage ratio 
our current pricing on the revolving credit facility is libor plus basis points 
this amended facility will continue to be utilized for working capital needs  investments and acquisitions 
on june   we utilized the revolving credit facility to redeem all of the outstanding euro notes at a redemption price of of principal 
we incurred pre tax expense of million  which includes the premiums paid million to redeem the euro notes and the acceleration of debt issuance cost amortization million 
the redemption of the euro notes provided savings of approximately million in  as the credit facility s pricing was favorable compared to the euro notes which carried a interest rate 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we also had short term borrowings including capital lease obligations of million outstanding at december  the short term borrowings are primarily borrowings by subsidiaries on various interest bearing overdraft facilities 
as of december   million of the total short term borrowings were attributable to local overdraft facilities 
jones lang lasalle and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we guarantee the local overdraft facilities of certain subsidiaries 
third party lenders request these guarantees to ensure payment by the company in the event that one of our subsidiaries fails to repay its borrowing on an overdraft facility 
the guarantees typically have one year or two year maturities 
we apply fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  to recognize and measure the provisions of guarantees 
the guarantees of the revolving credit facility and local overdraft facilities do not meet the recognition provisions  but do meet the disclosure requirements of fin we have local overdraft facilities totaling million  of which million was outstanding as of december  we have provided guarantees of million related to the local overdraft facilities  as well as guarantees related to the million revolving credit facility  which in total represent the maximum future payments that jones lang lasalle could be required to make under the guarantees provided for subsidiaries third party debt 
with respect to the amended revolving credit facility  we must maintain a consolidated net worth of at least million and a leverage ratio not exceeding to we must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of to as part of the renegotiation of the revolving credit facility  the leverage ratio was revised to provide more flexibility  as we eliminated the fixed coverage ratio that existed in the previous agreement 
we are in compliance with all covenants at december  additionally  we are restricted from  among other things  incurring certain levels of indebtedness to lenders outside of the facilities and disposing of a significant portion of our assets 
lender approval is required for certain levels of co investment as well as capital expenditures 
the revolving credit facility bears variable rates of interest based on market rates 
we are authorized to use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the floating rate indebtedness to a fixed rate  however  none were used during or and none were outstanding as of december  the effective interest rate on our debt was in  compared to in the decrease in the effective interest rate is due to a change in the mix of our average borrowings being less heavily weighted towards the higher coupon euro notes  as the euro notes were redeemed in june overall  the continued strong cash flow of the company is being used to reduce borrowings at higher market interest rates 
leases we lease office space in various buildings for our own use 
the terms of these non cancelable operating leases provide for us to pay base rent and a share of increases in operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of defined amounts

if repatriation of all such earnings were to occur  and if we were unable to utilize foreign tax credits due to the limitations of us tax law  we estimate our maximum resulting us tax liability would be million  net of the benefits of utilization of us federal and state carryovers

valuation allowances have been provided with regard to the tax benefit of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and us capital loss carryforwards  for which we have concluded that recognition is not yet appropriate under sfas no

we maintain several defined contribution retirement plans for our eligible non us employees 
our contributions to these plans were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in contributions in and is due to the january curtailment of the united kingdom defined benefit pension plan and the implementation of a defined contribution plan

it is our policy to fund the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations

recognizing the value of excess return over long term interest rates in terms of the potential for reducing costs and improving benefits  a competitive rate of return is sought relative to an appropriate level of risk in managing the plan assets portfolio

at december   as a result of the return on plan assets and our pound sterling million million contribution to the plan  the fair value of our uk pension plan assets were greater than our accumulated benefit obligation under the plan 
as required  we removed our minimum pension liability 
under local laws and regulations we were not currently required to fund the plan 
however  given our current intent to ensure that the plan remains funded to a reasonable level  we contributed pound sterling million million to the plan in the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of we identified that the accumulated benefit obligation of the ireland defined benefit plan exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by million 
as a result of this  in the third quarter of we recorded a minimum pension liability consisting of million of excess accumulated benefit obligation  plus the value of the prepaid pension asset of million  net of an intangible asset of  established to record the unrecognized prior service cost 
the adjustment to reflect the required minimum pension liability of million  net of associated tax benefit of  was recorded through other comprehensive income in the third quarter of at december   the fair value of this plan s assets were greater than the accumulated benefit obligation  therefore  no minimum pension liability was required and all amounts recorded were reversed in the fourth quarter of stock option and stock compensation plans stock award and incentive plan the jones lang lasalle amended and restated stock award and incentive plan saip provides for the granting of options to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock and for other stock awards to eligible employees of jones lang lasalle

 business combinations sfas  when accounting for business combinations 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet certain criteria to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
the americas ios business completed two acquisitions during as a result of these acquisitions  as of december  we have paid purchase consideration of million  recorded liabilities for future purchase consideration of million  recorded million of goodwill with indefinite useful lives  and recorded million of intangibles with definite useful lives  which represents the value of contracts acquired as part of the business acquisition 
the acquisitions include certain earn out and retention provisions that may ultimately impact the actual amounts that will be paid 
we apply sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  when accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead evaluated for impairment at least annually 
to accomplish this annual evaluation  we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of evaluation 
under sfas  we define reporting units as investment management  americas ios  australia ios  asia ios  and by country groupings in europe ios 
we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit on the basis of a discounted cash flow methodology and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
the result of the and evaluations was that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  and therefore we did not recognize an impairment loss in either year 
we have million of unamortized intangibles and goodwill as of december  that are subject to the provisions of sfas a significant portion of these unamortized intangibles and goodwill are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  which means that a portion of the movements in the reported book value of these balances are attributable to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the tables below set forth further details on the foreign exchange impact on intangible and goodwill balances 
of the million of unamortized intangibles and goodwill  million represents goodwill with indefinite useful lives  which we ceased amortizing beginning january  the remaining million of identifiable intangibles principally representing management contracts acquired will be amortized over their remaining definite useful lives

as discussed in note  we apply fin to recognize and measure the provisions of these guarantees 
the million of guarantees represents the maximum future payments that jones lang lasalle could be required to make under such guarantees 
these guarantees relate to collateralized borrowings by project level entities  and certain of the guarantees have terms extending out until repayment could be requested by the third party lenders in the event that one of the project level entities fails to repay its borrowing 
we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 
we are a defendant in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business  some of which involve claims for damages that are substantial in amount 
many of these litigation matters are covered by insurance including insurance provided through a captive insurance company  although they may nevertheless be subject to large deductibles or retentions and the amounts being claimed may exceed the available insurance 
although the ultimate liability for these matters cannot be determined  based upon information currently available  we believe the ultimate resolution of such claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
on november   bank one na bank one filed suit against the company and certain of its subsidiaries in the circuit court of cook county  illinois with regard to services provided in and under three different agreements relating to facility management  project development and broker services 
the suit alleged negligence  breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty on the part of jones lang lasalle and sought million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
on december   the company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract seeking payment of approximately million that bank one owes for fees due for services provided under the agreements 
on december   the court granted the company s motion to strike the complaint because after completion of significant discovery  bank one had been unable to substantiate its allegations that it suffered damages of million as it had previously claimed 
bank one filed an amended complaint that seeks to recover compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages 
the amended complaint also includes allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation  fraudulent concealment and conversion 
in november  in response to the company s motion for partial summary judgment  the court dismissed six of the ten counts of bank one s amended complaint  including claims of breach of fiduciary duty 
remaining are counts for breach of contract  fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment 
the company continues to aggressively defend the remaining counts of the suit and pursue its claims 
while there can be no assurance  the company continues to believe that the remaining counts of the amended complaint are without merit and  as such  will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in addition  as a result of the recent rulings and information produced in discovery  any recoverable damages claims are substantially reduced from bank one s initial claims 
as of the date of this report  no trial date has been set 
as such  although we still have not seen or heard anything that leads us to believe that the suit has merit  the outcome of bank one s suit cannot be predicted with any certainty and management is unable to estimate an amount or range of potential loss that could result if an improbable unfavorable outcome did occur 
quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of earnings data for each of our last eight quarters 
in our opinion  this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments and accruals  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation 
the unaudited consolidated quarterly information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as well as the summary of critical accounting policies and estimates section within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
we would note the following points regarding how we prepare and present our financial statements on a periodic basis 
periodic accounting for incentive compensation an important part of our overall compensation package is incentive compensation  which is typically paid out to employees in the first quarter of the year after it is earned 
in our interim financial statements we accrue for incentive compensation based on the percentage of revenue and compensation costs recorded to date relative to forecasted revenue and compensation costs for the full year as substantially all incentive compensation pools are based upon revenues and profits 
the impact of this incentive compensation accrual methodology is that we accrue very little incentive compensation in the first six months of the year  with the majority of our incentive compensation accrued in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
we adjust the incentive compensation accrual in those unusual cases where earned incentive compensation has been paid to employees 
in addition  we exclude from the standard accrual methodology incentive compensation pools that are not subject to the normal performance criteria 
these pools are accrued for on a straight line basis 
certain employees receive a portion of their incentive compensation in the form of restricted stock units of our common stock 
we recognize this compensation over the vesting period of these restricted stock units  which has the effect of deferring a portion of current year incentive compensation to later years 
previously we accounted for the current year impact of this program in the fourth quarter namely  the enhancement  the deferral and the related amortization because of the uncertainty around the terms and conditions of the stock ownership program and because the majority of our incentive compensation is accrued in the fourth quarter 
due to the maturity of the program and the commitment to its terms and conditions by the company and the compensation committee of the board of directors  we began accounting for the earned portion of this compensation program on a quarterly basis  starting in the third quarter of we recognize the benefit of the stock ownership program in a manner consistent with the accrual of the underlying incentive compensation expense 
the following table reflects the credit recorded to the income statement for the earned portion of the stock ownership program for each period in and in millions three months ended march  six months ended june  nine months ended september  twelve months ended december  common share purchase rights in connection with a previous investment in an unconsolidated real estate venture  we were granted certain residual common share purchase rights that gave us the ability to purchase shares in a publicly traded real estate investment trust at a fixed price 
these rights  which extended through april  were a non hedging derivative instrument and should have been recorded at fair value as part of the adoption of sfas effective january   with subsequent changes in fair value reflected in equity earnings 
the initial accounting for these common share purchase rights through june  was not in accordance with the rules of sfas due to an inadvertent error as a result of the complexity of this unique derivative 
the fair value of these common share purchase rights was recorded in the third quarter of we determined fair value through the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of these rights at january  was  and the fair value has ranged from  to million in the periods since that time due to stock market fluctuation 
at december   the fair value of these rights was million  which we included in the investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million in equity earnings in the third quarter of  of which approximately  represented the impact of correcting this error 
during the first quarter of  market conditions became favorable for us to begin disposing of these common share purchase rights  and we made the disposition during the first and second quarters of we no longer hold any such rights  and we do not own any other instruments of this nature 
we do not believe that the correction of this error is material to the  or consolidated financial statements or in any quarter of these years 
additionally  we do not believe that the correction of this error is material to consolidated earnings trends 
income taxes we provide for the effects of income taxes on interim financial statements based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year 
we assess our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis and reflect the benefit from tax planning actions when we believe it is probable they will be successful  which usually requires that certain actions have been initiated 
we account for the cumulative catch up impact of any change in estimated effective tax rate in the quarter that a change is made 
the effective tax rate we applied to recurring operations for and was as follows three months ended march  six months ended june  nine months ended september  twelve months ended december  seasonality historically  our revenue  operating income and net earnings in the first three calendar quarters are substantially lower than in the fourth quarter 
other than for the investment management segment  this seasonality is due to a calendar year end focus on the completion of real estate transactions  which is consistent with the real estate industry generally 
our investment management segment earns performance fees on clients returns on their real estate investments 
such performance fees are generally earned when assets are sold  the timing of which is geared towards the benefit of our clients 
non variable operating expenses  which are treated as expenses when they are incurred during the year  are relatively constant on a quarterly basis
