the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview we completed our initial public offering on july   and therefore have no prior periods with which to compare operating results for the twelve months ended june  as of june   we continue to pursue our investment strategy and of our net assets are invested in energy companies  with the remainder invested in us government and money market securities 
we invest in companies in the energy industry  most of which have relatively short or no operating histories 
these companies are and will be subject to all of the business risk and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise  including the risk that these companies may not reach their investment objective and the value of our investment in them may decline substantially or fall to zero 
as of june  our portfolio generated an annualized current yield of across all our long term debt and equity investments 
this yield includes interest from all of our long term investments as well as dividends from gas solutions holdings  inc gshi and unity virginia holdings 
we expect this number to decline over time as we become fully invested 
monetization of  or dividends from  other equity positions that we hold is not included in this yield estimate 
in each of our portfolio companies  we hold equity positions  ranging from minority interests to majority stakes  which we expect over time to contribute significantly to our investment returns 
many of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rate of returns  preferred distributions  flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns  as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity  in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections 
unlike a traditional mezzanine portfolio that may be characterized by deep subordination  minimal or no collateral  long term maturities  no amortization and limited covenants  our portfolio consists of first and second mortgages and liens  hard asset collateral  two to five year average durations  amortizing positions and strong covenants 
our collateral consists of assets such as receivables  inventory  natural gas reserves  crude oil reserves  coal reserves  pipelines  processing plants  oilfield equipment  rolling stock and other hard assets 
results of operations investment activity we completed our first fiscal year and fourth quarter  which was our third full quarter since completion of our initial public offering on july   with approximately of our net assets invested in obligations of the united states treasury  or about million in six long term portfolio investments  and in a money market fund 
the remaining was comprised of in the segregated account described below and in liabilities in excess of other assets 
long term portfolio investments during the quarter ended june   we completed three new investments totaling approximately million in stryker energy ii  llc stryker  whymore coal company whymore  and miller petroleum  inc miller 
on april   we provided million in financing to stryker 
the stryker financing is comprised of two facilities million in senior secured debt and million of preferred equity 
stryker is a gas production company based in cleveland  ohio 
stryker focuses on high grade  low risk development drilling and production in the appalachian basin 
gas from the appalachian basin typically sells at a premium to gas produced on the us gulf coast because of its proximity to the heating and power generation markets in the northeastern united states 
stryker already has drilled and completed more than wells  with a multi year inventory of development locations which we expect to lead to additional collateral and growth in the future 
on  september   we provided an additional million of senior secured debt financing to stryker 
on april   we provided million in senior secured debt financing to whymore coal company whymore 
whymore is a coal production company based in london  kentucky  and a member of kentucky s small operator assistance program  which provides benefits to operators with good reclamation histories 
whymore owns more than million tons of estimated proven surface coal reserves across acres in the river gem  dewitt  hubbs creek  and hooker branch mining areas of southern kentucky in knox and whitley counties 
whymore also has rights to mine on an additional  acres 
much of the reserve base is already permitted 
our investment is secured by equipment and mineral assets  and has attached preferred equity participation rights 
whymore is producing coal from two separate coal seams  the river gem and dewitt  and has contractually arranged to sell all its current coal for fixed prices through the first two years of production after our initial funding in april on august   we provided an additional  of senior secured debt financing to whymore for which we also received additional equity in this company 
on september   we further provided an additional  of senior secured debt financing to whymore for which we further received additional equity in this company 
on may   we provided million in senior secured debt financing to miller 
miller is an oil and gas production company based in huntsville  tennessee with  gross acres under lease in the heart of tennessee s appalachian basin 
since  miller has built a track record spanning years in this basin s oil and gas industry 
miller s production and acreage position consists of the jellico  lindsay  koppers north  koppers south and harriman fields 
miller currently has more than producing wells 
we made this investment together with an investment of million by petro capital advisors  llc petro capital of dallas  texas 
the funding was utilized to repay existing debt and to fund additional development drilling 
we and petro capital received warrants in miller as part of our respective investments 
our investment in gshi is comprised of million in subordinated secured debt and of the common equity shares million 
gshi owns and operates a major gas gathering system in the east texas field in gregg  upshur and rusk counties texas  as well as a smaller system in smith county texas  both of which support two processing facilities  the longview plant and the chapel hill plant 
the east texas field has been producing oil and gas continuously since and is believed to be one of the largest oil reservoirs in north america 
with approximately  miles of pipeline  gshi owns and operates the only gathering system in the chapel hill area 
gshi completed construction and started operation of the mile exxon hawkins ngl pipeline connecting the exxon hawkins gas plant to gshi on june  deliveries for the month of june averaged barrels per day and are expected to exceed  barrels per day by the end of the agreement with exxon gas power marketing company exxon is effective as of june  and has a term of seven years with an annual renewal provision thereafter 
under the agreement  exxon is to deliver a specified minimum number of barrels of natural gas liquids in the first five years and to pay a transportation  treating and fractionation fee which includes a capital recovery component 
after five years or delivery of the specified minimum number of barrels  the fee decreases to a base transportation  treating and fractionation rate for the remainder of the contract term 
the company has provided a limited indemnity to citibank texas  na related to citibank s term loan to gshi 
the limited indemnity requires us to indemnify citibank for up to million if it realizes losses on the term loan 
this limited indemnity is backed by segregated funds in prospect energy s account valued at million 
during the quarter ended june   million of previously segregated funds were released to the company 
this reduction reflects quarterly payments by gshi to citibank texas  na these funds are released upon the earlier of final legal resolution of such claims  should any be made  or days after the loan with citibank texas  na is refinanced or otherwise repaid 
on december   dallas gas partners  lp dgp served prospect energy with a complaint filed november  in the united states district for the southern district of texas  galveston division 
dgp alleges that dgp was defrauded and that prospect energy breached its fiduciary duty to dgp and tortuously interfered with dgp s contract to purchase gas solutions  ltd 
a subsidiary of our portfolio company  gshi in connection with prospect energy s alleged agreement in september  to loan dgp funds with which dgp intended to buy gas solutions  ltd 
for approximately million 
the complaint seeks relief not limited to million note 
we believe that the dgp complaint is frivolous and without merit  and intend to defend the matter vigorously 
however  as with any litigation  the outcome is uncertain and a judgment against prospect energy could significantly impair the value of the investment in gas solutions holdings  inc gshi has indemnified prospect energy against any legal action arising from its investment in gas solutions  lp 
prospect energy has incurred approximately million in fees associated with this legal action through june  gshi has reimbursed prospect energy million as of june  prospect energy has a receivable from gshi of approximately million as of june  the million reimbursement is reflected as dividend income  gas solutions holdings  inc on the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended june  our investment in unity virginia holdings llc uvh is comprised of two facilities million in secured subordinated debt and million in redeemable preferred stock 
uvh is a coal mining company located near norton  virginia 
uvh is owned by the principals of unity platform llc unity  a dallas based coal management and private investment firm with interests in operating us coal mines 
capital from the transaction was utilized to support uvh s acquisition and development of certain assets of appalachian resources  inc ari  including  acres of mineral reserves which contain million estimated tons of coal  as well as a coal preparation plant and load out facility on the norfolk southern railway 
uvh continues to actively pursue its business plan and has made satisfactory progress since our investment was made  including the opening of a new surface mine  identifying additional reserves  and beginning the development of its first underground mine 
the preparation plant and material handling facilities are now fully operational and coal is being processed and shipped 
saleable quantities of metallurgical coal began being mined and marketed during may 
if demand and pricing for coal remain at or near current levels in both the domestic and export markets  we believe that uvh can attain strong operating margins in these operations 
we invested million as senior secured debt financing to natural gas systems  inc otc bb ngsy ngs  an oil and gas production company based in houston  texas with operations in louisiana 
in conjunction with our loan  we received a total of  non revocable warrants and  revocable warrants with an exercise price of cents per share 
ngs acquires and develops oil and gas fields  applying both conventional and specialized technology to accelerate production and develop incremental reserves in those fields 
the company currently maintains a working interest in the delhi and tullos urania fields in central and northern louisiana 
we classify our investments by level of control 
as defined in the act  control investments are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company 
control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual owns more than or more of the voting securities of an investee company 
affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through ownership of or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person 
we neither control nor are we affiliated with either unity virginia holdings  llc  stryker energy ii  llc  whymore coal company  natural gas systems  inc  or miller petroleum  inc 
the company owns of the outstanding common equity shares of gshi and  therefore  has a controlling interest 
we currently have a number of transactions in our pipeline 
our investment adviser continues to conduct due diligence and finalize terms regarding further transactions 
however  we can offer no assurance as to when or if any of these transactions will close 
investment income we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own  dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own  and capital gains or losses on any debt or equity securities that we acquire in portfolio companies and subsequently sell 
our investments  if in the form of debt securities  will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
to the extent achievable  we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies assets 
we also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies  which may pay cash or in kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis 
in addition  we may generate revenue in other forms including commitment  origination  structuring or due diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance  and possibly consultation fees 
any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned 
investment income  which consists of interest income and dividend income  was million and for the twelve months ended june  and for the period from april  inception through june   respectively 
interest income increased by quarter over quarter as a result of interest received from additional portfolio investments in stryker energy ii  miller petroleum  and whymore coal made during the quarter and described earlier 
the remaining investment income during the twelve months ended june  was generated primarily from investments in short term united states treasury bills and cash equivalents 
operating expenses our primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory fees  legal and professional fees and other operating and overhead related expenses 
these expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement with prospect administration under which prospect administration provides administrative services and facilities for prospect energy 
our investment advisory fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with our administration agreement with prospect administration 
operating expenses were million and million for the twelve months ended june  and for the period from april  inception through june   respectively 
these expenses consisted of investment advisory and administrative services fees  professional fees  insurance expenses  directors fees and other general and administrative expenses 
the base investment advisory fees were million and for the twelve months ended june  and for the period from april  inception through june   respectively 
no incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the investment advisory agreement 
legal and professional fees were higher during the twelve months ended june  than we would expect in future periods due to the occurrence of certain items and their associated costs which we would not expect to occur at this level in the future 
these items include consultation and preparation of initial corporate documents and compliance and procedural manuals  costs associated with an internal investigation  tax compliance consultation and analysis  sarbanes oxley act of related matters  and litigation related costs 
net investment income  net unrealized appreciation and net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations prospect energy s net investment income loss was million and million for the twelve months ended june  and for the period from april  inception through june   respectively 
net investment income represents the difference between investment income and operating expenses and is directly impacted by the items described above 
net unrealized appreciation was million and during the twelve months ended june  and for the period from april  inception through june   respectively  primarily as a result of the increase in fair value of our investment in gshi 
this increase in fair value reflects the general increase in energy prices and the impact on our portfolio companies 
net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations represents the sum of the returns generated from net investment income  realized gains losses and from unrealized appreciation depreciation 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we generated million in cash from the net proceeds of our initial offering 
we also generated million in net investment income investment income less operating expenses 
we declared and paid million in quarterly dividends 
in the future  we may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks  issuances of senior securities or secondary offerings 
we may also securitize a portion of our investments in mezzanine or senior secured loans or other assets 
our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
at june   we had million in cash held in a segregated account in conjunction with a limited indemnity issued to citibank texas  na formerly first american bank  ssb 
the limited indemnity with citibank requires us to indemnify citibank for up to million if it realizes with respect to realized losses on its term loan resulting only from potential legal claims that might or could be asserted by certain third parties 
during the quarter ended june   million of previously segregated funds were released to the company 
this reduction reflects quarterly payments by gshi to citibank texas  na these funds are to be released after the earlier of final legal resolution of such claims  should any be made  or days after the citibank loan is refinanced or otherwise repaid 
our investment pace is difficult to estimate and has tended to occur in batches  with both the number of deals each month and the size of such deals having a wide range of possible outcomes 
preliminary investment terms might be outlined with counterparties in a potential transaction  but such potential transaction might not be consummated for due diligence or other factors  as has been the case from time to time in the past 
we continue to target investing million to million on average per month  in line with our historical activity 
we are pleased with the quantity and quality of our potential transaction flow  which has continued to build over the year since our initial public offering 
regulated investment company status we elected an august st fiscal year end for income tax reporting purposes  commencing with the initial taxable year ended august  our fiscal year end for financial reporting purposes will remain june th 
the company has qualified and elected to be subject to taxation as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code for the taxable year ended august  as long as the company continues to qualify as a regulated investment company  the company will not be subject to tax on its investment company taxable income or its net capital gains  to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed  or deemed to be distributed  as dividends to our stockholders on a timely basis 
certain investments in the partnerships  limited liability companies  joint ventures and other pass through entities common in the energy industry can create enhanced risks of failing to comply with the requirements applicable to regulated investment companies under the code 
dividends and distributions declared and paid to stockholders may differ from net income for financial reporting and taxable fiscal years due to the timing of recognition of income and expenses  realization of gains and losses  occurrence of a return of capital  and or net realized appreciation or depreciation in investments  which may not be included in taxable income 
to remain in compliance with subchapter m of the code with respect to the company s taxable year  the company is generally required to maintain its status as a business development company in accordance with the act  derive at least of its gross income from dividends  interest  gains from the sales of securities and other specified types of income required under subchapter m of the code  satisfy certain asset diversification requirements as defined in subchapter m of the code  and distribute to stockholders at least of the company s investment company taxable income as defined in subchapter m of the code 
however  we offer no assurance that we will continue to qualify for such treatment in future taxable years 
if we fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  we would be subject to corporate level taxes on our taxable income  whether or not such taxable income is distributed to our stockholders 
the imposition of corporate level taxes on us would substantially reduce the amount of income available for distribution to our stockholders 
even if we qualify as a regulated investment company for any taxable year in question  we would be subject to corporate level income tax on any income not distributed to our stockholders 
moreover  we would be subject to a  entity level excise tax  for any calendar year in which we do not distribute an amount equal to or exceeding the sum of of our calendar year ordinary income and of our capital gain net income for the one year period ended october st  computed in accordance with section of the code 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or  gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ 
the following are significant accounting policies consistently applied by prospect energy we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements 
so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and they are consistently applied by us investments a security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis 
b valuation investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
short term investments which mature in days or less  such as united states treasury bills  are valued at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
the amortized cost method involves valuing a security at its cost on the date of purchase and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of the difference between the principal amount due at maturity and cost 
short term securities which mature in more than days are valued at current market quotations by an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers if available  or otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
investments in money market mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of business on the day of valuation 
it is expected that most of the investments in the company s portfolio will not have readily available market values 
debt and equity securities whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value  with the assistance of an independent valuation service  using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process which is under the direction of our board of directors 
the factors that may be taken into account in fairly valuing investments include  as relevant  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its estimated earnings and projected discounted cash flows  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the sensitivity of the investments to fluctuations in interest rates  the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates  comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies and other relevant factors 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of these investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments  and any such differences could be material 
on december   dallas gas partners  lp dgp served prospect energy with a complaint filed november  in the united states district for the southern district of texas  galveston division 
dgp alleges that dgp was defrauded and that prospect energy breached its fiduciary duty to dgp and tortiously interfered with dgp s contract to purchase gas solutions  ltd 
a subsidiary of our portfolio company  gshi in connection with prospect energy s alleged agreement in september  to loan dgp funds with which dgp intended to buy gas solutions  ltd 
for approximately million 
the complaint seeks relief not limited to million 
we believe that the dgp complaint is frivolous and without merit  and intend to defend the matter vigorously 
however  as with any litigation  the outcome is uncertain and a judgment against prospect energy could significantly impair the value of the investment in gas solutions holdings  inc off balance sheet arrangements prospect energy currently engages in no off balance sheet arrangements including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices

on august   we provided an additional million of senior secured debt financing to whymore for which we also received additional equity in this company 
on september   we further provided an additional million of senior secured debt financing to whymore for which we further received additional equity in this company 
on september   we provided an additional million of senior secured debt financing to stryker 
on september  we provided million of senior secured debt financing to worcester energy partners  inc weco  a wood processing and biomass power generation business based in deblois  maine

built in  the plant has operated intermittently over the past decade and recently has been recommissioned for baseload operations 
the wood harvesting and chipping business has access to more than  acres of wood fuel  and the plant has long term contracts for the sale of electricity as well as renewable energy credits 
prospect s funding has been utilized to refinance existing debt and to provide working capital to re initiate plant operations 
prospect is receiving a significant equity ownership position in weco as part of the investment  including a minimum internal rate of return on prospect s investment 
we expect that these four investments  in the aggregate  will contribute approximately per share to interest income on a quarterly basis  provided that all interest payments are made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of our financing agreements with these three companies 
hurricanes katrina and rita did not directly affect the production of our oil and gas portfolio companies as none of our portfolio companies have offshore production in the waters around louisiana and texas 
rising commodity prices  in part  based on hurricanes katrina and rita  and in part  based on other macroeconomic supply and demand factors  have recently tended to benefit upstream related portfolio companies 
however  our risk management hedging covenants with our portfolio companies attempt to reduce commodity risk for currently producing assets 
contractual obligations the company has purchase obligations for investment advisory and administrative services 
such descriptions may be found under investment advisory agreement page and administration agreement page  respectively 
the company paid million for investment advisory services and million thousand for administrative services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  equity price risk and some of the loans in our portfolio may have floating rates 
to date  a significant  but declining  percentage of our assets have been and are invested in short term us treasury bills 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the twelve months ended june   we did not engage directly in hedging activities 
see f of the financial statements for tabular information regarding the interest rate and equity price risk on our investments
