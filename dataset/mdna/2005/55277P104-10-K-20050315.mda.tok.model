item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general mge energy is a holding company operating through subsidiaries in three business segments electric utility operations  gas utility operations  and nonregulated energy operations 
our principal subsidiary is mge  which conducts our electric utility and gas utility operations 
mge generates and distributes electricity to nearly  customers in dane county  wisconsin  including the city of madison  and purchases and distributes natural gas to nearly  customers in the wisconsin counties of columbia  crawford  dane  iowa  juneau  monroe  and vernon 
other subsidiaries  which constitute our nonregulated energy operations  have been formed to own and construct new electric generating capacity 
those subsidiaries are currently undertaking the construction of a mw  electricity  steam  and chilled water cogeneration facility on the uw madison campus 
we became the holding company for mge on august   when mge shareholders exchanged their shares of mge common stock for shares of our common stock 
the share exchange had no accounting effect on mge s recorded assets  liabilities  revenues  or expenses 
mge s electric and gas utility operations represent a substantial part of our assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
our nonregulated operations  relating to the development of a cogeneration project on the uw madison campus  are limited to service fees received from the state by mge construct as the facility remains under construction 
operations on this facility are expected to begin during the second quarter of consequently  the following discussion focuses mainly on the results of operations and financial condition of mge 
executive summary in  our utility operations experienced an increase in electric and gas revenues 
additionally  operation and maintenance expenses increased due to higher fees for outside professional services due to the sarbanes oxley act  higher distribution costs  and higher overall customer service and administrative costs 
this increase was slightly offset by lower pension and benefit expenses  lower transmission expenses  and a decrease in interest expense as a result of generally lower levels of short and long term debt during the latter portion of our liquidity and capital position remained strong during on september   mge energy completed the sale of  shares of common stock at a net sale price of per share 
the company s proceeds  net of underwriters fees and other expenses  were approximately million 
these funds were utilized to repay short term borrowing incurred during the year to finance the construction of wccf and for general corporate purposes 
we anticipate relying on short and long term borrowings to support the remaining construction and capital expenditures for the cogeneration facility that mge power west campus is constructing on the uw madison campus 
our primary focus today and for the foreseeable future is our core utility customers at mge 
mge continues to face the challenge of providing its customers with reliable power at competitive prices 
it plans to meet this challenge by building more efficient generation projects and continuing its efforts to control its operational costs 
we believe it is critical to continue maintaining a strong credit standing and financial strength in mge as well as the parent company in order to accomplish these goals 
results of operations earnings overview mge energy in  our earnings were million  or per share 
gas retail deliveries declined slightly  but retail electric sales increased 
mge s increase in base rates to cover  in large part rising fuel costs  led to an increase in utility revenues 
operations and maintenance costs increased due to higher fees for outside professional services  overall customer service and administrative costs  and higher distribution costs 
during  mge energy benefited from lower pension and benefit expenses  lower transmission costs  and decreased interest costs due to lower levels of short and long term debt during the latter portion of in  our earnings were million  or per share 
electric retail sales declined slightly  but retail gas deliveries increased 
during  mge s increase in base rates  which were primarily due to rising fuel costs  led to an increase in utility revenues 
operations and maintenance costs increased due to higher costs for employee benefits health care  pension  etc  transmission wheeling charges  distribution costs  and maintenance 
these costs were somewhat offset by a decrease in depreciation costs  as mge was no longer required to contribute to the decommissioning fund for kewaunee in also  mge energy benefited from lower interest costs due to refinancing a large portion of its long term debt in  and the lower interest rates on its variable rate and short term debt in in  mge energy s earnings were million  or per share 
mge s increase in electric retail sales  coupled with an increase in base rates to cover rising fuel costs  contributed to a increase in electric revenues 
purchased power costs increased substantially 
was the first full year mge purchased mw of capacity and energy to replace its share of generation lost from kewaunee 
mge sold its interest in kewaunee to wpsc in september as a result  mge s operations and maintenance costs were lower in mge s gas margin increased million  due to growth in gas deliveries 
electric utility operations electric sales and revenues the following table compares mge s electric retail revenues and electric kwh sales by customer class during each of the years ended december in thousands revenues kwh sales residential       commercial       industrial       other retail municipal       total retail       sales for resale      other revenues   total       cooling degree days normal electric operating revenues were up and in and  due to the following in millions rate changes sales for resale volume other effects total rates 
the pscw authorized increases in mge s electric rates effective january   to cover rising fuel costs and increased system demands 
in  mge recorded a reduction to electric revenues of million  to reflect a fuel credit refund due to customers as a result of a pscw proceeding initiated on august  of this amount  million has been included in customers bills and million was refunded to customers in january the retail revenues reflect a fuel credit in the amount of million 
of this amount  million was reflected in customers bills and million was refunded to customers in the first quarter of an additional million was recorded and refunded to customers in january  related to the proceedings 
the liability for this fuel credit was previously accrued from august through january  as a decrease to other electric revenues 
the pscw also authorized increases in mge s electric rates effective march   and january   to cover rising fuel costs  increased system demands  and the installation of an amr system 
revenues in also reflect a surcharge of on electric rates  effective october   and ending october   which the pscw authorized to recover deferred costs associated with forming atc and ongoing incremental transmission costs 
volume 
during  there was a increase in total retail sales volumes 
this increase is primarily attributable to additional commercial and industrial users coming on line in  and business growth at some of mge s preexisting  large commercial and industrial users 
in  electric retail sales volumes decreased due to cooler than normal summer temperatures 
other effects 
other electric revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to the reversal of the fuel credit liability  which was refunded to customers in the first quarter of in  the fuel credit liability was recorded in other electric revenues 
however  the fuel credit liability was allocated directly to the appropriate customer classes rather than in other electric effects 
the actual fuel refund decreased retail revenues and is offset by an increase in other electric revenues 
sales for resale 
during  sales for resale decreased million 
the decrease in sales for resale represents lower sales volume due to the expiration of a contract with alliant to sell mw of electric capacity 
the contract was in effect from january through august sales for resale also includes transactions conducted on the pjm market since the establishment and involvement in the pjm market on may  on may   pjm began managing the flow of wholesale electricity over comed transmission lines and administering open  competitive wholesale electricity trading markets 
mge has three purchase power agreements that are impacted by comed s integration in the pjm market 
mge has recorded certain transactions on the pjm market on a net basis resulting in a million reduction to sales for resale and purchased power expense for the year ended december  electric fuel and purchased power in  fuel used for electric generation increased million  or  compared to this increase is due to an increase in the year to date electric generation at mge s baseload plants million and a slight increase in rates million 
mge s internal generation increased during  when compared to  mainly due to a increase during the first quarter of this large increase was the result of the columbia facility being off line during a portion of the first quarter of  but back on line for the first quarter of the per unit cost of internal generation increased for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in the prior year 
purchased power expense increased by million  or  for  compared to this increase represents a increase in the per unit cost offset by a decrease in the volume of purchased power 
these fluctuations include a million reduction to purchased power expense in  which resulted from the netting of transactions in the pjm market in which we were buying and selling power within the same period to meet our electric energy delivery requirements 
in  fuel used for electric generation increased million  or  primarily due to a rise in the cost of natural gas used at certain mge generating plants 
mge s internal generation increased in purchased power expense increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in the cost of natural gas million 
the average price for purchased power was per mwh in  compared to in  an increase of 
the increase in purchased power expense was partially offset by a decrease in volume million resulting from the expiration of a mw purchased power agreement with wpsc in september electric operating expenses electric operating expense decreased million  or  in  and increased million  or  in the following changes contributed to the net change in electric operating expenses for the indicated year in millions decreased increased transmission costs amortization of deferred costs related to atc decreased increased health and pension expenses increased distribution costs increased regulatory expenses due to filing a cpcn for authority to build wccf increased outside professional services increased miscellaneous steam power expenses decreased increased other general and administrative expenses decreased customer services  promotions  and account costs total electric operating expenses maintenance expense in  electric maintenance expense increased million  or 
this is primarily due to an increase in the maintenance of production assets  including turbine and generator overhauls million 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in maintenance of distribution assets 
in  electric maintenance expense increased million  or 
this increase is due to the following factors increase in maintenance of distribution assets million  including substation work  transformers  and overhead and underground lines 
maintenance and system upgrades help to improve the reliability of mge s electric distribution system 
increase in other maintenance sources  including electric generating assets and columbia million 
depreciation electric depreciation expense increased million in  and decreased million in the increase in electric depreciation expense in reflects higher levels of electric plant assets 
the decrease in electric depreciation expense reflects lower decommissioning expense million as a result of the sale of kewaunee  offset in part by million of increased depreciation associated with an increase in electric plant assets 
gas utility operations gas deliveries and revenues the following table compares mge s gas retail revenues and gas delivered by customer class during each of the years ended december in thousands revenues therms delivered residential       commercial industrial       total retail       gas transportation       other revenues    total       heating degree days normal     gas revenues increased in and in due to the following in millions gas costs rates gas deliveries gas transportation other effects total average rate per therm of residential customers gas costs rates 
the pscw authorized increases in mge s gas rates effective january   and march   to cover increased system demands 
gas costs increased significantly in both and the average rate per therm for residential customers in increased 
additionally in  the average rate per therm for residential customers increased 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on gas base rates 
retail gas deliveries 
in  retail gas deliveries decreased 
this decrease is attributable to warmer than normal temperatures as reflected by the decrease in heating degree days 
in  there was a increase in retail gas deliveries 
this increase was due to colder than normal temperatures  as reflected in the increase in heating degree days 
gas transportation 
in and  there was a and decrease in deliveries  respectively 
these decreases represent customers switching from gas to other fuel options  due to the higher price of gas 
other effects 
other effects decreased million in this decrease relates to decreases in miscellaneous gas income 
in  there was a million increase in other effects 
this increase reflects a million increase in the gcim and other miscellaneous increases totaling million 
natural gas purchased in  natural gas purchased increased million  or 
this increase is primarily due to higher average wellhead prices 
natural gas prices cost per therm increased in a pga clause allows mge to pass along to customers the cost of gas  subject to certain limited incentives 
the pga is authorized by the pscw 
a similar effect was felt in when natural gas purchased increased million  or 
natural gas prices cost per therm increased more than in gas operating expenses gas operating expense increased million  or  in  and increased million  or  in the following changes contributed to the net change in gas operating expense for the indicated year in millions increased production costs increased distribution costs increased customer services  promotions  account costs increased outside professional services decreased increased health and pension expenses increased other administrative and general expenses total gas operating expenses depreciation gas depreciation expense increased million and million in and  respectively  as a result of additional gas plant assets 
gas cost incentives under mge s gcim  if actual gas commodity costs are above or below a benchmark set by the pscw  then mge s gas sales service customers and shareholders share equally in any increased costs or savings 
the pscw allows mge to resell gas pipeline capacity reserved to meet peak demands but not needed every day to serve customers 
revenues from capacity release that exceed or fall short of pscw targeted levels are shared equally 
beginning february   the pscw lowered the formula used in establishing the benchmark for gas commodity costs 
the benchmark moved to of what it would have been under the prior formula 
this change was intended to better reflect market conditions 
in  mge shareholders benefited million from capacity release revenues and commodity savings under the gcim 
in  mge shareholders benefited million from capacity release revenues and commodity savings under the gcim 
other general taxes mge energy s other general taxes increased in primarily because mge s license fee tax increased 
the annual license fee tax expense is based on adjusted operating revenues of the prior year 
tax rates have not increased 
income taxes mge energy s effective income tax rate is for compared to in the lower effective income tax rate is primarily due to accounting for the medicare part d federal subsidy and the favorable resolution of a tax contingency  for which a liability had been established 
the effective income tax rate of was up slightly from the rate of due to constant amounts of tax credits amortized investment tax credits and credit for electricity from wind energy in relation to pretax income 
other nonregulated operating income mge construct received service fees of million and million from the state in and  respectively 
the service fees covered mge construct s role as epc contractor for wccf 
this amount is classified as revenue from nonregulated operations within mge energy s financial statements 
the total fee of million will be recognized as services are rendered and will be collected over a month period 
other operations and maintenance expense increased million in for mge power west campus 
this is primarily related to higher administrative and general expenses 
other nonoperating items other income increased million in due to a million gain on the sale of assets  an increase in atc earnings of million  a decrease in charitable contributions of million  and million in additional tax settlements 
in  other income decreased million because charitable contributions were higher 
interest expense in  interest expense decreased million  or  due to the following factors lower levels of long term debt outstanding during the third and fourth quarters 
lower levels of short term debt in the third quarter as a result of the proceeds raised in the equity offering 
in  interest expense decreased million  or  due to the following factors mge refinanced a large portion of its long term debt in lower short term interest rates coupled with reduced borrowing levels 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following summarizes cash flows for mge energy and mge during   and mge energy mge in thousands cash provided by used for operating activities       investing activities       financing activities       cash provided by operating activities mge energy mge energy s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities is derived mainly from the electric and gas operations of its principal subsidiary  mge 
cash provided by operating activities was million in working capital increased million 
this resulted from a million increase in current asset balances and an million rise in current liability balances 
current assets were up due to increases in trade and other receivables million  stored natural gas million  unbilled revenues million  and prepayments million 
current liabilities were up due to increases in accounts payable million 
this increase in accounts payable was offset by a million decrease in other current liabilities 
a change in other noncurrent items  net  of million  also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
during  the receivable from atc for funds advanced in connection with wccf transmission system upgrades became current 
this resulted in a million change in the special billing projects atc balance 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased million  or 
working capital increased million primarily due to increases in unbilled revenues million  stored natural gas million  prepayments million  and accounts receivable million and a decrease in accrued interest and taxes million 
these changes were offset by higher accounts payable of million and other current liabilities of million 
deferred income taxes increased million in  due to the impact of additional bonus depreciation  which went into effect in may an increase in other noncurrent items  net  of million also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
mge cash provided by operating activities was million for working capital increased million 
this resulted from a million increase in current asset balances and a million increase in the current liabilities balances 
current assets rose due to increases in trade and other receivables million  stored natural gas million  unbilled revenues million  and prepayments million 
current liabilities were higher due to increases in accounts payable million  offset by a million decrease in other current liabilities 
a change in other noncurrent items  net  of million also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities

working capital increased million in other current assets  such as unbilled revenues  inventories  and prepayments  increased a total of million 
in  there was a decrease in accounts receivable of million and increases in accounts payable of million 
other current liabilities increased million and accrued interest and taxes decreased million 
deferred income taxes increased million in other noncurrent items  net  increased million  which contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
capital requirements and investing activities mge energy in  mge energy s cash used for investing activities increased million 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures and additional capital contributions made to atc during capital expenditures related to wccf increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the prior year 
however  mge utility plant additions decreased million during compared to during mge also made million in additional capital contributions to atc 
these increases in investing activities were offset by decreases in the advance to atc related to wccf million  proceeds from the sale of property million  and other investing activities million 
in  mge energy s cash used for investing activities increased million 
capital expenditures increased million in utility plant additions decreased million  while capital expenditures related to the wccf increased million over last year 
mge s advance to atc in connection with the installation of equipment and system upgrades for wccf increased million in in  mge was still contributing to the decommissioning fund for kewaunee 
mge cash used for investing activities was million for  compared to million in the prior year 
as of december   mge power west campus is being consolidated into mge in accordance with fin r 
therefore  for all of  mge s cash used for investing activities includes the capital expenditures related to wccf 
mge also made capital contributions to atc totaling million 
these increases are offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to mge utility plant in the amount of million  a decrease in the advance made to atc related to wccf million  proceeds from the sale of property million  and a decrease in cash used for other investing activities million 
in  mge s cash used for investing activities decreased million from million in  to million in this decrease is related to a million decrease in capital expenditures and the decrease in the nuclear decommissioning fund million 
in  mge was still contributing to the decommissioning fund for kewaunee 
additionally  there was a million decrease in cash used for other investing activities 
these decreases are offset by a million increase in the advance made to atc related to wccf 
the following table shows mge energy s estimated capital expenditures for  actual for  and the three year average for to in thousands for the years ended december estimated actual three year average to electric production    distribution and general    nuclear fuel total electric    gas    common    utility plant total    nonregulated wccf and other    eliminations mge energy total    mge energy s and mge s liquidity are primarily affected by their construction requirements 
we allocate common plant for the financial statements and footnotes based on a prescribed formula electric and gas 
mge energy s major capital projects include wccf and the implementation of a new general ledger  purchasing  accounts payable  and inventory system 
during  million in capital additions were made for the construction of wccf 
this amount includes million of interest capitalized in accordance with the provisions set forth in sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost 
mge energy used funds received as dividend payments from mge as well as short and long term external financing to meet its capital requirements and cash obligations  including dividend payments 
external financing included short term financing under existing lines of credit 
additionally  mge utilized longer term equity financing 
on september   mge energy completed the issuance of  shares of its common stock through an equity offering 
mge also issued  shares of common stock pursuant to a distribution agreement with bocm and the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
while dividends from mge will remain a significant source for the cash needs of mge energy  we expect that revenues from the wccf will supplement those dividends starting in  when the plant becomes operational 
in the interim  mge energy expects to continue using existing lines of credit and to issue additional long term debt and shares of common stock  in addition to cash dividends from mge  to meet its capital requirements and other cash obligations  including dividends 
dividend payments by mge to mge energy are subject to restrictions arising under a january   pscw rate order and  to a lesser degree  mge s first mortgage bonds 
the covenants contained in mge s first mortgage bonds restrict the payment of dividends or any other distribution or purchase of shares to the existing earned surplus retained earnings on mge common stock 
the pscw order also limits the amount of dividends that mge may pay mge energy when its common equity ratio  calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding  is less than 
under those circumstances  mge may not pay dividends in excess of million plus dividends on shares issued in excess of the shares issued in the rate proceeding forecast if the proceeds are invested in mge 
mge s common equity ratio at december   is estimated to be as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding 
the rate proceeding calculation includes as indebtedness imputed amounts for mge s outstanding purchase power capacity payments and other pscw adjustments and excludes the indebtedness associated with mge power west campus  which is consolidated in accordance with fin r into mge s financial statements 
in addition  mge has covenanted with the holders of its first mortgage bonds not to declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or purchase any shares of its common stock unless  after giving effect thereto  the aggregate amount of all such dividends and distributions and all amounts applied to such purchases  after december   shall not exceed the earned surplus retained earnings accumulated subsequent to december  as of december   approximately million was available for the payment of dividends under this covenant 
mge used internally generated funds  short term debt  and proceeds from common stock issued to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
in  mge expects to use internally generated funds and short term debt 
for larger capital investments  mge would expect to finance these with additional short and long term debt and capital contributions from mge energy  if necessary 
financing activities and capitalization matters mge energy cash provided by mge energy s financing activities was million for  compared to million for this increase is related to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the reduction of long term net borrowings during proceeds from the issuance of common stock increased million for when compared to the prior year 
this increase is a result of the equity issuance completed september  proceeds received under this issuance were primarily utilized to repay short term obligations 
additional equity was issued under the distribution agreement through bocm and through the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
during  mge energy made million in repayments on pre existing long term facilities 
no additional long term debt was issued during however  there was a million increase in the short term debt balance 
cash dividends for increased million and cash received from other financing activities increased million compared to the prior year 
in  cash provided by mge energy s financing activities was million 
on september   mge energy s subsidiary  mge power west campus  issued million in private placement debt  increasing long term debt and using the proceeds from this issue to pay off short term debt 
mge energy was temporarily financing the capital expenditures for wccf with short term debt 
mge refinanced million of its  series  first mortgage bonds with lower cost debt 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock increased million in in addition to its dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  mge energy also sold additional shares of stock through bocm under a distribution agreement 
short term debt decreased million in mge energy  through its affiliate mge construct  received a reimbursement of million in november from the state for its share of the capital expenditures related to wccf 
this reimbursement was used to pay down mge energy s bank loan 
mge during  cash provided by mge s financing activities was million compared to cash used for financing activities of million in this change resulted from consolidating mge power west campus into mge in accordance with fin r 
mge s financing activities include an equity contribution made from mge energy to wccf for million and million of affiliate financing for wccf 
cash dividends to the parent decreased million  and equity contributions from the parent increased million 
during  short term borrowings increased million  million in long term debt was repaid  and no new long term debt was issued 
additionally  there was a million decrease in cash used by other financing activities 
in  mge s cash used for financing activities was million 
in conformity with fin r  mge includes the consolidation of mge power west campus see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
mge power west campus had million of affiliate loans for the financing of wccf 
mge benefited from million in equity contributions from its parent  which was offset by million in cash dividends paid to parent 
mge s short term debt increased million 
mge energy s capitalization ratios were as follows mge energy common shareholders equity long term debt short term debt includes the current portion of long term debt below is a table of mge s current credit ratings 
mge energy is not rated because it has not issued any debt securities 
standard poor s moody s first mortgage bonds aa aa unsecured debt aa aa commercial paper a p mge s access to the capital markets  including the commercial paper market  and its financing costs in those markets are dependent on its securities ratings 
none of mge s borrowing is subject to default or prepayment due to downgrading of securities ratings

the above amounts do not include any contributions that may be made for mge s pension and postretirement plans 
there are no required contributions for the plan year  however  mge may be legally required per irs standards to make contributions to the plans in years subsequent to due to uncertainties in the future economic performance of plan assets  discount rates  and other key assumptions  management is unable to estimate these amounts at this time 
mge made a million contribution in  related to the plan year 
this payment was made strictly at mge s discretion as there are no contributions required for or mge energy s and mge s commercial commitments as of december   representing commitments triggered by future events and including financing arrangements to secure obligations of mge energy and mge  and guarantees by mge  are as follows expiration within due after in thousands total year years years years mge energy bank letter of credit a available lines of credit b    guarantees c     mge bank letter of credit a available lines of credit d    guarantees e     a mge has a letter of credit with a commercial bank established as collateral for equipment purchases that atc will make to provide necessary system upgrades for wccf 
b amount includes those facilities discussed in d plus an additional line of credit 
namely  mge energy has available at any time a million line of credit  expiring at the end of september at december   mge energy s line of credit was million 
the line of credit increased on january   to million and will increase to million on april  c amounts include those guarantees described in e as well as guarantees held by mge energy 
namely  mge energy has guaranteed debt service payments on a development project 
d lines of credit consisting of a three year  million committed revolving credit facility expiring in july  and an additional million credit facility that matures on march  each credit facility is used to support commercial paper issuances 
at december   there were no borrowings under either credit facility 
additionally  at december   there was million of commercial paper outstanding 
e mge has guaranteed repayment of certain receivables it sold to a financial institution under a chattel paper agreement 
see footnotes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other factors due to the performance of the united states debt and equity markets  the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of pension and postretirement benefit plans may vary 
business and regulatory environment electric transmission atc on january   mge transferred substantially all of its electric transmission facilities to atc in exchange for approximately a interest in this joint venture 
atc is comprised of wisconsin investor owned utilities and some wisconsin municipal utilities  cooperatives  and power supply agencies 
the pscw authorized an electric rate surcharge of million  or  over a twelve month period ended october   for mge to recover deferred costs associated with atc s formation and ongoing incremental transmission costs during and on november   mge and atc entered into an interconnection agreement related to transmission system upgrades for wccf 
mge issued to atc a notice to proceed for the procurement of the equipment for the system upgrades 
mge has advanced funds for construction of transmission equipment and work done by atc related to wccf in the amounts of million and million in and  respectively 
total funds advanced to atc for this project are million 
mge does not expect to make any additional advances to atc in mge will be reimbursed by atc for all previously advanced funds upon completion of the project 
regulatory issues transmission in connection with its role as a ferc approved rto  the midwest iso is developing a bid based energy market  which is expected to be implemented on april  in connection with the development of this energy market  the midwest iso is developing a market based platform for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the lmp system that has been implemented in other states 
it is expected that the lmp system will include the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through the use of ftrs 
during december and january  the midwest iso completed the initial allocation of ftrs 
the ftrs will be available through an auction based system run by the midwest iso 
it is unknown at this time what financial impact the lmp congestion pricing system will have on mge 
kewaunee sale mge sold to wpsc its ownership interest in kewaunee in september on the closing date  mge also transferred its qualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value and nonqualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value  which decreased accumulated depreciation by an equal amount 
under the kewaunee sale agreement  mge was obligated to continue collecting decommissioning costs from its customers during  and to remit those amounts  net of trust investment expenses and taxes on investment income  to the wpsc nonqualified decommissioning fund  which it did on january  the federal government is responsible for the disposition and storage of spent nuclear fuel 
federal legislation is being considered to establish an interim storage facility 
spent nuclear fuel is currently stored at kewaunee 
minor plant modifications to the spent fuel pools in should ensure kewaunee has sufficient fuel storage capacity until the end of its licensed life in mge retained spent fuel obligations for all fuel burned at kewaunee for its share of the generation from the opening of the plant to the transaction closing date 
wpsc took title to such fuel at the closing date 
a surcharge imposed by the national energy policy act of requires nuclear power companies to fund the decontamination and decommissioning of us department of energy facilities that process nuclear fuel 
as a result  the kewaunee co owners are required to pay a surcharge on uranium enrichment services purchased from the federal government prior to october  on an inflation adjusted basis  mge s portion of the obligation related to kewaunee is approximately million at december  mge is required to continue paying its portion of this annual assessment 
as allowed under the kewaunee sale agreement  mge exercised an option to purchase mw of electric capacity and energy at a fixed price from september   through september   to help meet customers electric needs 
wind power purchase agreement on july   mge signed a year power purchase agreement for mw of wind energy to be located near waupun  wisconsin 
the agreement would increase mge s wind power output capacity from mw to mw 
this project is pending approval from the pscw which is expected to be granted in nonregulated energy outlook wccf mge energy  through mge power  mge power west campus  and mge construct  is building a natural gas fired cogeneration facility on the uw campus 
as planned  the facility will have capacity to produce  tons of chilled water   pounds per hour of steam  and approximately mw of electricity 
the uw and mge power west campus will jointly own the facility 
the uw will own a controlling interest in the chilled water and steam plants in accordance with the epc agreement 
this interest will be used to help meet the uw s growing need for air conditioning and steam heat capacity 
mge power west campus will own a controlling interest in the electric generation plant  which will be used to provide electricity to mge s customers 
mge entered into a lease with mge power west campus to lease the assets owned by mge power west campus  and mge will operate the entire facility 
mge construct is responsible for the construction of the facility 
a pscw order approving the issuance of a cpcn for the wccf was received on october  construction on the project commenced in october  and the project is expected to be completed by nd quarter for the year ended december   mge construct received a total service fee of million pretax from the state in relation to its role as epc contractor for wccf 
this amount is classified as revenue from nonregulated operations within mge energy s financial statements 
the total fee of million will be recognized as services are rendered and will be collected over a month period 
in accordance with the wccf lease between mge power west campus and mge  mge power west campus began billing mge for carrying costs on wccf 
the carrying costs billed to mge started on january   the date mge received approval from the pscw to defer these costs  and will continue through construction of the project 
carrying costs totaled million for the year ended december  mge energy  mge power west campus  and mge construct have assumed certain risks related to some of the executed agreements 
in the epc agreement  mge power west campus is responsible for cost overruns and mge construct is responsible for the construction process of the entire facility  paying liquidated damages relating to failure to achieve the mechanical completion date guarantee and or the acceptance test capacity guarantee 
mge energy is the guarantor of mge construct s obligations under the epc agreement 
the cost to construct wccf is expected to be approximately million in total  of which mge power west campus portion will be million 
as of december   mge power west campus had incurred million of costs on the project  which is reflected in construction work in progress on mge energy s and mge s consolidated balance sheets 
these costs represent amounts paid for equipment as well as other costs associated with construction of the facility 
power the future generation on february   mge secured an option to own a portion of the advanced technology  coal fired baseload generation facilities proposed in we energies power the future plan 
pursuant to an amended agreement reached on january   mge has the option to acquire an undivided under certain conditions ownership interest in each of the proposed coal plants or up to approximately mw per unit 
the pscw issued an order in november  approving we energies request for cpcn for two units totaling approximately  megawatts 
the pscw also issued an order on june   approving mge s participation in each unit should mge choose to exercise its options and approving a facility lease agreement between mge power elm road a nonregulated subsidiary of mge energy and mge 
the financial terms of the facility lease include a capital structure of equity and long term debt  and return on equity of  a lease term of years  and a rent reduction in the first five years 
if the options on units and are exercised  mge energy s share of capital costs for an ownership interest in both units would be an estimated million 
on november   the dane county circuit court ruled on several lawsuits which challenged the pscw s order authorizing we energies to build two coal fired generating facilities on the site of their existing oak creek power plant 
the dane county circuit court vacated the order and remanded the order back to the pscw for additional proceedings 
the court determined that the pscw committed errors in determining the completeness of and approving the application filed by wisconsin energy corporation on several different points 
on january   the supreme court of wisconsin granted we energies december  request for a direct  expedited lower court decision and agreed to consider all issues raised 
the court set a briefing schedule for february and march and set march   as the date for oral argument 
a final decision is expected in the second quarter of the resolution of this proceeding may adversely affect the construction of the units 
at present  unit is scheduled to begin operating in  and unit is scheduled to begin operating in mge anticipates making a decision on whether to exercise the options by the second quarter of  pending the final ruling by the court 
critical accounting policies mge energy and mge the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenues  pension obligations  income taxes  derivatives  and regulatory assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
unbilled revenues revenues from the sale of electricity and gas to customers are recorded when electricity gas is delivered to those customers 
the quantity of those sales is measured by customers meters 
due to the large volume of those meters  it is impractical to read all of them at month end 
meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter reading schedules 
consequently  at the end of any month  there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings 
as a result  management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between their meter read dates and the end of the period 
these estimates include the amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers line loss and the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers 
the mix of sales between customer rate classes  which is based upon historical utilization assumptions 
during  many of mge s largest customers were shifted to a calendar month bill 
as a result of this shift  the majority of these customers electricity usage is now accounted for in the unbilled calculation 
the unbilled amounts are based on actual usage billed the following month 
due to this billing shift  mge has seen the ratio of unbilled receivables to total electric sales climb 
the ratio has settled into a range of to  and mge will continue to monitor and track this range 
pension plans mge provides employees with certain retirement pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits  management must make a variety of estimates  including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs  the rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  health care trends  mortality rates  and other factors 
these accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure 
different estimates used by management could result in recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
we use third party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measure the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets 
they are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management s judgment and can materially affect net income 
assumed return on assets 
this assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
for  mge used a assumed return on assets 
one of the approaches mge used in determining its assumed return on assets is based on historical returns 
as of december   the ten year historical return was 
it is reasonably possible that we could have used a different estimate for the rate of return on plan assets in calculating pension expense 
holding other assumptions constant  for every reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  annual pension expense would increase by approximately million  before taxes 
discount rate 
the discount rate represents the rate at which pension obligations could effectively be settled on a present value basis 
mge uses high grade bond yields plus a premium as a benchmark 
the premium is based on the relatively long duration of mge s pension plan liabilities and the fact that certain benefit payments are in the form of an annuity 
moody s aa corporate bond yield was on december  as such  this approach generated a discount rate ie  
medical trend assumptions 
the health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per capita health care charges 
for  the health trend was reset to with the ultimate trend of reached in the health trend assumption for was reset from to as a result of an expanded relationship with a managed care health provider with a greater emphasis on preventive care  provider discounts and better utilization management 
income tax provision mge energy s and mge s income tax provisions  including both current and deferred components  are based on estimates  assumptions  calculations  and interpretation of tax statutes for the current and future years 
determination of current year federal and state income tax will not be settled for years 
management regularly makes assessments of tax return outcomes relative to financial statement tax provisions and adjusts the tax provisions in the period when facts become final 
additionally  in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
accounting for derivative instruments mge accounts for derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 amendment of sfas no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 all derivatives except those qualifying for the normal purchase normal sale exception are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
fair value is determined using current quoted market prices 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of a derivative not designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in current period earnings 
a cash flow hedge is a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
in the third quarter of  mge received approval from the pscw to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the deferral of the effects of mark to market accounting as required by sfas no 
on contracts related to mge s regulated operations 
regulatory assets liabilities regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates 
mge bases its assessment of recovery by precedents established by the regulatory body 
regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers to fund future expected costs or amounts received in rates that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods 
these costs typically include deferral of energy costs  the normalization of income taxes  and the deferral of losses incurred on debt retirements 
the accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
mge continually assesses whether the regulatory assets meet the criteria for probability of future recovery 
this assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
if future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable  the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current period revenues or expenses 
amortization of regulatory assets is provided over the recovery period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement 
adoption of accounting principles and recently issued accounting pronouncements mge energy and mge sfas no 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
which requires entities to recognize the estimated fair value of legal liabilities for asset retirements in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
applies to such things as the removal of an electric substation  a combustion turbine generating unit  wind generating facilities  and the photovoltaic generating facilities  all of which are located on property not owned by mge and would be removed upon the ultimate end of the lease 
at december   this liability is estimated at million and is included in other deferred liabilities 
at the point the liability for asset retirement is incurred  sfas no 
requires capitalization of the costs to the related asset  property  plant  and equipment  net 
for asset retirement obligations existing at the time of adoption  the statement requires capitalization of costs at the level that existed at the point of incurring the liability 
these capitalized costs are depreciated over the same period as the related property 
at the date of adoption  the depreciation expense for past periods was recorded as a regulatory asset in accordance with sfas no 
because mge believes the pscw will allow it to recover these costs in future rates 
current depreciation of the asset retirement cost is also being deferred as a regulatory asset under sfas no 
the initial liability is accreted to its present value each period 
mge defers this accretion as a regulatory asset based on its determination that these costs can be collected from customers 
mge also may have asset retirement obligations relating to various assets  such as combustion turbine generating units  small distributed generating units  above ground and underground storage tanks  facilities located at columbia co owned with alliant and wpsc  and certain electric and gas distribution facilities 
these facilities are generally located on property owned by third parties  on which mge is permitted to operate by lease  permit  easement  license  or service agreement  but also include some facilities located on property owned by mge 
the asset retirement obligations associated with these facilities cannot be reasonably determined due to the indeterminate life of the related assets 
the pro forma asset retirement obligation mge would have recognized as of january   had mge implemented sfas no 
as of that date  was approximately million based on the information  assumptions  and interest rates as of january   used to determine the million liability recognized upon initial adoption of sfas no 
because mge s regulators are allowing these costs to be recovered in future rates  adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of would have had no impact on net income and earnings per share of common stock 
accordingly  pro forma impacts are not presented 
fin in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation provides the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation 
in connection with its shared savings program  mge is party to a chattel paper purchase agreement with a financial institution under which it can sell or finance an undivided interest with recourse  in up to million of the financing program receivables  until august  the liability for the fair value of the obligation associated with these loans is not material 
mge would be required to perform under the guarantee if the customer defaulted on its loan 
the energy related equipment installed at the customer sites is used to secure the customer loans 
the length of the mge guarantee to the financial institution varies from one to ten years depending on the term of the customer loan 
principal payments for the next five years on the loans are million in and  million in  million in  and million in fin r in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
in december  the fasb issued the updated and final interpretation fin r 
fin r requires that an equity investor in a vie have significant equity at risk generally a minimum of  which is an increase from required under the previous guidance and hold a controlling interest  evidenced by voting rights  and absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected returns  or both 
if the equity investor is unable to evidence these characteristics  the entity that retains these ownership characteristics will be required to consolidate the vie as the primary beneficiary 
fin was applicable immediately to vies created or obtained after january  fin r was effective on december   for interests in entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under then existing authoritative guidance 
mge power west campus is a vie pursuant to fin r  as the equity investment at december   was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional support 
mge concluded a vie relationship exists due to the long term lease arrangement between mge and mge power west campus 
mge power west campus will lease a major portion of its assets  a power plant  to mge  pursuant to this leasing arrangement  and mge will absorb a majority of the expected losses  residual returns  or both 
the vie was consolidated into mge as of december  fin r also requires mge to assess whether the participants within its shared savings program constitute vies in which mge might be considered to be the consolidating entity 
mge has reviewed of the total shared savings program balance and has determined that the provisions of fin r are not applicable via the business scope exception 
for the remaining of the total shared savings program balance  mge has not performed this assessment 
these entities are not legally obligated to provide the financial information to mge that is necessary to determine whether mge must consolidate these entities 
mge will continue to attempt to obtain information from these customers in order to determine whether they should be consolidated by mge 
fsp on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of was signed into law  authorizing medicare to provide prescription drug benefits to retirees 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  was issued on may  the fsp provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the new medicare prescription drug legislation by employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under medicare part d 
during the third quarter of  mge adopted the provisions of fsp  resulting in a remeasurement of its postretirement plans assets and apbo as of january  the effect of the subsidy on benefits attributable to past service was accounted for as an actuarial experience gain  resulting in a decrease in the apbo of million 
the annualized reduction in the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is estimated to be million compared to the annual cost calculated without considering the effects of the prescription drug act 
previously reported financial information for the three months ended march  and june  have also been adjusted to reflect a reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit cost as if fsp was adopted as of january  amounts for these periods  when presented in future periods for comparative purposes  will be presented as such 
fsp in december  the fasb issued fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 application for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas 
the american jobs creation act of act  signed into law on october   provided  generally  for a tax deduction  effective for taxable years beginning after december   for domestic manufacturing activities of up to nine percent when fully phased in of the lesser of qualified production activities income  as defined in the act  or taxable income 
fsp clarified that the tax deduction for domestic manufacturing activities under the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

this act and these standards do not appear to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
eitf in march  the eitf reached consensus on and the fasb ratified eitf issues no 
 the meaning other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
mge and mge energy adopted the disclosure requirements of eitf for investments accounted for under sfas no 
for the year ended december  on september   the fasb issued eitf  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which delayed the effective date of the application guidance on impairment of securities included within eitf the eitf and the fasb are reconsidering the conclusions reached within eitf inflation the current financial statements report operating results in terms of historical cost  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
because utilities can depreciate only the historical cost of utility plant  there may not be adequate cash flows from existing plant to replace this investment 
under pscw rate treatment  projected operating costs  including the impacts of inflation  are recovered in revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mge energy and mge 
mge energy and mge are potentially exposed to market risk associated with interest rates  commodity prices  weather  and equity returns 
mge currently has no exposure to foreign currency risk 
mge manages some risk exposure through risk management policies and uses derivative instruments 
mge s market risk has not changed between and mge does not enter into speculative trading transactions 
weather risk mge s sales forecasts  used to establish rates  are set by the pscw based upon estimated temperatures  which approximate year averages 
mge s electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season and  to some extent  to the winter heating season 
a significant portion of mge s gas system demand is driven by heating 
mge s gas margin revenues less gas purchased is collected under a combination of fixed and volumetric rates set by the pscw based on normal weather 
as a result of weather sensitive demand and volumetric rates  a portion of mge s gas margin is at risk for warmer than normal weather 
mge may use weather derivatives  pursuant to its risk management program  to reduce the impact of weather volatility on its gas margin 
in october  mge entered into a nonexchange traded hdd collar 
per the terms and conditions of this derivative agreement  mge is subject to a floor and a ceiling based on forecasted heating degree days 
if actual heating degree days exceed the ceiling  mge is obligated to pay  and if heating degree days are below the floor  mge will receive payment 
the payment or receipt under this agreement is not permitted to exceed million excluding premium 
the term of this agreement extends from november   until march   and the premium for this weather hedge is million 
the company is accounting for the hdd collar using the intrinsic value method pursuant to the requirements of eitf no 
 accounting for weather derivatives 
through december   actual hdd were  resulting in a million gain for mge 
a summary of actual weather information in the utility segment s service territory during   and  as measured by degree days  may be found in results of operations 
interest rate risk both mge and mge energy have short term borrowings at varying interest rates 
mge issues commercial paper for its short term borrowings  while mge energy draws from its current credit facility to meet its short term borrowing needs see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowing levels vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors 
future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
mge energy and mge manage interest rate risk by limiting its variable rate exposure and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
mge is not exposed to changes in interest rates on a substantial portion of its long term debt until that debt matures and is refinanced at market rates 
assuming the current level of variable rate borrowings and assuming a change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million for mge and million for mge energy 
equity price risk pension related assets mge currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits through trust funds 
these funds  which include investments in debt and equity securities  are managed by various investment managers 
changes in market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
holding other assumptions constant  for every reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  annual pension expense would increase by approximately million  before taxes 
mge s risk of expense and annuity payments  as a result of changes in the market value of the trust funds  is mitigated in part through future rate actions by the pscw 
commodity price risk mge has commodity price risk exposure with respect to the price of natural gas  electricity  coal  and oil 
mge employs established policies and procedures to reduce the market risks associated with changing commodity prices  including the use of commodity and financial instruments see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
mge s commodity risks are somewhat mitigated by the current ratemaking process in place for recovering electric fuel  purchased energy  and the cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
mge s electric fuel costs are subject to fuel rules established by the pscw  which further mitigate commodity risk 
under the fuel rules  if electric fuel costs exceed or fall below a bandwidth set by the pscw  mge can apply for a fuel surcharge or may have a fuel credit to its customers 
under the pga authorized by the pscw  mge passes through to customers the cost of gas  subject to certain limited incentives 
under the fuel rules  mge may include the costs and benefits of fuel price risk management tools implemented under a risk management plan approved by the pscw 
in  the pscw extended its conditional approval of mge s electric procurement risk management program through december  mge has a limited number of financial gas commodity contracts 
these contracts are primarily comprised of exchange traded option contracts to manage the cost of gas and over the counter financial floating to fixed price swaps and calls for the winter set price firm gas sales service pilot program 
the derivative amounts recorded as a result of these gas contracts are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability because these transactions are part of the pga and not subject to incentive participation 
regulatory recovery risk mge s electric operations burn natural gas in several of its peak power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants and in many cases  the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas 
mge bears significant regulatory risk for the recovery of such fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its current rate structure 
as noted above in commodity price risk  the electric operations of mge operate under a fuel rules adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity 
this clause establishes a base rate for fuel and purchased power 
mge assumes the risks and benefits of variances that are within a bandwidth 
for and  fuel and purchased power costs included in mge s base fuel rates were million and million  respectively 
in and  the base fuel rates included a fuel credit in the amount of million and million  respectively 
of the million recorded in  million related to the proceedings and million related to the proceedings 
credit risk counterparty credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparty nonperformance 
mge is exposed to credit risk primarily through its merchant energy business 
mge uses credit policies to manage its credit risk  which includes utilizing an established credit approval process  monitoring counterparty limits  employing credit mitigation measures such as collateral or prepayment arrangements  and using netting agreements 
due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity mge originally contracted for  mge could sustain a loss that could have a material impact on its financial results 
additionally  if a counterparty were to default and mge were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  mge s credit loss would include the loss in value of mark to market contracts  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
mge is obligated to provide service to all electric and gas customers within its respective franchised territories 
as a result  mge has a broad customer base 
for the year ended december   mge s ten largest electric customers represented approximately of its retail electric revenues 
mge s ten largest gas customers represented approximately of its gas revenues 
credit risk for electric and gas is managed by mge s credit and collection policies  which are consistent with state regulatory requirements
