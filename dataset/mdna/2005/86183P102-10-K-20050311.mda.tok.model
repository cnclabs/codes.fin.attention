critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates estimates and assumptions used in its financial statements 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
the company often enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is the company s obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
warranty reserves the company s warranty reserve is established based on the company s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with the company s current understanding of the status of existing claims 
estimating the warranty reserve requires the company to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
while the company believes that its warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
the company s customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively affect the company s exposure to these costs 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet 
table of contents its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected

if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
the company does not have collateral requirements with its customers 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for us inventories and by the first in  first out fifo or average cost method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company discontinued its amortization of goodwill on january  in lieu of amortization  this standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment as of the date of adoption  at least annually thereafter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  the company is exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
at december   however  all of the company s debt was fixed rate debt 

table of contents commodity price risk the company s risk related to commodity prices has historically not been material  however  given the current economic climate and the recent increases in certain commodity costs  the company currently is experiencing an increased risk particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  steel and resins 
the company is managing this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with its suppliers 
the company may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
at this time  the company does not intend to use financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
the recent increases in certain commodity costs have negatively impacted the company s operating results  and a continuation of such price increases could significantly impact its profitability 
foreign currency exchange risk the company s risks related to foreign currency exchange rates have historically not been material  however  given the current economic climate  the company is monitoring this risk 
the company does not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which it operates 
therefore  a change in the value of the us dollar would not significantly affect the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
there have been no material changes to the company s exposures to market risk  except for commodity price risk  since december   as reported in the annual report on form k
