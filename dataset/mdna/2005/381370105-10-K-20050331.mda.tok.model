item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the company  through its subsidiary southeast power corporation  is engaged in the construction and maintenance of electrical facilities for utilities and industrial customers 
the company also installs fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
the company is also involved in the development of residential condominium projects 
to date  the company has purchased five sites on the east coast of central florida  on all of which the company has developed or plans to develop condominium complexes 
the company has developed three of the sites which were subsequently sold  one site is currently under construction and the remaining site is completing the permitting stage of development overview the company had higher electrical construction revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to the restoration work performed as a result of the damage caused by the four major hurricanes which struck florida during the third quarter of however  electrical construction operating margins were negatively affected by unforeseen operational difficulties primarily attributable to a single electrical construction contract now completed encountered in the second quarter of and unanticipated costs related to adverse weather conditions experienced on several jobs primarily in georgia and south carolina during the fourth quarter of  which were partially offset by stronger results in the first and third quarters of the year 
revenues and operating income from the real estate development operations decreased during the past year due to the completion of our third condominium project in the second quarter of and having no other projects under construction during the second half of the year 
the company believes the market remains strong for its condominium development projects and the results from our real estate operations should improve in with the commencement of construction of oak park  the company s forty unit townhouse style condominium located in cape canaveral  florida  in january and the anticipated commencement of construction for the initial phase of the thirty three unit pineapple house project in late  each of which is larger than any of the company s prior condominium projects 
since the pineapple house project is still in the permitting phase  there can be no assurance as to specific timing with respect to the commencement of construction 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to fixed price electrical construction contracts  real estate development projects  deferred income tax assets and environmental remediation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management has discussed the selection and development of its critical accounting policies  estimates and related disclosure with the audit committee of the board of directors 
percentage of completion electrical construction segment a number of factors relating to our electrical construction segment affect the recognition of contract revenue 
the company recognizes revenue when electrical services are performed except when work is performed under a fixed price contract 
revenue from fixed price electrical construction contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  changes in productivity and scheduling  and the cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  client needs  client delays in providing approvals  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  a change in the availability and proximity of materials and governmental regulation  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of income and revenue recognition 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
due to our experience and the detailed approach in determining our cost estimates for all of our significant projects we believe our estimates to be highly reliable 
however  our projects can be complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a number of projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
if a current estimate of total costs indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
revenue from change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is probable 
percentage of completion real estate development segment our initial condominium project was accounted for under the deposit method due to our limited experience in condominium development business 
accordingly  the recognition of related revenue and expenses was deferred until the project was complete and the underlying titles were transferred to the buyers 
as of august  commencing with the second condominium development project  revenue associated with real estate development projects that meet the criteria specified by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  have been recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue is recognized when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  buyers are unable to receive refunds of down payments except in the event of non delivery  a substantial percentage of the condominiums are under firm contracts  collection of the sales price is reasonably assured and sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognized is calculated based on the percentage of completion  as determined by the construction contract costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated construction costs 
a significant majority of the total estimated project costs is attributable to the fixed price construction contract  the residual estimated costs could vary from actual and the variation is recognized in the period it is determined 
the company believes that a material difference in total actual project costs versus total estimated project costs is unlikely due to the nature of a fixed price construction contract 
as of december   all real estate condominium projects being accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting were complete 
if a current estimate of total project costs indicates a loss on a project  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
the timing of revenue and expense recognition is contingent on construction productivity 
factors possibly impeding construction productivity include  but are not limited to  supply of labor  materials and equipment  scheduling  weather  permitting and unforeseen events 
if a buyer were to default on the contract for sale  revenues and expenses recognized in prior periods would be adjusted in the period of default 
deferred tax assets the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered or settled 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company were to subsequently determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the previously recorded valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   the deferred tax asset was largely comprised of net operating loss nol carryforwards which will expire from through refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based on historical experience and other various assumptions including forecasts of future taxable income and tax planning  the company anticipates being able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the nol carryforwards prior to their respective expiration dates and therefore  did not record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
provision for remediation in september  the company was notified by the united states environmental protection agency the epa that it is a potentially responsible party a prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at a mine that it had formerly owned 
refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on this matter 
in september  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies  and statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  the company recognized a provision of  within discontinued operations for this matter  in addition  this provision was increased by  during the twelve month period ended december  this increased the total provision to  total actual remediation costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from this estimate  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental costs 
results of operations segment information the table below shows the company s consolidated revenue and operating income attributable to its segments for each of the years in the three year period ended december  revenue electrical construction real estate development total operating income electrical construction real estate development total operating income is total operating revenue less operating expenses inclusive of depreciation and selling  general and administrative expenses for each segment 
operating income excludes interest expense  interest income and income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations revenues total revenues in the year ended december  decreased by to  compared to  in the year ended december  this decrease in total revenues was mainly due to a difference in the timing of real estate construction activities in and electrical construction revenue increased by in the year ended december  to  from  in the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to restoration work done during the third quarter of as a result of the four major hurricanes that hit the southeast 
the varying magnitude and duration of electrical construction projects may result in substantial fluctuation in the company s backlog from time to time 
at february   the approximate value of uncompleted contracts was  compared to  at february  we expect to complete approximately of this backlog during fiscal year revenues recognized by the real estate development operations for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily the result of timing differences in real estate construction projects between and as of february   the real estate operation s backlog outstanding real estate contracts for sale excluding partial revenue already recognized on said contracts under the percentage of completion method was approximately  compared to approximately  as of february  we expect to complete and deliver of our backlog at february  to our buyers during fiscal year there can be no assurance that settlements of condominiums subject to contracts for sale will occur 
operating results electrical construction operations had an operating income of  in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of  during the year ended december   a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  operating margins on electrical construction operations decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the operating margin was primarily a result of the increased labor hours and equipment costs required to meet project completion dates due to operational difficulties from one project now completed during the second quarter and adverse weather conditions experienced on several jobs primarily in georgia and south carolina during the fourth quarter of the year  both of which were partially offset by stronger results in the first and third quarters of the year 
we cannot project the levels of future demand for construction services 
real estate development operations had an operating income of  in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of  in the year ended december   a decrease of 
this decrease was principally the result of final sales of condominium units during the second quarter of  which represented the only project under construction for the year 
operating margins  as a percentage of revenue  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the margins realized on the condominium units 
operating margins from real estate development operations are expected to vary due to the type and number of projects under construction at any given time and each project s estimated operating margin 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses  and the components thereof  increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
electrical construction costs increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in costs was primarily attributable to increased project costs due to the lack of available skilled labor  the availability of specialized equipment and adverse weather conditions 
the increased rain experienced in caused delays in the progression of projects which necessitated additional premium labor hours to meet project completion dates 
costs of the real estate development operations decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in costs was the result of the rescheduled start dates on two new projects  the first of which began construction in january and the second is due to begin in late depreciation and amortization was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization for was largely a result of an increase in capital expenditures in recent years  most of which were attributed to upgrading and replacing electrical construction equipment 
the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for each segment for the years ended december  as indicated electrical construction real estate development corporate total sg a expenses of the company decreased by to  in the year ended december   from  in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower bonuses and selling costs which were partially offset by an increase in wages and professional fees associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sg a expenses  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in the like period for income taxes the income taxes provision benefit was  in the year ended december   an effective tax rate of  as compared to  in the year ended december   an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate for the year ended december   largely due to expenses which are non deductible for tax purposes 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate  due to expenses which are non deductible for tax purposes and the effect of state income taxes

cloud mining company st 
cloud and the goldfield consolidated mines company consolidated mines  to an unrelated party 
the company received total cash consideration  net of a post closing adjustment  in the amount of an after tax loss on the sale of the mining operations was recorded in the fourth quarter of in the amount of  net assets disposed of approximated  and the related selling costs which included commission  severance and legal expenses were approximately  following the sale  in september  the company was notified by the epa that it is a prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at a mine formerly owned by consolidated mines 
please see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on this matter and the related provision recognized in the year ended december  summary operating results of discontinued operations for the year ended december  and are as follows provision for remediation loss from discontinued operations before income taxes and loss on sale income taxes benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of tax year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations revenues total revenues in the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  in the year ended december  this increase in total revenues was primarily the result of a significant increase in revenues generated by the electrical construction operations 
electrical construction revenue increased by in the year ended december  to  from  in the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both transmission line construction and fiber optic projects as a result of greater availability of electrical construction contracts 
the varying magnitude and duration of electrical construction projects may result in substantial fluctuation in the company s backlog from time to time 
at february   the approximate value of uncompleted contracts was  compared to  at february  revenues recognized by the real estate development operations for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was primarily the result of the units under construction having a higher average contract sales price per unit relative to the like period in as of february   real estate development operation s backlog outstanding real estate contracts for sale excluding partial revenue already recognized on said contracts under the percentage of completion method was approximately  compared to approximately  as of february  there can be no assurance that settlements of condominiums subject to contracts for sale will occur 
operating results electrical construction operations had an operating income of  in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of  during the year ended december   an increase of 
in  the company s electrical construction operating results were adversely affected by a lower level of activity attributable to a general slackening of industry demand 
as a percentage of revenue  operating margins on electrical construction operations decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the operating margin was primarily a result of higher than budgeted costs incurred due to adverse weather conditions encountered on several large electrical construction projects located in alabama and georgia 
the net increase of costs incurred was mainly comprised of increases  as a percentage of revenue  in subcontractor  material and equipment rental expenses  partially offset by decreases  as a percent of revenue  in salaries  depreciation and equipment repairs and maintenance for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december real estate development operations had an operating income of  in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of  in the year ended december   a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  operating margins decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a change in the mix of the units sold and in backlog from mainly high margin units to a combination of both lower margin and higher margin units 
operating margins from real estate development operations are expected to vary due to the type and number of projects under construction at any given time and each project s estimated operating margin

electrical construction costs increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in costs was primarily attributable to increases in the volume of work performed  insurance premiums due to rate increases  subcontractor costs incurred as a result of required construction services outside the scope of services generally provided by the company and project costs due to adverse weather conditions 
costs of the real estate development operations increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase of was the result of a change in the mix of the units sold and in backlog as discussed above in operating results 
depreciation and amortization was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization for was largely a result of an increase in capital expenditures in recent years  most of which were attributed to upgrading and replacing electrical construction equipment 
the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for each segment for the years ended december  as indicated electrical construction real estate development corporate total sg a expenses of the company decreased by to  in the year ended december   from  in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to higher legal and professional fees incurred in as a result of services required to sell the company s mining subsidiaries

cash flow analysis net cash flows for each of the three years ended december were as follows operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows from operating activities are comprised of income from continuing operations adjusted to reflect the timing of cash receipts and disbursements therefrom 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to net cash used by operating activities of  in changes in the accounts receivable and accrued billings provided  of cash during  compared to cash used of  in cash provided by accounts receivable and accrued billings was significantly higher in compared to the prior year  primarily due to a substantial decrease in the outstanding accounts receivable and accrued billings of the electrical construction segment 
changes in the contracts receivable of the real estate development operations provided  of cash in  when compared to  of cash used in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by contracts receivable in  when compared to  was due to the satisfaction of all contracts receivable derived from the most recent condominium project 
during  changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash in the amount of  when compared to cash provided in the prior year of  the cash used by accounts payable and accrued liabilities in was primarily related to a decrease in the electrical construction segment s accrued liabilities due to a lower level of electrical construction activity in the later part of investing activities net cash used by investing activities in was  compared to  in this significant increase in cash usage by the company s investing activities during when compared to was primarily the result of an increase of capital expenditures in to  from  in and the absence of the sale of any investment securities in compared to the majority of capital expenditures in and were attributable to purchases of machinery and equipment by the company s electrical construction segment which were prompted by an increase in the volume of work performed and an effort to increase equipment availability and reduce future equipment rental expense 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
financial instruments consist principally of cash  cash equivalents and short term  highly liquid us government debt securities with limited market risk sensitivity 
capital expenditures in are expected to approximate million  which the company anticipates funding through existing cash reserves 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was  compared to  in this increase in cash provided by financing activities in  relative to  was primarily due to the company s increased borrowings on the company s electrical construction subsidiary s equipment loan and a decrease in the amount of treasury stock repurchased in the company has paid no cash dividends on its common stock since  and it is not expected that the company will pay any cash dividends on its common stock in the immediate future 
forecast the company anticipates its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and credit facilities will provide sufficient cash to enable the company to meet its working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows as well as its ability to seek additional financing may be negatively impacted by factors including  but not limited to  a decline in demand for electrical construction services and or condominiums in the markets served and general economic conditions  heightened competition  availability of construction materials  increased interest rates and adverse weather conditions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s future aggregate contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations long term debt principal long term debt interest total purchase obligations include only agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
these amounts represent the employment contract of the ceo and leasehold improvement obligations 
includes  per year of interest on loans against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies included in other long term assets 
inflation as a result of relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results
