executive overview herman miller uses problem solving design and innovation to create great places to work  heal  live  and learn for our customers 
we do this by providing high quality furniture products and related knowledge services 
at present  most of our customers come to us for work environments 
our products include furniture systems  seating  storage and material handling solutions  freestanding furniture  and casegoods 
our services extend from workplace and real estate strategy to furniture asset management 
our primary domestic manufacturing operations are located in michigan and georgia 
we also have a significant manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  which represents our largest marketplace outside the united states 
in addition to sales in the united kingdom  our products are sold internationally through wholly owned subsidiaries or branches in canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  and the netherlands 
our products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships and licensees 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller production system hmps 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand under hmps 
accordingly  production is order driven with raw materials purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
as a result  the rate of our inventory turns is high 
these combined factors could cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low in relation to sales volume 
a key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while at the same time retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
core strengths we rely on the following core strengths in delivering workplace solutions to our customers 
building and leading networks we value relationships in all areas of our business 
we consider our networks of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among the most important competitive factors vital to the long term success of our business 
problem solving design and innovation we are committed to developing aesthetically and functionally innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research and design staff as well as external design resources that are generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence we were among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
we are committed to continuously improving both product quality and production efficiency 
core values we believe that in honoring our core values  we maximize our ability to deliver value to our customers  employees  shareholders  and communities 
the following is a list of these values  or what we call things that matter 
curiosity and exploration we believe the path to improvement  to finding new ideas and concepts  requires a willingness to take risks 
we accept the fact that failure is often a consequence of taking chances 
we also believe the lessons learned from failures can open the doors to new discovery 
design we believe good design solves problems 
we aspire to utilize good design not just in the products we offer our customers  but in all aspects of our business 
performance we believe performance is required for leadership 
we want to be leaders at herman miller  and so we are committed to performing at the highest level possible in everything we do 
relationships we believe the ability to amplify our talents through networks of people and organizations around the world depends on the quality of our relationships 
transparency we believe in letting people see how decisions are made and owning the decisions we make 
in doing so  we hope to foster relationships based on trust and integrity 
engagement we believe that the best results are found when people are actively engaged in their work 
we value individuals who own problems  solutions  and behaviors 
inclusiveness we believe to succeed as a company  we must include and embrace all the expressions of human talent and potential available to us 
foundations we believe our rich legacy can help guide us into the future 
we value and respect our past more for what it shows us we might become than as a picture of what we ve been 
a better world we believe in contributing to a better world by pursuing sustainability and environmental wisdom as well as supporting the communities in which we do business 
channels of distribution our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms of between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in several countries around the world 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at may  we owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary ie sales to the ie federal government 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
we believe independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is  on balance  the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this mind  our strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition our owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  our goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
challenges ahead like all businesses  we are faced with a host of challenges and risks 
we believe our core strengths and values  which provide the foundation for our strategic direction  have us well prepared to respond to the inevitable challenges we will face in the future 
while we are confident in our direction  we believe it prudent to acknowledge and remain mindful of the risks specific to our industry 
the following are  in our view  among the most significant of these risks and challenges we expect to face as we implement our strategy 
macro economic environment market demand for the products we sell is influenced by a variety of economic factors 
we believe general corporate profitability  white collar employment levels  new office construction rates  and existing office vacancy rates are among the most influential of these factors 
accordingly  we view these as leading economic indicators 
history has shown that changes in these factors can have an adverse effect not only on the overall demand within our industry  but also on our dealer network 
significant economic pressure on our dealer network could result in disruptions in our distribution channels and increased credit risk associated with our existing dealer financing arrangements 
commodity prices the costs of certain direct materials used in our manufacturing and assembly operations are sensitive to shifts in commodity market prices 
in particular  the costs of steel components  plastics  and particleboard are sensitive to the market prices of commodities such as raw steel  crude oil  lumber  and resins 
increases in the market prices for these commodities can have an adverse impact on our profitability 
international competition in recent years we have seen an increased market presence from international competitors 
we expect this to continue  particularly in the area of low priced imports into the united states 
supply base to minimize the risk of interruption to our business  we continue to seek financially strong suppliers interested in long term business relationships 
generally this effort  in connection with hmps  has resulted in improved efficiency  costs  and reliability 
despite these benefits  the strategy does increase the risks associated with supplier transitions and dependence upon fewer suppliers 
future avenues of growth we believe we are well positioned to successfully pursue our mission despite the risks and challenges we face 
that is  we believe we can continue to invent solutions that create great places 
in pursuing this success  we have identified the following as key avenues for our future growth 
primary markets capturing additional market share within our existing primary markets by offering superior solutions to customers who value space as a strategic tool 
adjacent markets applying our core skills in new space environments such as healthcare  higher education  and residential 
developing economies expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential 
new markets developing new products and technologies that serve wholly new markets 
industry performance the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we closely monitor the trade statistics reported by bifma and consider them among the key indicators of industry wide sales and order performance 
we also analyze bifma statistical information over several quarters as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic business 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of many considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions fiscal was a year marked by positive change for our business 
it began with a smooth transition of leadership  as brian walker assumed the role of chief executive officer 
throughout the year we continued to see signs of optimism in the economic outlook for our industry 
legislative developments during the period opened the chance at both a new market opportunity and enhanced financial flexibility 
in addition  we were successful in our first year effort to comply with the demanding requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
perhaps the most positive changes  however  were the significant financial improvements we made during the year  which were highlighted by double digit sales growth and even higher percentage increases in profitability 
the macro economic indicators of our industry showed general improvement during the year  giving us reason to be optimistic about the future 
bifma issued a report in may providing historical quarterly data on a variety of economic measures including corporate profitability  service sector employment  and office vacancy rates  each of which showed an improving trend over the past year 
the report included domestic industry forecast data through calendar year implying an expectation of continued sales and order growth 
in particular  the report cited a strong outlook for business capital investment and employment as the primary drivers of the forecast 
we were also pleased to see favorable developments on the legislative front during the year 
in december  president bush signed into law the consolidated appropriations bill 
this was exciting news within our industry because the bill contains a provision that effectively puts an end to the furniture sourcing monopoly long enjoyed by federal prison industries  inc  in supplying office furniture to certain federal government agencies 
with the passage of this legislation  we  along with the others in our industry  will have an opportunity to compete fairly for these government contracts 
the american jobs creation act  signed into law in october  provides us businesses with certain tax incentives aimed at encouraging investment and employment growth 
the provisions of this legislation provide us with added financial flexibility  specifically in the area of utilizing cash reserves held at our foreign subsidiaries 
throughout fiscal we were pleased to see an increase in customer interest and overall business activity 
client visits to our west michigan headquarters increased more than from the prior year 
we also saw an increase in the number of project proposal opportunities during the year 
finally  showroom attendance at the june neocon trade show in chicago was up from while these are clearly encouraging signs for the direction of our business  the best evidence of improving conditions was our actual financial performance during the fiscal year 
we experienced net sales growth from the prior year across virtually all areas of our business 
in fact  our net sales for the year of  million were the highest since fiscal  the year when the industry downturn began 
new order activity during fiscal was also significantly improved from a year ago 
as a result  our backlog at may   was at its highest level for a fiscal year end since may the current year growth in sales and orders was complemented by a year over year improvement in profitability 
our gross margin percentage improved points from the fiscal level 
we also saw a year over year decline in our operating expenses  as a percent of net sales 
while the restructuring actions we took between fiscal and were difficult  they played a critical role in delivering profitable growth in the current year 
despite these favorable developments and improvements  we had our challenges during the year 
among the most significant of these were increasing prices for key manufacturing materials 
throughout the year  the cost of direct materials  especially steel components  negatively affected gross margins 
higher steel prices relative to those in the prior year added an estimated million to million to our fiscal direct material expenses 
we also experienced cost increases for oil based products such as plastics and resins as a result of the general upward trend in crude oil prices 
in august we announced a general price increase  which varied by product line but averaged approximately of list price 
this change was made in response to the rapid increase in direct materials prices 
in total  we estimate our fiscal net sales increased between million and million  net of increased domestic discounting  as a result of the august price change 
in may we announced another general increase  again in response to the rise in direct material prices 
this price change will be effective in september and averages approximately of list 
we believe these pricing decisions  in combination with our hmps initiatives  will cover a large portion of the increased direct material costs in the near term 
we continue to operate in a highly competitive pricing environment 
a critical part of our business strategy in addressing competitive price pressure is to utilize innovative product design to differentiate us and provide more value to our customers 
in doing so  we hope to demonstrate that price is but one of several important factors to consider in the buying decision 
with this goal in mind  we continue to invest in new product development 
design and research expenses  including royalty payments to independent designers  totaled million in fiscal we introduced a redesign of our abak system a freestanding desk system to the us market at the neocon tradeshow in june then  later in the year  we introduced the cella chair and babble technology 
we are encouraged by the response to abak  which we made available for order in late fiscal we believe cella  the newest addition to our line of high performance office seating  will set a new reference point for price and performance 
cella  which utilizes a new seating suspension technology  earned a best of neocon innovation award 
another best of neocon winner  babble which remixes voice sounds to keep conversations private represents an innovation from herman miller creative office  our division aimed at creating technologies to serve current and new markets 
restructuring activities pre tax restructuring charges totaling million  million  and million were recognized during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the following is a breakdown by category of these charges 
in millions severance and outplacement asset impairments pension related lease and supplier contract terminations facility exit costs and other total the majority of our fiscal restructuring expenses related to the previously announced and completed relocation of our canton  georgia  operation 
the charges resulted principally from pension related settlements  which are recognized as terminated employees withdraw their assets from the retirement plan  and building carrying costs on the canton facility 
charges in fiscal year also related primarily to the canton relocation 
in addition  during that time we recorded expenses related to the consolidation of our holland  michigan  formcoat operation into existing space in nearby zeeland  michigan 
these charges were partially offset by a gain on the sale of our holland chair plan facility as well as adjustments to the expected sub lease timing for facilities previously exited under our restructuring plan 
fixed asset impairment charges resulting from the canton and formcoat actions comprised the majority of our fiscal restructuring expenses 
the remaining expense in that period related mainly to additional workforce reductions 
these remaining charges were offset  in part  by a gain from the sale of our rocklin  california  facility 
our canton facility remains listed for sale 
we have an interested buyer  but have not yet reached a point where the buyer s commitment has become binding 
therefore  the carrying values of the canton assets  which were previously reduced to their estimated fair market values totaling million  remain classified as long term assets under the balance sheet caption net property and equipment at may  we may recognize additional restructuring charges in the future as we incur the remaining costs associated with previously announced actions 
we expect that such charges would relate primarily to employee pension benefits 
the remaining pension related restructuring expenses yet to be recognized total approximately million 
however  it is difficult to estimate when these expenses will be recorded since the timing depends on when the related plan assets are withdrawn 
cash outflows related to our restructuring activities totaled approximately million in fiscal this compares to outflows of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect future cash outflows will relate mainly to carrying costs and lease obligations on previously exited facilities and will total between million to million 
this amount  the majority of which will likely be incurred during fiscal  does not include cash proceeds from the potential future sale of our canton facility 
financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated

consolidated net sales  orders  and backlog we had double digit year over year growth in net sales for each quarterly period in fiscal for the full year  we averaged approximately million per week in net sales compared to million in as business conditions steadily improved through the year  we saw our rate of sales trend upward 
this resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately between the first and second half of the fiscal year 
net trade orders totaled  million in fiscal this compares to  million and  million in fiscal and  respectively 
on a weekly average basis  new orders for the full year totaled million  an amount which slightly outpaced net sales 
unlike net sales  however  we did not see an increase in our rate of new orders between the first and second half of the year 
in fact  our average weekly order rate declined slightly between these periods 
this reflects what we have traditionally experienced as a seasonal decline in orders due to the holiday period as well as the acceleration of order activity in the first half due to the timing of the federal government fiscal year end 
the ending consolidated backlog at may  totaled million 
this represents an increase of from million at the end of fiscal the consolidation of variable interest entities vie s in connection with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r increased our fiscal net sales and orders by approximately million and million  respectively 
our fiscal ending consolidated backlog included amounts related to our remaining vie totaling approximately million 
this compares to vie related backlog of approximately million at the end of last year 
refer to the cumulative effect of accounting change section of this report for further information on our adoption of fin r at the end of fiscal domestic operations our fiscal domestic net sales totaled  million 
this represents an increase of from sales of  million in fiscal new orders in the current year totaled  million compared to  million in an increase of 
sales and order increases were experienced to varying degrees across the majority of our domestic operations 
domestic net sales and orders in fiscal totaled  million and  million  respectively 
the markets in which we do business remain highly competitive 
as we expected  price discounting continued to place negative pressure on our sales and profitability during fiscal while we were successful in capturing a portion of the price increase implemented in august  higher domestic price discounting offset some of its positive effect 
we expect this pricing pressure to continue 
accordingly  we anticipate that increased discounting in fiscal will partially offset our planned september price increase 
while it is difficult to measure shifts in market share without looking at sales and order data over a period of several quarters  we believe our performance relative to that of the domestic industry as reported by bifma provides evidence that our market share is moving in a positive direction 
our domestic net sales growth in fiscal exceeded the bifma reported data by approximately percentage points 
for the same period  our growth in domestic new orders was approximately percentage points higher than the industry 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased an additional interest in our philadelphia based dealership  op spectrum llp spectrum  for million 
this purchase increased our ownership stake in the entity to 
as a result of the transaction  we began consolidating the dealership s financial statements in august at that time  we began recognizing as minority interest the percentage of income or loss that is attributed to the minority owner of the dealership 
prior to the transaction  we accounted for our investment on the equity method  with our ownership proportion of the resulting gains or losses reported as a component of other income expense 
the consolidation of spectrum increased our fiscal and net sales by approximately million and million  respectively 
international operations and exports from the united states net sales at our international operations totaled million  making it a financial highlight for the second consecutive year 
this performance represents an increase of from sales of million in in fiscal  international net sales totaled million 
we experienced significant sales increases during the current fiscal year in the majority of our international markets with the exception of japan  a region that showed growth for us last year 
sales growth in the current year was particularly strong in the united kingdom  canada  mexico  australia  and singapore 
in total  sales from our international operations represented approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal this compares to in fiscal and in fiscal the weakening of the us dollar  particularly against the british pound  had an inflationary effect on our international net sales 
we estimate the year over year change in exchange rates effectively increased the us dollar value of our fiscal net sales by approximately million 
it is important to note that these changes in exchange rates generally have a similar inflationary effect on our international cost structure 
in other words  the us dollar value of our international expenses increased relative to prior year levels as a result of the weakening us dollar during fiscal we experienced a significant improvement in profitability at our international operations during fiscal the year ended may  marked our third consecutive year of profitable international results 
net earnings for totaled approximately million compared with million last year and million in fiscal percent of net sales analysis the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales

gross margin the combination of increased sales and improved manufacturing efficiency helped bring our fiscal consolidated gross margin to its highest annual level in four years 
the significant increase in net sales  bolstered in part by the august price increase  drove much of the improvement in the current year as we were better able to leverage fixed manufacturing costs 
we also benefited from a full year of the operating efficiencies gained from our restructuring plan 
this resulted in a notable reduction in direct labor and manufacturing overhead expenses as measured on a percent of sales basis 
these improvements were achieved in the current year despite higher direct material costs  higher incentive compensation expenses attributable to improved profitability  and increased competitive pricing pressure compared to the prior year 
direct material costs in fiscal increased from the prior year on both a dollar and percent of sales basis 
as discussed  we experienced significant direct material price increases in the period  particularly in the area of steel components 
we estimate the increased market price of steel alone reduced our current year consolidated gross margin  as a percent of net sales  by as much as percentage points 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we began realizing the labor and overhead cost benefits of consolidating our canton  georgia  operation into existing space in west michigan 
these benefits continued through the current year 
as a result  our fiscal direct labor costs as a percent of net sales were down significantly from last year 
our financial performance in the area of manufacturing overhead also improved from the prior year 
higher current year sales volume allowed us to better leverage our fixed manufacturing costs 
also  unlike last year  during fiscal we experienced a full year of cost savings from the canton consolidation 
these factors combined to significantly lower our overhead percent of sales in the period  despite higher year over year incentive compensation and employee benefit expenses 
pretax variable compensation expense included in our fiscal cost of sales totaled million compared to million in and million in the decline in gross margin between fiscal years and was attributable to several factors including higher fiscal price discounting  increasing material costs  labor inefficiencies during the relocation of the canton operation  and an increase in incentive bonus expense between years 
operating expenses and operating earnings on april   we reported that we had reached a settlement with the general services administration gsa concerning a prior audit of the to multiple award schedule contract 
in light of the settlement  which required us to pay the gsa million  we performed a complete re evaluation of our balance sheet reserves related to all gsa contract periods 
as a result of this work  we made the determination that these reserves should be reduced 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to the reserves  which reduced our pre tax operating expenses by approximately million 
exclusive of this adjustment  sg a expenses in fiscal increased by approximately million or from the prior year level 
a significant portion of this increase related to higher current year spending on marketing activities related to new product launches as well as in categories that vary with sales volume such as sales incentive compensation and royalties 
another factor contributing to the year over year expense increase was the consolidation of additional dealership financial results in the current year 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of office interiors  inc  a contract furniture dealership based in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
the operations of this dealership are now being run by one of our existing owned dealers 
also in the first quarter  we began consolidating the financial operations of a separate independent dealer considered a vie under fin r 
the consolidation of these dealers increased our total fiscal operating expenses by approximately million 
we also had higher incentive compensation expenses in the current year 
these costs vary based upon our financial performance 
pretax variable compensation expense included in our current year operating expenses totaled million 
this compares to million last year and million in fiscal design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
these expenses include royalty payments paid to designers of our products as the products are sold 
we consider such royalty payments  which totaled million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively  to be variable costs of the products being sold 
accordingly  we do not include them in research and development costs as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate that year over year changes in foreign currency exchange rates added approximately million to our fiscal operating expenses relative to the prior year 
the comparable increase in our fiscal expenses totaled approximately million 
the significant reduction in total operating expenses between fiscal and was partially due to a million pre tax credit to sg a expenses resulting from the reversal of a previously established legal accrual 
this adjustment was recorded early in fiscal year as a result of a favorable court ruling related to a previous lawsuit 
the remaining expense reduction between and was driven primarily by lower relative compensation  benefit  depreciation  and restructuring expenses 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the sec issued a letter aimed at clarifying certain issues regarding the accounting for operating leases 
the issues discussed in the letter include the appropriate accounting treatment of leasehold improvement amortization  rent holiday periods  and landlord paid incentives for leasehold improvements 
this clarifying guidance did result in a change in the way we account for these issues  particularly with respect to rent holiday periods and landlord paid incentives 
however  the impact of this change on our consolidated financial statements was not material 
our fiscal operating earnings of million represented a million improvement over the prior year 
on a percent of sales basis  this was our highest level of operating earnings since fiscal year operating earnings attributable to the consolidation of vies under fin r totaled approximately million in fiscal fiscal operating earnings were not affected by the consolidation of vies due to our timing of adoption of this accounting standard 
other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in and million in current year interest expense was slightly lower than the prior year due to lower overall debt levels 
additionally  fiscal interest income was higher than the prior year due to the impact of comparatively higher interest rates on our cash and investment balances 
the year over year decline between and was caused primarily by an accounting charge related to our investment in spectrum  a contract furniture dealership in philadelphia  as discussed below 
lower fiscal interest charges also contributed to the decline 
changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting transaction gains between years partially offset the decline 
we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain in fiscal of approximately million 
this compares to net gains of approximately million in the prior year and million in fiscal during  we recognized a million pretax charge related to the impairment of our equity investment in spectrum 
as previously discussed  we increased our ownership stake in this dealer during the first quarter of fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal was 
this compares to last year and in fiscal the rate in the current year was higher than the to range we had previously expected 
the most significant driver of this increase was a tax charge  recorded in the fourth quarter  related to our planned cash repatriation under the american jobs creation act ajca 
last year  president bush signed into law the ajca  which created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an dividend received deduction 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we finalized our plan to repatriate a portion of our international cash reserves under this new legislation 
in previous periods  we considered this income permanently invested outside of the us  and accordingly  we were not required to provide for us taxes on these funds 
as a result of this plan  we recorded tax expense of approximately million in anticipation of repatriating approximately million 
also in the fourth quarter  we recorded tax true ups  caused by recent changes in certain tax laws  as well as other federal  state  and international deferred tax adjustments 
our effective tax rate for fiscal included a million benefit from the release of tax reserves as a result of the closure of irs audits for the years   and we expect our effective tax rate in the future to range between and 
cumulative effect of accounting change we adopted fin r at the end of fiscal this new accounting standard broadened the rules for determining whether a company is required to consolidate the financial statements of another entity 
fin r required us to consolidate the financial statements of two independent contract furniture dealerships to which we have provided ongoing financial support through loans and or financial guarantees 
as a result of this consolidation  our fiscal consolidated statement of operations included a non cash cumulative effect loss of million  or slightly less than per share  net of tax 
as this new accounting standard was adopted at the end of fiscal  the consolidation had no material impact on our fiscal consolidated statement of operations beyond that of the cumulative effect 
during the first quarter of fiscal  a qualifying triggering event occurred with one of the vies which resulted in reconsideration under fin r 
based on this reconsideration  we determined that we were no longer considered the primary beneficiary 
as such  we recorded the ownership transition and ceased consolidation of the dealership in the first quarter of fiscal this resulted in a pre tax gain of million  which we recorded as other expenses income in the consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with this ownership transition we incurred a million cash outflow in the first quarter of fiscal related to the extinguishment of the outstanding bank debt of the vie 
the consolidation of the remaining vie increased both total assets and liabilities as of may   by approximately million 
at may   consolidation of the two vies increased our assets by approximately million and liabilities by million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on fin r 
change in accounting principle at the beginning of fiscal  we converted a portion of our remaining fifo based domestic inventories to lifo for inventory valuation purposes 
due to the facility rationalization and consolidation resulting from our restructuring activities in and prior  we determined it was more appropriate to account for these inventories using the lifo method 
there was no cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle  and the impact on our fiscal results was not material 
net earnings net earnings totaled million in fiscal or per diluted share 
this includes income of approximately per share  net of taxes  from the adjustment to gsa reserves as previously discussed 
in addition  net earnings per diluted share was reduced by approximately from taxes related to the anticipated repatriation under the ajca 
in fiscal  we generated net earnings of million or per share after the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting change 
this includes earnings of approximately per diluted share from the million favorable adjustment to tax reserves as previously discussed 
net earnings in fiscal totaled million or per share 
the per share impact of restructuring charges recognized during fiscal years   and totaled approximately   and  net of taxes  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights for the fiscal years indicated 
in millions cash and cash equivalents  end of period short term investments  end of period cash generated from operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for financing activities restructuring related cash outflows pension plan contributions capital expenditures stock repurchased and retired interest bearing debt  end of period available unsecured credit facility  end of period amounts shown are net of outstanding letters of credit  which are applied against the company s unsecured credit facility  excluding the million accordion feature disclosed in note during fiscal  the company entered into a new revolving credit facility 
cash flow operating activities cash flows generated from operating activities in fiscal increased over the same period last year 
this was principally driven by the year over year improvement in net earnings  favorable changes in working capital balances  and lower current year cash outflows related to previous restructuring actions 
changes in working capital balances during fiscal increased cash flows from operations by million 
increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for employee compensation and benefits and income taxes drove much of the working capital benefit during the year 
partially offsetting these favorable balance changes were volume related increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
our inventory and accounts receivable balances increased from the beginning of the current year due to the general growth in the business 
as expected  inventories did decline from the end of our second quarter due in large part to the seasonal timing of federal government project completions 
collections of accounts receivable remained strong throughout the year and we believe our recorded accounts receivable valuation allowances as of may   are adequate to cover the risk of potential bad debts 
our average days sales outstanding dso in net inventory and accounts receivable for the last quarter of the year improved to at the end of the year from a year ago and in fiscal allowances for non collectible accounts receivable  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled   and as of the end of fiscal   and  respectively 
the reduction in the current year percentage was driven by an overall improvement in the quality of our accounts receivable aging 
during fiscal year  changes in working capital balances resulted in a net use of cash totaling million 
in that period  we experienced a decrease in accrued income taxes and increases in both accounts receivable and inventories 
these negative factors were partially offset by a production driven increase in accounts payable  increased compensation and benefit accruals  and favorable changes in deferred taxes 
by contrast  in fiscal we received a significant working capital cash flow benefit  mainly driven by a net increase in accrued income taxes and declines in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
restructuring related cash payments and contributions to our employee pension plans made during the past three fiscal years had the effect of reducing cash flows from operating activities in each period 
cash flow investing activities capital expenditures accounted for the majority of the investing outflows during fiscal years and also included in net cash flows used in investing activities were payments for acquisitions  which totaled million in the current year related to office interiors  inc  and million in the prior year related to spectrum 
these acquisitions are discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our fiscal cash outflows from investing activities are net of proceeds received from the sale of the holland  michigan  chair plant facility in connection with our restructuring plan 
these proceeds totaled million and were received in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  net cash outflows were comprised primarily of capital expenditures offset by proceeds of approximately million related to the sale of two properties exited in connection with our restructuring plan 
as of the end of fiscal year  we had outstanding commitments for future capital purchases of approximately million 
we expect full year capital expenditures in to total between million and million 
a large portion of the planned increase over the current year is due to the scheduled construction of a new office facility and showroom in the united kingdom as well as new product launches 
cash flow financing activities in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired    cost of shares acquired average cost per share acquired shares issued    average price per share issued cash dividends dividends paid per share share repurchases proved to be the most significant factor affecting the comparison of financing outflows between fiscal and this increase in share repurchase activity was the result of a capital structure plan approved by our board of directors during the third quarter of last year  which provided for an additional share repurchase authorization of million 
we received yet another share repurchase authorization of million from our board of directors during fiscal as of may   we had approximately million remaining for future repurchases 
the increase in dividend payments between fiscal years and was the result of a increase in our quarterly dividend rate to per share  as announced in april partially offsetting the cash flow effects of share repurchases and dividend payments was cash received related to stock based benefit plans 
in the current year  we received approximately million  net of million tax  from the issuance of shares in connections with these plans 
by comparison  we received approximately million  net of million tax  from the issuance of shares in fiscal in fiscal year  these amounts totaled million  net of million tax 
we attribute the current year increase in share issuance activity mainly to the increase in the market price of our common stock  which moved from per share at the end of last year to per share at the end of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we paid off a million note balance associated with a vie consolidated under fin r 
we also made a scheduled million payment during the year on our private placement notes 
we expect to make another million payment on these private placement notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal debt repayments made during fiscal and totaled million and million  respectively 
interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal declined million from a balance of million at the end of last year 
while the majority of this decline was due to the debt payments described above  a portion of it also related to a decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap arrangements during the period 
the combined fair values of the interest rate swap arrangements  as described in note  was negligible as of the end of may  this compares to a negative million at the end of fiscal the fair values of these swap arrangements change based on fluctuations in market interest rates 
such changes are not included in net earnings for the period 
instead  they are reflected as adjustments to our consolidated assets and or liabilities 
at the end of fiscal  the portion of our total interest bearing debt that was effectively converted to a variable rate basis through our swap arrangements totaled million 
interest expense savings resulting from these arrangements totaled approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal during fiscal we entered into a new million unsecured five year revolving credit agreement 
the agreement has an accordion feature that may enable the credit facility to be increased by an additional million 
the new arrangement replaced our previous million bank facility scheduled to expire in april outstanding borrowings under the new agreement incur interest at rates based on the prime  certificates of deposit  libor  or negotiated rates 
the only usage against our unsecured credit facilities at the end of fiscal and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
the provisions of our private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require that we adhere to certain covenant restrictions and maintain certain performance ratios 
we were in compliance with all such restrictions and performance ratios during the current year and expect to remain so in the future 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund our future business operations and capital needs 
contingencies we have received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office requesting certain information relating to the minimum advertised price program maintained by our herman miller for the home division 
we are cooperating with the new york attorney general s office in this matter 
at this time  as there has been no claim asserted in connection with this matter  we have no reasonable basis on which to estimate the financial impact  if any  of this investigation 
we currently lease a facility in the uk under an agreement that expires in january under the terms of the lease  we are required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate financial cost to us of this provision will be dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether we choose and are permitted to renew the lease term 
we have estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is considered probable that these costs will approximate million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liability reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of may  for a number of years  we have sold various products to the united states government under gsa multiple award schedule contracts 
under the terms of these contracts  the gsa is permitted to audit our compliance with the gsa contracts 
we have occasionally noted errors in complying with contract provisions 
from time to time we have notified the gsa of known instances of non compliance whether favorable or unfavorable to the gsa once such circumstances are identified and investigated 
we do not believe that any of the errors brought to the gsa s attention will adversely affect our relationship with the gsa 
currently there are no gsa audits either scheduled or in process 
refer to note for discussion of a settlement reached with the gsa in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which relates to previous audits of the to contract years 
we do not expect resolution of potential future audits to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is our opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation fiscal years   and each contained weeks 
this is the basis upon which all of the above weekly average data is presented 
our fiscal year  which began may   will have weeks 
this is required approximately every six years in order to re align our fiscal calendar end dates with the actual calendar months 
contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods 
the following table summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments 
further information regarding debt obligations can be found in note of the consolidated financial statements 
likewise  further information related to operating leases can be found in note in millions payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt  estimated interest on debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations pension plan funding shareholder dividends  other  total amounts indicated do not include the recorded fair value of interest rate swap instruments 
estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations are based on interest rates as of may  actual cash outflows may differ significantly due to changes in underlying interest rates and timing of principal payments 
purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension funding commitments are defined as the expected minimum funding requirements and planned voluntary contributions to be made in the following month period 
as of may   the total accumulated benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million 
represents the recorded dividend payable as of may  future dividend payments are not considered contractual obligations until declared 
other contractual obligations represent long term commitments related to deferred employee compensation benefits  minimum designer royalty payments  and scheduled commitments related to the acquisition of intellectual property rights 
total balance is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at may  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities on occasion  we provide financial support to certain dealers in the form of term loans  lines of credit  and or loan guarantees 
at may   we were considered the primary beneficiary of one such relationship due to the nature of our variable interest in this entity as further discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we also hold variable interests in other dealerships where we are not the primary beneficiary 
the risks and rewards associated with our interests in these other dealerships are primarily limited to our outstanding loans and guarantee amounts 
as of may   our maximum exposure to potential losses related to financing provided to these other entities totaled million 
information on our exposure related to outstanding loan guarantees provided to such entities is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we attempt to report our financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or to owned dealers  revenue is recognized once the product and services are delivered and installation is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates 
receivable allowances we base our allowances related to receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves could be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
this year over year reduction is attributable to the overall improvement in the quality of our accounts receivable aging 
goodwill the net carrying value of our goodwill assets at may   totaled million 
we account for our goodwill assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
under this accounting guidance  we are required to perform an annual test on our goodwill assets  by reporting unit  to determine whether the asset values are impaired 
if impairment is determined  we are required to recognize a charge sufficient to reduce the net carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
our impairment testing model is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
in completing the test under this approach  we assume that the value of a business today is derived from the cash flow it will generate in the future 
we also assume that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect our best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows may differ significantly 
the results of this test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  indicated that our net goodwill asset values were not impaired 
our testing employed an assumed discount rate  which we set at 
we believe this level is conservative in that it exceeds our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
changes to the discount rate used in this analysis have a significant impact on the results of the impairment test 
our analysis indicates that we could increase this discount rate by more than a full percentage point before the results of the test indicated a potential impairment issue 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct or replace problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuations of such reserves are based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and result in an adjustment to our reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using first in  first out method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and a component of judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
we also have foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we establish reserves for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on actuarially determined expected future claims 
we also establish reserves for health benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
we also maintain certain insurance coverage for risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
we utilize the services of an independent actuarial firm to analyze and recommend an appropriate rate 
for our domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a bond matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to various corporate bond portfolios with similar cash flow durations 
we set the discount rate for our international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate is based on a recommendation from our independent actuarial consultant after taking into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations 
the discount rates established for our pension and post retirement benefit plans at the end of fiscal were lower than those established at the end of fiscal with all other assumptions and values held constant  this change would result in an increase in our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses for our fiscal year  which began on may  interest crediting rate we use this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant s account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
we base this methodology on the historical spread between the us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is appropriate 
expected long term rate of return we base this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
we consider risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents our long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an unrecognized actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an unrecognized actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of may   and may   the net unrecognized actuarial loss associated with our employee retirement plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
in both periods  the majority of this unrecognized loss was associated with less than expected plan asset returns 
for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  we use a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  we recognize the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a large portion of our net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
we currently estimate this period to be approximately years 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  the deferred net actuarial loss ie  the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired businesses for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation we view stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain of our employees and non employee directors 
we account for these plans  which include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  and stock options  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb 
under this guidance we recognize compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock and stock units 
for stock options issuances  we do not recognize compensation expense when the stock options are granted to employees and directors at fair market value as of the grant date 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas  we have been disclosing in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the pro forma impact on net earnings and earnings per share had we recognized expense related to stock option based compensation 
these pro forma disclosures require us to estimate a fair value for each stock option issued 
in completing this valuation  we utilize an option pricing model that requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of our common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
certain assumptions affecting stock based compensation are described below 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of our common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider dispersion in the expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
for purposes of determining our pro forma footnote disclosure in fiscal year  we have assumed expected volatilities of between and 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
for fiscal year  we assumed average expected option lives of between and years in calculating our pro forma footnote disclosure 
refer to notes   and for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans as well as the effective date of recently issued accounting guidance that will require us to recognize compensation expense on grants of stock options beginning with our fiscal year 
new accounting standards in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp  in response to the act signed into law on december  the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the provisions of fsp provide guidance on the accounting treatment and required disclosures relating to the effects of the act 
this guidance supersedes fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of 
fsp is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we adopted fsp at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal refer to note for further discussion 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  as such  we are required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
under sfas r  a public entity generally is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with such cost recognized over the applicable vesting period 
this new accounting treatment is also required for any share based payments to the company s board of directors 
as defined within the transition provisions of sfas r  public entities are required to adopt this new method of accounting using the modified prospective method and may elect to restate prior periods using the modified retrospective method 
sfas r also requires an entity to provide certain disclosures in order to assist in understanding the nature of share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
on april   the sec announced that it would provide for phased in implementation of sfas r 
under this provision registrants are required adopt sfas r no later than the beginning of the fiscal year beginning after june  as such  we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas r at the beginning of fiscal refer to note for disclosure of the pro forma earnings effects of our stock based awards 
we are currently evaluating the impact the implementation guidance and revisions included in sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
this statement amends apb  eliminating the exception to the fair value principle for exchanges of similar productive assets  which had been accounted for based on the book value of the assets surrendered with no gain recognition 
the general requirement under apb that nonmonetary exchanges of assets be accounted for at fair value with gain or loss recognition was left intact  as long as the exchange has commercial substance and the fair value is determinable 
the provisions of sfas should be applied prospectively  effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  as such  we are required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp and  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
this guidance was issued in response to the american jobs creation act of that was signed into law by the president in october these new standards were effective upon issuance  during the third quarter of fiscal refer to note for further discussion of the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the sec office of the chief accountant issued a letter to clarify the staff s interpretation regarding the accounting for operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles 
issues covered in this clarification include the amortization of leasehold improvements  rent holidays  and landlord tenant incentives 
the sec staff believes that its positions are based upon existing accounting literature  and as such  any registrants who determine their accounting for leases in prior periods to be in error should issue a restatement of results from the correction of any such errors  if deemed significant 
we have reevaluated our accounting for leases and determined that the impact of this clarification on our consolidated financial statements was not material in fiscal or in prior periods 
refer to note for further information regarding our operating leases 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under fin  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
any uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value 
the provisions of fin are required to be applied no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december   although early adoption is encouraged 
as such  we are required to adopt fin by the end of fiscal and are currently evaluating its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management s belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions  the pace of economic recovery in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  the types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  the success of the transition to our new executive management team  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast 
furthermore  herman miller  inc takes no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials used in its manufacturing processes 
the largest direct material costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastic textiles  and wood particleboard components 
during fiscal year  the market price of steel rose significantly 
as a result  the company estimates its direct material costs for steel in that period increased between million and million over the previous year 
the market price of plastic components is sensitive to the cost of oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices increased sharply during the latter half of fiscal year and the company expects this will likely have a negative effect on the price of plastics and textiles in the near term 
in addition to the market dynamics of supply and demand  the cost of wood particleboard is sensitive to the impact of oil prices on resins and physical transportation 
foreign exchange risk the company manufactures its products in the united states and the united kingdom 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company s completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company s reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company s competitive positions within these markets 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  and mexican peso 
favorable foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal resulted in increased earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million 
additionally  the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity was reduced during fiscal by million as a result of these changes 
by comparison  currency fluctuations in fiscal resulted in increased pretax earnings of million and reduced accumulated other comprehensive loss by million 
interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an incentive to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it 
the company has three separate interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert million in total of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis at the end of the fiscal year 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instruments are held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
they are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these swap instruments are large financial institutions that the company believes are of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by these counterparties  such losses are not anticipated 
the swap arrangements resulted in a reduction of net interest expense of approximately million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as of may   the combined fair market values of the swap instruments was less than million 
all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap agreements are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as of may   the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt was approximately 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding as of that date  a percentage point increase in the weighted average interest rate would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows 
in millions thereafter total long term debt fixed rate wtd 
average interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay variable receive fixed pay interest rate at may  received interest rate pay variable receive fixed pay interest rate at may  received interest rate pay variable receive fixed pay interest rate at may  receive interest rate amount does not include the recorded fair value of the swap instruments  which totaled less than million at the end of fiscal
