item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview bankrate  inc owns and operates an internet based consumer banking marketplace 
our flagship site  bankrate 
com  is the internet s leading aggregator of information on more than financial products  including mortgages  credit cards  new and used automobile loans  money market accounts  certificates of deposit  checking and atm fees and home equity loans 
additionally  we provide financial applications and information to a network of distribution partners and also through national and state publications 
bankrate 
com provides the tools and information that can help consumers make better financial decisions 
we regularly survey more than  financial institutions in all states in order to provide the most current objective  unbiased rates 
hundreds of print and online partner publications depend on bankrate 
com as the trusted source for financial rates and information 
over two decades ago  we began as a print publisher of the newsletter bank rate monitor 
our rate tables provide  at no cost to the consumer  a detailed list of lenders by market and include relevant details to help consumers compare loan products 
we continue to enhance our offerings in order to provide bankrate 
com users with the most complete experience 
features such as financial calculators and e mail newsletters allow users to interact with our site 
our rate trend index is a weekly poll of industry insiders designed to help consumers forecast interest rate trends 
we also broadened our offerings to include channels on investing  taxes  small business  financial advice and insurance 
each channel offers a unique look at its particular topic 
bankrate 
com users can find advice and tips from the tax channel  obtain business ideas from the small business channel and ask a financial expert a question in the advice channel 
prior to  and dating back to  our principal business was the publication of print newsletters  the syndication of unbiased editorial bank and credit product research to newspapers and magazines  and advertising sales of the consumer mortgage guide 
we currently syndicate editorial research to newspapers that have a combined single day circulation in excess of million copies  and to two national magazines with a combined monthly circulation in excess of million copies 
the consumer mortgage guide is a weekly newspaper advertising table consisting of product and rate information from local mortgage companies and financial institutions 
the consumer mortgage guide appears weekly in us metropolitan newspapers with combined single day circulation in excess of million copies  including our first tv consumer mortgage guide with a reach of million 
together  these bankrate 
com branded activities have the potential of reaching million readers according to editor publisher international year book 
in  we began our online operations by placing our editorially unbiased research on our web site  bankrate 
com 
by offering our information online  we created new revenue opportunities through the sale of graphical and hyperlink advertising associated with our rate and yield tables 
in fiscal  we implemented a strategy to concentrate on building these online operations 
we believe that the recognition of our research as a leading source of independent  objective information on banking and credit products is essential to our success 
as a result  we have sought to maximize distribution of our research to gain brand recognition as a research authority 
we are seeking to build greater brand awareness of our web site and to reach a greater number of online users 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and critical accounting policies  and note to the financial statements below for a discussion of our two reportable business segments online publishing  and print publishing and licensing 
our opportunity many financial services customers are relatively uninformed with respect to financial products and services and often rely upon personal relationships when choosing such products and services 
many of these products and services are not well explained  and viable  equivalent alternatives typically are not presented when marketed to consumers through traditional media 
as the sale of many of these products and services moves to the internet  where there is little personal contact  we believe that consumers will seek sources of independent objective information such as bankrate 
com to facilitate and support their buying decisions 
the interactive nature of the internet allows us to display extensive research on financial products and services that was previously unavailable to consumers 
we believe the majority of financial information available on the web is oriented toward investment advice and providing business news and stock market information  rather than personal and consumer finance data 
our publications are targeted to fulfill the less competitive  but equally important niches of consumer banking and finance information 
as a result  we believe we can maintain a loyal base of users comprised of targeted audiences that are attractive to advertisers 
despite weakness in advertising spending on the internet  we have seen steady interest in our primary niches mortgages  automobile loans  home equity loans and cd savings products 
in addition  we believe our faith in the long term benefits of the internet is well founded 
the ability of the internet to provide a platform for frictionless communication between consumers and businesses has not changed 
we believe bankrate  inc is positioned to benefit from any growth in the internet advertising market 
strategy we believe that the consumer banking sector holds significant opportunities for growth and expansion 
as we grow  we are seeking to consolidate our position as the industry leader in the gathering of rate data and to expand our brand recognition with consumers and partners 
elements of our strategy include continuing to provide advertisers with high quality  ready to transact consumers by advertising on our site  either through purchasing graphic ads  hyperlinks  or sponsorships  banks  brokers and other advertisers are tapping into our strongest resource  consumers on the verge of engaging in a transaction 
by allowing advertisers to efficiently access these in market consumers  we are helping advertisers lower their own costs of acquiring new customers  and ultimately creating a transaction that is beneficial for the advertiser  the consumer and us 
remaining the dominant brand in consumer bank rate data and content we are continuing our strong push to remain the dominant player in our market 
we believe we are the number one competitor in our market on a number of levels  including revenue  the number of banks surveyed  the number of pages viewed by consumers and the number of unique visitors 
continued  low risk growth through partnering with top web sites our partner network provides bankrate 
com with a steady stream of visitors  with little to no advertising risk to the company 
as the bulk of these agreements are revenue sharing  we only pay out a percentage of what we actually bring in 
we will also explore initiatives to expand the breadth and depth of our product offerings and services by partnering in the real estate  auto finance  sub prime lending and college lending areas 
zealously guarding our limited resources our greatest assets are our people  our partners and our brand 
we carefully weigh every decision for the potential impact on these three resources 
distribution arrangements our distribution or syndication arrangements with other web site operators fall into two categories co branding  in which we establish a co branded site with another web site operator  and licensing  in which we provide content to the other operator s web site together with a hyperlink to our own site 
we have found co branding to be more effective in driving traffic to our site 
co branded sites are created pursuant to agreements with other web site operators 
generally  agreements relating to co branded sites provide for us to host the co branded web pages  sell and serve the graphical advertising  and collect advertising revenues  which are shared with the third party web site 
under licensing arrangements  we provide content to other web sites in exchange for a fee 
the content identifies bankrate 
com as its source and typically includes a hyperlink to the bankrate 
com web site 
our largest partners in terms of driving traffic to our site as of december  included america online  netscape  yahoo  dollar stretcher  and compuserve 
during  approximately of the traffic to bankrate 
com was attributable to the distribution partners compared to in and in the decline results from the heightened consumer demand for mortgage product data during and into the second quarter of  driving more traffic directly to bankrate 
com 
we expect traffic from distribution partners to be between and of total site traffic in financial product research our research staff is made up of employees who track comparative information on more than financial products and services  including checking accounts  consumer loans  lines of credit  mortgages  certificates of deposit  savings accounts  credit cards  money market accounts and online accounts 
we cover both personal and small business accounts offered through branch offices and on the internet by banks  thrifts  credit unions  credit card issuers  mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers 
we estimate that over  items of data are gathered each week for more than markets across the united states from over  financial institutions 
the information obtained includes not only interest rates and yields  but also related data such as lock periods  fees  points  and loan sizes for mortgages  and grace periods  late penalties  cash advance fees  cash advance annual percentage rates  annual percentage yields  minimum payments  and terms and conditions of credit cards 
we adhere to a strict methodology in developing our markets and our institutional survey group 
the market survey includes the largest us markets  as defined by the us census bureau s metropolitan statistical area categories  along with the largest market in each state that does not include one of the largest markets and other selected communities that represent areas of growth 
we provide a comparative analysis of data by market and state as well as on a national basis 
institutions in the survey group include the largest banks and thrifts within each market area based on total deposits 
the number of institutions tracked within a given market is based on the types of financial products available and number of institutions in the market area 
in each of the largest markets  we track at least institutions 
in each of the smaller markets  we track three or more institutions 
we verify and adjust  if necessary  the institutions included in the survey group on an annual basis using fdic deposit data from year end call reports 
we do not include credit unions in the market survey group because product availability is based upon membership 
however  we track the largest us credit unions as a separate survey group for comparison purposes 
all products included in our database have narrowly defined criteria so that information provided by institutions is comparable 
the quality control process then includes several visual checks and proofing by different staff members to insure that the data inputs are accurate 
our quality control staff reviews each listing in relation to regional and national trends and for overall accuracy and consistency fees and related information prior to disclosure of the information to consumers 
the staff also reviews the comparability of products  institutional accuracy and survey accuracy 
in addition  the quality control team performs anonymous shopping on a weekly basis  whereby we place calls to institutions in order to validate the data in a consumer setting 
institutions providing invalid data are contacted by our quality control staff to ensure that future information will be accurate 
the criteria for product listings consist of specific attributes  such as loan size and term that are used to define each type of financial instrument in order to ensure uniformity in the products that are compared 
with the exception of the internet banking deals table  no special offers are listed on our site 
institutions listed in our bankrate 
com online tables that purchase hyperlinks to their own sites or purchase other advertising must comply with the same criteria for product listings that apply to other institutions or they will be removed 
all of our new research employees are provided with a four week program of on the job training to ensure consistency of data gathering and validation techniques 
follow up refresher training is provided to our research employees on an ongoing basis to ensure that skill levels are maintained 
at the end of each weekly survey  data are archived as part of our year old cumulative historical data file 
this file provides a unique resource for our financial analysts and editorial team in developing trend graphs  charts and narrative analysis that is used by national and local media 
we are aware of the potential conflict of interest resulting from the sale of advertising to financial institutions while providing independent and objective research 
however  we believe that no potential conflicts of interest have ever compromised our ability to provide independent and objective research  and we are committed to continue to provide such research in the future 
editorial content in addition to our research department  as of december   we maintained an editorial staff of editors  writers and researchers  and graphic designers who create original stories and content for our web site 
we also have relationships with more than free lance writers 
most of our editorial staff members are experienced journalists with lengthy newspaper  magazine  new media and broadcast experience 
the reporters and editors of bankrate 
com have professional journalistic work experience ranging from two to years  with an average of years of experience 
we believe the quality of our original content plays a critical role in attracting visitors to our web site and to our co branded partners web sites 
most of the content within our web site is original and produced internally 
there is a very limited amount of third party content  acquired under advertising revenue sharing agreements or licenses  which allows us to incorporate relevant information on our web site that would otherwise require additional resources to produce 
an example of this type of arrangement is the incorporation in bankrate 
com of currency conversion functionality from oanda 
com  a comprehensive provider of foreign exchange and currency trading information services 
print publications we continue to produce traditional print publications to absorb part of the cost of producing research and original editorial content 
additionally  we believe that print publishing activities contribute to greater exposure and branding opportunities for our web site 
our print publications activities include the following consumer mortgage guide we generate revenue through the sale of mortgage rate and product listings in metropolitan newspapers across the united states with combined sunday circulation of million copies 
we enter into agreements with the newspapers for blocks of print space  which is in turn sold to local mortgage lenders and we share the revenue with the newspapers on a percentage basis 
syndication of editorial content and research we syndicate editorial research to newspapers  which have a combined sunday circulation of more than million copies  and two national magazines with combined monthly circulation in excess of million copies 
newsletters we publish three newsletters highest yields and jumbo flash report  which target individual consumers  and bank rate monitor  which targets an institutional audience 
these newsletters provide bank deposit  loan and mortgage interest rate information with minimal editorial content 
consumer marketing our primary marketing expenditures are for key word cost per click advertising campaigns on internet search engines 
we also enter into barter transactions the exchange by the company of advertising space on the company s web site for reciprocal advertising space on other web sites to promote our brand and generate traffic to our web site 
during  we also used sweepstakes and promotions efforts to drive site traffic and grow our e mail newsletter subscriber base 
we actively conduct earned media public relations campaigns to promote our editorial content and personnel to the consumer and trade media 
bankrate spokespersons are routinely featured in newspapers  magazines and in broadcast media  and are promoted to and are featured as expert commentators on  major broadcast and cable news programs and talk radio 
in  our spokespersons were featured on nbc nightly news  abc world news tonight  the fox cable network  cnbc  cnn cnnfn  and numerous talk radio broadcasts 
we produce an audio minute based on our personal finance radio editorial content which is distributed to hundreds of radio stations through an arrangement with the associated press radio network 
our home page and other key pages routinely rank at or near the top of major search engines natural unpaid listings for highly coveted key words and phrases related to banking products  and we generate significant traffic and revenue from such placements 
the high rankings are largely a result of our success at creating highly relevant  widely read content  and because our personnel stay abreast of and apply best practice page optimization techniques 
advertising sales our advertising sales staff consisted of salespeople and support staff as of december   focused on selling graphic ads to national advertisers  and hyperlinks to regional and local advertisers 
our salespersons are located in our north palm beach corporate headquarters  and we also maintain offices in new york  new york and in irvine  california 
in february  we opened sales offices in san francisco  california and chicago  illinois 
each salesperson is responsible for a designated geographic region of the united states 
prior to the second half of  the advertising sales staff was organized in two groups the graphic ad team gat and the telemarketing group telemarketing 
the gat focused on selling graphic ads to national advertisers  while telemarketing primarily sold hyperlinks to regional and local advertisers 
in the second half of  the gat and telemarketing groups were combined  the sales territories were re aligned and the department was reengineered to move forward as a media advertising sales staff 
our graphic advertising sales efforts present advertising solutions to potential advertisers using inventory created by our web site as well as co branded web sites 
we believe this combined network of sites enhances value for advertisers and direct marketers by alleviating the need to purchase a series of advertising campaigns from numerous web sites  providing advertisers and direct marketers with advertising opportunities on a wide variety of web pages containing business and personal finance content  and providing targeted access to internet users with desirable demographics 
advertisers and direct marketers can enhance the effectiveness of their campaigns by customizing advertising delivery on our networks within a particular content channel or across an entire network 
advertising alternatives our advertisers can target prospective customers using several different approaches targeting specific geographic and product areas  for example  mortgage shoppers in atlanta  georgia  or just one of these all consumers interested in mortgages  or all consumers from atlanta 
focusing on consumers in specific situations  such as those who are first time home buyers  or those actively shopping for cds 
general rotation throughout our site 
our most common graphic advertisement sizes are banners x pixels and leader boards x pixels  which are prominently displayed at the top or bottom of a page  and posters x pixels  islands x pixels and badges x pixels 
we offer these advertisements which can be targeted to specific areas of our site  or on a general rotation basis 
advertising rates may vary depending upon the quantity of advertisements purchased by an advertiser and the length of time an advertiser runs an advertisement on our site 
discounts are available based upon the volume of advertisements purchased 
advertisers may also purchase sponsorship positions on the bankrate 
com home page and the main page for each product channel 
in addition  we offer product special issues that are available for single sponsorships 
rates for product special issues are based on expected impression levels and additional content requirements 
providing effective tools for managing advertising campaigns is essential to maintaining advertising relationships 
we use a state of the art program under license from a third party that allows our advertisers to monitor their spending on our web sites in real time for impressions received and click through ratios generated 
we also accept impression counts from other third parties that serve our customers advertisements such as doubleclick 
hyperlinks financial institutions that are listed in our rate tables have the opportunity to hyperlink their listings 
by clicking on the hyperlink  users are taken to the institution s web site 
a substantial benefit to advertisers with the hyperlink rate listing is that the hyperlinks are in fixed placement on the rate pages and are shown every time a user accesses a page 
in contrast  graphic advertisements are rotated based on the number of impressions purchased 
hyperlinks are sold under contracts that range primarily between three and twelve months 
the number of hyperlinked rate listings that can be added to a rate page is limited only by the number of institutions listed  while graphic advertisement positions are limited by available space 
we also sell text links on our rate pages to advertisers on a cost per click cpc basis 
advertisers enter an auction bidding process on a third party web site for placement of their text link based on the amount they are willing to pay for each click through to their web site 
we recognize revenue monthly for each text link based on the number of clicks at the cpc contracted for during the auction bidding process 
e mail sponsorships we publish six e mail newsletters ranging from specific topics such as cds  credit cards  and mortgages  to broader topics such as frugal living and personal finances 
we also send out daily alert newsletters e mails alerting subscribers every time a rate changes in mortgages or cds  or when stories are published on a particular topic 
these newsletters offer another marketing and sales outlet for us 
with over million e mail subscriptions  we believe our e mail newsletters represent attractive advertising space for our customers 
advertisers can sponsor e mails with both text and graphic ads 
advertisers we market to local advertisers targeting a specific audience in a city or state and also to national advertisers targeting the entire country 
as of december   we had graphic advertisers and hyperlink advertisers  some of which are both graphic and hyperlink advertisers 
among our larger advertisers are lowermybills 
com  ihomeowners  inc  ing direct  e loan  inc  bank of america  citibank  capital one services  inc  countrywide  and getsmart acquired by lending tree  inc providian financial corporation 
we had one online customer  getsmart providian financial corporation  who accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenue for the years ended december   and sales to no other customer exceeded of total revenue for the periods presented 
no material revenues were generated outside of the united states 
competition we compete for advertising revenues across the broad category of personal finance information  both in traditional media such as newspapers  magazines  radio  and television  and in the developing market for online financial information 
there are many competitors that have substantially greater resources than we do 
our online competition includes the following personal finance sections of general interest sites such as yahoo finance  aol personal finance and msn money  personal finance destination sites such as the motley fool  cbs marketwatch  smartmoney 
com  kiplinger 
com and cnnmoney 
com  e commerce oriented sites that include banking and credit products such as lendingtree and pricegrabber  lead aggregators such as lowermybills  ihomeowners and nextag  print mortgage table sellers like mmis and national financial news service  rate listing sites  such as monstermoving  realtor 
com  informa research services  checkinterestrates 
com carsdirect and interest 
com  and key word cost per click sites networks such as google  overture  ask jeeves and findwhat 
competition in the online segment is generally directed at growing users and revenue using marketing and promotion to increase traffic to web sites 
we believe that our original content  focus and objective product information differentiate us from our competitors 
operations we currently host our web site on proprietary servers at a secure third party co location facility in atlanta  georgia 
this facility is manned  and our equipment is monitored continuously  hours daily 
the facility is powered continuously with multiple sources  including uninterruptible power supplies and internal power generators 
the facility is connected to the internet with redundant high speed digital data lines that are diversely routed 
our web site pages are served from an independent content distribution network for performance and redundancy 
much of the information presented on our web site is stored on a triple node database server cluster also housed in the co location facility 
our systems are protected by a multi layered security system including dual high speed inspection state firewalls 
all of our systems are controlled remotely via an encrypted virtual private network vpn from our network operations center noc in our principal office in north palm beach  florida 
content on our web site is created and initially stored on systems located at the noc  then transferred at scheduled intervals during the day via the vpn to the systems at the georgia co location facility 
the north palm beach facility systems are also powered redundantly by uninterruptible power supply units 
proprietary rights our proprietary intellectual property consists of our unique research and editorial content 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  our user policy and restrictions on disclosure to protect this content 
in addition  we license some of our data and content from other parties 
our copyrights  trademarks and licenses expire at various dates  and none is individually significant 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  of which were in web site and content operations  in sales and business development  in content and data research  in advertising revenue operations  in product development and information technology  in finance and accounting  in corporate communications and marketing  and in administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be favorable 
risk factors risks related to our business our success depends on internet advertising revenue we expect to derive approximately of our revenue in the foreseeable future through the sale of advertising space and hyperlinks on our internet web pages 
any factors that limit the amount advertisers are willing to spend on advertising on our web site could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these factors may include a lack of standards for measuring web site traffic or effectiveness of web site advertising  a lack of established pricing models for internet advertising  the failure of traditional media advertisers to adopt internet advertising  the introduction of alternative advertising sources  and a lack of significant growth in web site traffic 
continuing to demonstrate the effectiveness of advertising on our web site is critical to our ability to generate advertising revenue 
currently  there are no widely accepted standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising  and we cannot be certain that such standards will develop sufficiently to support our growth through internet advertising 
a number of different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet 
pricing models are typically either cpm based or performance based 
we predominantly utilize the cpm based model  which is based upon the number of advertisement impressions 
the performance based  or per click  model generates payments on each individual click even though it may take multiple advertisement impressions to generate one click through 
we cannot predict which pricing model  if any  will emerge as the industry standard 
therefore  it is difficult for us to project our future advertising rates and revenues 
for instance  banner advertising  which is one of our primary sources of online revenue  may not be an effective advertising method in the future 
if we are unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising and pricing models  our business could be adversely affected 
financial services companies account for a majority of our advertising revenues 
we will need to sell advertising to customers outside of the financial services industry in order to significantly increase our revenues 
if we do not attract advertisers from other industries  revenue growth could be adversely affected 
we use barter transactions  which do not generate cash we enter into barter transactions to promote our brand and generate traffic to our web site without spending any of our cash resources 
barter transactions represent the exchange by the company of advertising space on the company s web site for reciprocal advertising space on other web sites 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized as income when advertisements are delivered on the company s web site 
barter expenses are recognized when the company s advertisements are run on the other companies web sites  which typically are in the same period in which barter revenues are recognized 
barter transactions  however  do not generate cash 
limited cash flow may adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and satisfy liabilities 
revenue from barter transactions represented approximately   and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect barter revenue to represent approximately of our total revenue in the our success depends on interest rate volatility we provide interest rate information for mortgages and other loans  credit cards and savings accounts 
visitor traffic to bankrate 
com tends to increase with interest rate movements and decrease with interest rate stability 
factors that have caused significant visitor fluctuations in the past have been federal reserve board actions and general market conditions affecting home mortgage interest rates 
additionally  the level of traffic to bankrate 
com can be dependent on interest rate levels as well as mortgage re financing activity 
accordingly  a slowdown in mortgage production volumes could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that as we continue to develop our web site with broader personal finance topics  the percentage of overall traffic seeking mortgage information will remain stabilized at current levels 
to accelerate the growth of traffic to bankrate 
com  we are working with our syndication partners to program more intensively  and we are aggressively promoting bankrate 
com products not related to mortgage activity 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 
our success depends on establishing and maintaining distribution arrangements our business strategy includes the distribution of our content through the establishment of co branded web pages with high traffic business and personal finance sections of online services and web sites 
a co branded site is typically a custom version of our web site with the graphical look  feel  and navigation  of the co branded partner s web site 
providing access to these co branded web pages is a significant part of the value we offer to our advertisers 
we compete with other internet content providers to maintain our current relationships with other web site operators and establish new relationships 
in addition  as we expand our personal finance content  some of these web site operators may perceive us as a competitor 
as a result  they may be unwilling to promote distribution of our banking and credit content 
we cannot guarantee that our distribution arrangements will attract a sufficient number of users to support our current advertising model 
in addition  our business could be adversely affected if we do not establish and maintain distribution arrangements on favorable economic terms 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and could even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows accounting for share based payments  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for business combinations and related goodwill 
in particular  in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to directors and employees  including stock option grants  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r will have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results and may impact the way in which we conduct our business 
changes in  or interpretations of  tax rules and regulations may adversely impact our effective tax rate unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 
risks related to our industry  the internet and our technology infrastructure our future success is dependent upon increased acceptance of the internet by consumers as a medium for obtaining financial product information our success will depend in large part on continued and expanded widespread consumer acceptance of obtaining rate information regarding financial products such as mortgages  credit cards  money market accounts  certificates of deposit  checking and atm fees  home equity loans  online banking fees and new and used auto loans online 
increased consumer use of the internet to provide for their lending needs is subject to uncertainty 
the development of an online market for obtaining rate information regarding the above listed financial products is rapidly evolving and likely will be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
if consumer acceptance of the internet as a source for such information does not increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively with traditional methods of obtaining such rate information 
our markets are highly competitive we compete for internet advertising revenues with the personal finance sections of general interest sites such as yahoo finance  aol personal finance and msn money  personal finance destination sites such as the motley fool  cbs marketwatch  smartmoney 
com  kiplinger 
com and cnnmoney 
com  e commerce oriented sites that include banking and credit products such as lendingtree and pricegrabber  lead aggregators such as lowermybills  ihomeowners and nextag  print mortgage table sellers like mmis and national financial news service  rate listing sites such as monstermoving  realtor 
com  informa research services  checkinterestrates 
com carsdirect  and interest 
com  and key word cost per click advertising sites networks such as google  overture  ask jeeves and findwhat 
in addition  new competitors may easily enter this market as there are few barriers to entry 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
many competitors have complementary products or services that drive traffic to their web sites 
increased competition could result in lower web site traffic  advertising rate reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which would adversely affect our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
our web site may encounter technical problems and service interruptions in the past  our web site has experienced significant increases in traffic in response to interest rate movements and other business or financial news events 
the number of our users has continued to increase over time  and we are seeking to further increase our user base 
as a result  our internet servers must accommodate spikes in demand for our web pages in addition to potential significant growth in traffic 
our web site has in the past  and may in the future  experience slower response times or interruptions as a result of increased traffic or other reasons 
these delays and interruptions resulting from failure to maintain internet service connections to our site could frustrate users and reduce our future web site traffic  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
all of our communications and network equipment is co located at our corporate headquarters in north palm beach  florida and at a secure third party co location facility in atlanta  georgia 
multiple system failures at these locations could lead to interruptions or delays in service for our web site  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our systems against damage from fires  hurricanes  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunications failures  break ins  computer viruses  hacker attacks and other events beyond our control 
although we maintain business interruption insurance  it may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to failures of our systems 
we rely on the protection of our intellectual property our intellectual property consists of the content of our web site and print publications 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and our user policy and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our web sites or print publications without authorization 
a failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we license some of our data and content from other parties  we may be exposed to infringement actions if such parties do not possess the necessary proprietary rights 
generally  we obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of licensed content and obtain indemnification to cover any breach of any these representations 
however  these representations may not be accurate and the indemnification may not be sufficient to provide adequate compensation for any breach of these representations 
any future infringement or other claims or prosecutions related to our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
defending against any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to introduce new content or trademarks  develop new technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may face liability for information on our web site much of the information published on our web site relates to the competitiveness of financial institutions rates  products and services 
we may be subjected to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other theories relating to the information we publish on our web sites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against providers of online services as well as print publications 
our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims 
future government regulation of the internet is uncertain and subject to change as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal or state agencies or foreign governments may occur 
such regulation is likely in the areas of user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
additionally  taxation of internet use or electronic commerce transactions may be imposed 
any regulation imposing fees for internet use or electronic commerce transactions could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet commerce  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be limited or restricted in the way we establish and maintain our online relationships by laws generally applicable to our business state and federal lending laws and regulations generally require the accurate disclosure of the critical components of credit costs so that consumers can readily compare credit terms from various lenders 
in addition  these laws and regulations impose certain restrictions on the advertisement of these credit terms 
because we are an aggregator of rate and other information regarding many financial products online  we may be subject to some of these laws and regulations 
we believe that we have structured our web site to comply with these laws and regulations 
however  if these laws and regulations are changed  or if new laws or regulations are enacted  these events could prohibit or substantially alter the content we provide on our web site 
moreover  such events could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to corporate control and our stock price our ownership is heavily concentrated at december   approximately of our outstanding common stock was beneficially owned by our officers and directors  including peter c 
morse  a director and our largest shareholder  who beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  our officers and directors will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring shareholder approval 
in particular  these controlling shareholders will have the ability to elect all of our directors and approve or disapprove significant corporate transactions 
this control could be used to prevent or significantly delay another company or person from acquiring or merging with us and could inhibit our liquidity and affect trading in our common stock 
our success may depend on management and key employees our success may depend largely upon retaining the continued services of our executive officers and other key management  developing personnel as well as hiring and training additional employees 
we have a number of key employees on whom we depend and who may be difficult to replace 
a failure to retain our current key employees or to hire enough qualified employees to sustain our growth could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may encounter difficulties with future acquisitions we may acquire complementary web sites and other content providers as a part of our business strategy 
any acquisitions may present a number of potential risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these risks include the following failure to integrate the technical operations and personnel in a timely and cost effective manner  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired company  and assumption of unexpected material liabilities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates that are available for sale at reasonable prices 
we may finance future acquisitions with debt financing  which would increase our debt service requirements  or through the issuance of additional common or preferred stock  which could result in dilution to our shareholders 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly our results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of several factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include changes in fees paid by advertisers  traffic levels on our web site  which can fluctuate significantly  changes in the demand for internet products and services  changes in fee or revenue sharing arrangements with our distribution partners  our ability to enter into or renew key distribution agreements  the introduction of new internet advertising services by us or our competitors  changes in our capital or operating expenses  general economic conditions  and changes in banking or other laws that could limit or eliminate content on our web site 
our future revenue and results of operations are difficult to forecast due to these factors 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance 
in future periods  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our stock price may be particularly volatile because of the industry we are in the stock prices and trading volume of internet related companies have been extremely volatile 
accordingly  our stock price can be volatile as well 
in january  we announced that our common stock had been removed from the nasdaq national market and had become eligible for trading on the otc bulletin board 
on january   we announced that our common stock had begun trading on the nasdaq smallcap market and on august   we announced that our common stock had again begun trading on the nasdaq national market under our existing stock symbol rate 
if our common stock price drops significantly  we may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could eliminate the trading market for our common stock our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market 
in order to continue to be included on the nasdaq national market  a company must meet certain maintenance criteria 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such criteria 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet these listing criteria 
if our common stock were to be delisted  we would be required to meet the criteria for initial listing if we wanted to be listed on the nasdaq national market again 
the initial listing standards are more stringent than the maintenance standards 
accordingly  we cannot provide assurances that if we were delisted we would be able to have our common stock relisted on the nasdaq national market 
further  if our common stock were to be delisted  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock

in march  american interbanc mortgage  llc ai  a mortgage lender that advertised on bankrate 
com  filed suit in the superior court of california against several of ai s competitors not including bankrate  inc who also advertised on our website for i false advertising under the federal lanham act  ii common law unfair competition  and iii violations of certain sections of the california business and professions code 
in august  we declined to renew ai s advertising contract 
in december  ai filed a first amended complaint the amended complaint  adding us as a defendant  and asserting an additional claim for an alleged violation of the cartwright act  california s antitrust law  alleging that we conspired with all of the co defendants various mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers to allow them to engage in allegedly false advertising on our web site while also precluding ai from advertising on our web site 
the amended complaint sought an undisclosed sum of monetary damages  restitution of profits  compensation acquired as a result of the allegedly wrongful conduct  attorney s fees  costs  and injunctive relief 
we filed a special motion to strike the amended complaint under california s anti slapp strategic lawsuits against public participation statute  contending that i ai s claims against us were all based on publishing decisions protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution and its counterpart in the california constitution  and ii ai could not establish a probability of success on the merits of its claims 
we also filed a demurrer to the amended complaint  contending that it failed to state facts constituting a valid cause of action against us 
ai filed motions i for a preliminary injunction against us  seeking an order requiring us to publish ai s advertisements and to cease publishing the alleged false advertisements of ai s competitors  and ii seeking sanctions against us for having filed an allegedly frivolous anti slapp motion 
by orders dated april  and may   the trial court i denied our anti slapp motion  ii granted our demurrer as to ai s common law unfair competition claim  but otherwise overruled the demurrer  iii denied ai s motion for a preliminary injunction  and iv denied ai s motion for sanctions 
on may   we appealed the order denying our anti slapp claim  and ai  among other things  appealed the order denying ai s motion for preliminary injunction 
the court of appeal of the state of california  fourth appellate district  affirmed the various appeals and denied all relief requested 
on january   ai filed its second amended complaint asserting five counts  including claims for i false advertising under the lanham act  against all defendants  ii restraint of trade under the cartwright act  against all defendants  iii intentional interference with economic relations  against defendants other than us  iv intentional interference with prospective economic advantage  against some defendants including us  and v false advertising and unfair trade practices  against all defendants 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages  including treble damages  interest  attorney s fees  and costs  disgorgement of property and profits allegedly wrongfully acquired  restitution  an accounting  and injunctive relief 
on december   we received a statement of damages the statement by which ai  for the first time  has indicated the amount of damages it allegedly seeks 
in the statement the ai states  without factual explanation  that it is informed and believes that its damages are not less than million  allegedly incurred as a proximate result of 
all 
defendants wrongful conduct 
ai seeks to have those damages trebled and also seeks reasonable attorney s fees pursuant to usc section b and california business and professions code section a  and costs 
in connection with the causes of action for intentional interference with economic relations and prospective economic advantage  ai in its statement reserves the right to seek not less than million in punitive damages when it seeks a judgment in the action 
we believe that all of ai s claims against it are factually and legally without merit 
we will continue vigorously to defend ourself against all ai s claims  and will continue to seek redress through all applicable remedies for any injuries suffered by us in connection with this matter 
at december   the outcome of this matter was uncertain 
we cannot estimate at this time  the amount of loss  if any  that could result from an adverse resolution of this litigation

we base our judgments  estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we evaluate our judgments  estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the judgments  estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting for income taxes  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
below we discuss the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our judgments  estimates and assumptions relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see the discussion in the section titled results of operations and critical accounting policies below  and note of our notes to financial statements 
income taxes as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
up to the third quarter of  we had provided a full valuation allowance against accumulated deferred tax assets  reflecting the uncertainty associated with our future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of management reassessed the valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets 
factors considered included historical results of operations  volatility of the economic and interest rate environment and projected earnings based on current operations 
based on this evidence  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released  of the valuation allowance  which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately  during the quarters ended march  june  and september   we continued to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we completed our business planning process during the fourth quarter of  which included the following strategic initiatives for the enhancement of our quality control process and procedures  the re design of our web site  the execution of exclusive advertising contracts with two mortgage lead aggregators  broadening the breadth and depth of our products and services  a reorganization of our advertising sales force  and the migration to a cost per click revenue model on our rate tables 
considering these strategic initiatives and their impact on future earnings potential  as well as our recent profitability  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the entire deferred tax asset 
at december   we reversed the remaining  valuation allowance resulting in an income tax benefit of  and a net deferred tax asset of  the realization of the  deferred tax asset depends on our ability to continue to generate taxable income in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or a portion of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged against earnings in the period such determination is made 
approximately  of the valuation allowance was attributable to the tax benefit of stock options exercised in a prior year 
the income tax benefit relating to stock option exercised during was approximately  for a total current year benefit of approximately  which was allocated to stockholders equity 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we look at historical write offs and sales growth when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
our allowance has historically approximated of gross accounts receivable and varies based on the level of accounts receivable at the end of the reporting period 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if the level of accounts receivable increases  the need for possible additional allowances may be necessary 
any additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and included in general and administrative expenses 
legal contingencies we have been and currently are parties to proceedings as disclosed elsewhere in this report 
these proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties which make the estimates of loss  if any  extremely judgmental 
we recognize a loss contingency pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when the estimated loss is probable of occurrence and the amount of the loss is estimable 
in addition  we consider other factors including the nature of the litigation  claim or assessment  the progress on the case  the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors  the experience of the company in similar cases  the experience of other enterprises  and any management decisions regarding how the company intends to respond to the lawsuit  claim or assessment

revenue total revenue year ended december  revenue online publishing print publishing and licensing total revenue online publishing revenue we sell graphical advertisements on our web site including co branded sites consisting of banner  badge  billboard  poster and skyscraper advertisements 
these advertisements are sold to advertisers according to the cost per thousand impressions  or cpm  the advertiser receives 
the amount of advertising we sell is a function of the number of visitors to our web site  the number of ad pages we serve to those visitors  the number of advertisements per page  and the capacity of our sales force 
advertising sales are invoiced monthly at amounts based on specific contract terms 
when the number of impressions over the contract term is guaranteed  the monthly invoiced amount is based on the monthly contractual number of impressions to be delivered at the contractual price  or cpm 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the actual number of impressions delivered  and the revenue corresponding to any under delivery is deferred as unearned income on the balance sheet and is recognized later when the under delivery is served 
when the number of impressions over the contract term is not guaranteed  the monthly invoiced amount is determined and revenue is recognized based on the actual number of impressions delivered at the contractual price or cpm 
additionally  we generate revenue on a per action basis ie  a purchase or completion of an application when a visitor to our web site transacts with one of our advertisers after viewing an advertisement 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the number of actions reported by the advertiser  subject to our verification 
we are also involved in revenue sharing arrangements with our online partners where the consumer uses co branded sites hosted by us 
revenue is effectively allocated to each partner based on the percentage of advertisement views at each site 
the allocated revenue is shared according to distribution agreements 
revenue is recorded at gross amounts and partnership payments are recorded in cost of revenue  pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we also sell hyperlinks interest rate table listings to various third party internet sites that generate a fixed monthly fee  which is recognized in the month earned 
we also sell text links on its rate pages to advertisers on a cost per click cpc basis 
advertisers enter an auction bidding process on a third party web site for placement of their text link based on the amount they are willing to pay for each click though to their web site 
we recognize revenue monthly for each text link based on the number of clicks at the cpc contracted for during the auction bidding process 
online publishing revenue also includes barter revenue  which represents the exchange of advertising space on our web site for reciprocal advertising space or traffic on other web sites 
barter revenues and expenses are recorded at the fair market value of the advertisements delivered or received  whichever is more determinable in the circumstances 
we follow the accounting literature provided by eitf  accounting for advertising barter transactions 
in accordance with eitf  barter transactions have been valued based on similar cash transactions which have occurred within six months prior to the date of the barter transaction 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized as income when advertisements are delivered on our web site 
barter expense is recognized when our advertisements are run on the other companies web sites  which is typically in the same period barter revenue is recognized 
if the advertising impressions are received from the customer prior to our delivering the advertising impressions  a liability is recorded 
if we deliver advertising impressions to the other companies web sites prior to receiving the advertising impressions  a prepaid expense is recorded 
no prepaid expense or liability was recorded at december  and barter revenue was approximately   and  and represented approximately    and of total revenue  respectively  for the years ended december   and online publishing revenue year ended december  yty change yty change graphic ads hyperlinks barter online publishing revenue was   and  in  and  respectively  representing annual growth rates of and for and  respectively 
excluding barter revenue  online publishing revenue was   and  in  and  respectively  representing annual growth rates of and for and  respectively 
graphic advertisement sales were  or  higher in due to higher cpm s  offsetting an million  or  decline in page views compared to we also sold million  or  more ads during compared to during  graphic advertisements were purchased by an average of graphic advertisers monthly compared to in the slower growth in reflects lower post refinance mortgage demand 
during  we sold graphic advertisements to seven mortgage lead aggregators that generated approximately of our graphic advertising revenue while using approximately of our available inventory 
in january   we entered into exclusive agreements with lowermybills  inc and ihomeowners  inc the companies  respectively 
under the terms of the agreements  we will run graphic advertisements from the companies on our home page  mortgage and refinance channels  calculators  and other areas of our web site on a category exclusive basis  at agreed upon cpm s  and utilizing approximately of available inventory 
we may also participate in a performance based revenue sharing opportunity with each of the companies 
the agreements continue until the later of december  or until such time as we deliver the total number of advertising impressions specified in the agreements 
we believe that we will earn more revenue from these agreements than we were able to earn with the seven mortgage lead aggregators 
we also believe that we can sell the inventory that will become available at higher cpm s than we were able to yield from the aggregators 
graphic advertisement sales were  or  higher in than in as approximately million  or  more advertisements were sold in compared to this increase was a direct result of serving approximately million  or  more page views in compared to however  graphic advertisements were sold at approximately lower cpm s as we monetized the increase in page views albeit at lower rates 
graphic advertisement pricing is sensitive to market supply and demand  the interest rate environment and consumer spending patterns 
during  graphic advertisements were purchased by an average of graphic advertisers monthly compared to in hyperlink sales were  or  higher in than in due to higher pricing even though the average number of monthly advertisers dropped by approximately during during  there were approximately advertisers on average each month compared to during hyperlink sales were  or  higher in than in due to a increase in the number of average monthly hyperlink advertisers over during  there were approximately more hyperlink advertisers on average each month than in we also implemented price increases ranging from to that impacted contract renewals 
consumer demand for our mortgage related services heightened during and continued into early due to the declining interest rate environment 
our advertisers increased their spending in efforts to capitalize on this demand during these periods 
a majority of our advertising customers purchase advertising under short term contracts 
customers have the ability to stop  and have on occasion stopped  advertising on relatively short notice 
online publishing revenue would be adversely impacted if we experienced contract terminations  or if we were not able to renew contracts with existing customers or obtain new customers 
the market for internet advertising is intensely competitive and has  in the past  experienced significant downturns in demand that could impact advertising rates 
future revenue could be adversely affected if we were forced to reduce our advertising rates or if we were to experience lower cpm s 
historically  our first calendar quarter had been our highest in terms of page views  and we had typically experienced a slowdown in traffic during our third and fourth quarters 
during  certain traffic initiatives and expanded commitments from our distribution partners as well as the activity in mortgage lending caused increases in traffic inconsistent with our historical trends that continued through the second quarter of as brand awareness continues to strengthen for bankrate 
com  we believe our quarterly page views will become more consistent with a possible decline in the fourth quarter due to the holiday seasons 
page views millions q q q q year print publishing and licensing revenue print publishing and licensing revenue represents advertising revenue from the sale of advertising in consumer mortgage guide rate tables  newsletter subscriptions  and licensing of research information 
we charge a commission for placement of the consumer mortgage guide in a print publication 
advertising revenue and commission income is recognized when the consumer mortgage guide runs in the publication 
revenue from our newsletters is recognized ratably over the period of the subscription  which is generally up to one year 
revenue from the sale of research information is recognized ratably over the contract period 
we also earn fees from distributing editorial rate tables that are published in newspapers and magazines across the united states  from paid subscriptions to three newsletters  and from providing rate surveys to institutions and government agencies

we ended with consumer mortgage guide contracts  the same as in  continuing the lower post refinance consumer demand 
editorial sales were up over reflecting the newspapers continuing efforts to cut costs and reduce their editorial advertising content spending 
print publishing and licensing revenue increased  or  in over  and  or  in over  due primarily to increases in consumer mortgage guide revenue 
these increases resulted from declining interest rates beginning in and continuing through that bolstered the mortgage and refinance markets resulting in more advertisers publishing their rates 
during  we generated revenue from the sale of mortgage rate and product listings in metropolitan newspapers compared to in and in our syndicated editorial content and research revenue declined from to and from to we believe that newspapers are continuously forced to reduce expenses as the internet and other non print media make it easier for consumers to obtain information 
during and  we saw our newspaper customers reduce their spends with us as they became more unwilling to pay for content 
while we are constantly looking for new business  we believe that the branding  marketing and public relations exposure benefits received in serving our existing customer base of major metropolitan newspapers outweigh the loss in revenue

income taxes our effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate  primarily as a result of the changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
up to the third quarter of  we had provided a full valuation allowance against accumulated deferred tax assets  reflecting the uncertainty associated with our future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of management reassessed the valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets 
factors considered included historical results of operations  volatility of the economic and interest rate environment and projected earnings based on current operations 
based on this evidence  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released  of the valuation allowance  which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately  during the quarters ended march  june  and sept   we continued to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we completed our business planning process during the fourth quarter of  which included the following strategic initiatives for the enhancement of our quality control process and procedures  the re design of our web site  the execution of exclusive advertising contracts with two mortgage lead aggregators  broadening the breadth and depth of our products and services  a reorganization of our advertising sales force  and the migration to a cost per click revenue model on our rate tables 
considering these strategic initiatives and their impact on future earnings potential  as well as our recent profitability  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the entire deferred tax asset 
at december   we reversed the remaining  valuation allowance resulting in an income tax benefit of  and a net deferred tax asset of  the realization of the  deferred tax asset depends on our ability to continue to generate taxable income in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or a portion of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged against earnings in the period such determination is made 
approximately  of the valuation allowance was attributable to the tax benefit of stock options exercised in a prior year 
the income tax benefit relating to stock option exercised during was approximately  for a total current year benefit of approximately  which was allocated to stockholders equity

r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to directors and employees  including stock option grants  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
in note above for the pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts for the years ended december   and  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas no 
r to measure compensation expense for director and employee stock option grants 
we are evaluating the requirements under sfas no 
r and expect the adoption to significantly reduce net income and earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment strategy is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from investments without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize this risk  to date we have maintained our portfolio of cash equivalents in short term and overnight investments that are not subject to market risk  as the interest paid on such investments fluctuates with the prevailing interest rates 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents mature in less than three months 
exchange rate sensitivity our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is minimal to none as we do not have any revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have not engaged in any derivative or hedging transactions to date
