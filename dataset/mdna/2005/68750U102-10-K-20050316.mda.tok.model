table of contents our products and product candidates as further discussed below under the caption government regulation  our products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation as medical devices by the fda  regulatory authorities in europe and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions 
in the european union  we have selected tno  or the netherlands organization for applied scientific research  as our notified body our notified body under the medical devices directive 
product approval applications for our products must be supported by valid scientific evidence  and may require clinical trial data  to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the products 
vitoss bone graft substitute vitoss blocks and morsels approved in european union in july fda k cleared december vitoss micro and macro morsels fda k cleared december vitoss standard and micro canisters fda k cleared november vitoss foam product platform  including vitoss foam strips and cylinders fda k cleared december vitoss foam flow fda k cleared december vitoss foam shapes fda k cleared december vitoss bone graft substitute is an ultra porous resorbable beta tricalcium phosphate bone void filler used to help the body guide the three dimensional regeneration of the patient s own bone 
we launched vitoss bone graft substitute in the us and the european union in and have sold over  units to date 
vitoss bone graft substitute s ultra porosity allows it to soak and hold of its own volume in blood and bone marrow aspirate and has been shown to perform well in an array of applications in the spine  extremities and pelvis  such as spinal grafting and the treatment of bone defects due to trauma  degenerative disease and tumors 
vitoss bone graft substitute integrates well into existing bone and promotes new bone in growth and maturation 
since the initial us regulatory clearance and subsequent product launch in mid  we have developed and are developing a number of new vitoss based products and related delivery devices that are designed to expand the market for our vitoss bone graft substitute products by broadening the range of surgical indications and by addressing additional surgeon preferences and needs 
in  we entered into a development  manufacturing and supply agreement with kensey  which has led to the development and initial launch of a new product platform branded under the name vitoss foam 
the vitoss foam products combine our base vitoss bone graft substitute technology with kensey s proprietary resorbable biomaterials to produce a wide array of pliant  flexible  flowable and compression resistant bone graft materials 
the vitoss foam products have the ability to soak and hold of its own volume in blood and bone marrow aspirate while retaining these biological fluids in pliable and compression resistant forms 
these forms can be designed into specific shapes and material characteristics to meet surgeon needs for handling and delivery in a variety of surgical approaches and applications 
bone defect grafting 
injury or trauma to the bone  as well as degenerative conditions  disease and aging  affect the health and viability of the human skeleton 
these conditions often result in the need for the repair of bone defects through a bone grafting procedure 
we estimate that approximately  bone grafting procedures on a worldwide basis are performed each year in the spine  extremities and pelvis 
bone grafting material is either i autograft material  which is often obtained or harvested from the iliac crest region of the patient s own hip  or ii allograft material  which is obtained from a cadaver  or iii synthetically derived materials that provide one or more components of either bone like scaffold such as vitoss bone graft substitute  cells or signals such as bone morphogenic proteins 
vitoss bone graft substitute has been used in bone grafting procedures as a bone graft substitute to provide a synthetic scaffold in a variety of applications  including those of the long bone  extremity  spine and pelvic areas 
a harvest of autograft material involves an additional procedure that extends surgical time  adding to costs and increasing blood loss and patient risk of infection or adverse reaction from the additional time under anesthesia 
in addition  harvesting bone for autograft sometimes causes protracted pain that may necessitate additional medical care after the surgical procedure 
using vitoss bone graft substitute instead of autograft material may avoid these potential complications 
spinal grafting 
many patients affected by severe back pain due to degeneration of one or more discs are treated with a spinal surgical procedure 
we estimate that each year approximately  spinal surgical procedures are done on a worldwide basis 
in cases where the patient has advanced disc degeneration or spinal instability  a spinal surgical procedure may involve a surgical incision in the patient s back or abdomen and frequently requires the removal of the affected disc material and the surgical attachment of a metal implant  spinal fusion cage  or machined bone derived from a cadaver to provide the initial support and intrinsic stability of the bony structure for the two surrounding vertebrae 
such spinal surgical procedures may require the use of a bone grafting material to help treat any surgically created bony defects 
we believe the use of vitoss bone graft substitute  rather than allograft or autograft materials  in spinal grafting procedures is preferable for both the patient and the surgeon 
iliac crest repair 
the bone grafting material used to pack certain implants and cages used in spinal fusion procedure is often autograft material  obtained or harvested from the iliac crest region of the patient s own hip through an operating procedure 
this procedure leaves an open space in the iliac crest  which is often painful and slow healing 
we estimate that each year  autograft material is used in approximately  spinal fusion procedures worldwide and that harvested material is used in another  non spinal fusion related procedures worldwide 
vitoss bone graft substitute can be used to repair the bone void left by the harvest procedure at the time of surgery and may reduce the incidence of post operative bleeding and post operative pain at the harvest site and speed healing time 
in post marketing studies of vitoss bone graft substitute for iliac crest repair  initial results indicated the use of vitoss bone graft substitute performs well in the formation of new bone 
trauma 
physical trauma such as falls and accidents can result in bone fracture or damage 
fractures of broken bones are often realigned with hardware  such as plates  rods and screws 
once the hardware has been used to recreate the skeletal anatomy and to provide the stability of the bony structure  there are often defects or voids in the bone which remain 
those voids may require the use of bone graft material 
the goal of bone grafting in trauma applications is to rapidly heal the damaged bone 
approximately  trauma related bone graft repairs are performed annually on a worldwide basis 
autograft  cadaver allograft  as well as synthetic scaffolds  like vitoss bone graft substitute  are used for trauma related bone graft repairs 
vitoss bone graft substitute has been used as a bone graft substitute in a variety of trauma applications  including those of the long bone  extremity  and pelvis  as well as to fill bone void defects due to trauma in fractures of the wrist  ankle  tibia and femur 

table of contents dental  periodontal  oral and cranio maxillofacial 
in august  we entered into a supply agreement with biomimetic that allows biomimetic to use its rhpdgf in combination with our proprietary vitomatrix particulate synthetic scaffold biomaterial  which we produce in the same process used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute 
under the agreement  we will supply our proprietary calcium phosphate biomaterial to biomimetic for its clinical and commercial use in conjunction with rhpdgf  which is currently distributed for investigational use 
the agreement provides that  upon obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals  biomimetic will market and sell the combined product in the dental  periodontal  oral and cranio maxillofacial bone grafting markets 
imbibe bone marrow aspirate and delivery devices  used with vitoss bone graft substitute bone marrow aspirate syringe fda k cleared september disposable delivery funnel class i device see government regulation below disposable delivery tube class i device see government regulation below the disposable imbibe devices provide spine and orthopedic surgeons with a simple method for harvesting a patient s own bone marrow  mixing it with vitoss bone graft substitute  and delivering the mixture to the bone graft site 
we believe imbibe  when used together with vitoss bone graft substitute  will provide greater flexibility and options for surgeons 
imbibe is covered by a us issued patent 
vitagel surgical hemostat vitagel surgical hemostat  includes vitagel previously named costasis pma approved  us distribution rights obtained june see government regulation below cellpaker pma approved  us distribution rights obtained june see government regulation below mea pma approved  us distribution rights obtained june see government regulation below lea pma approved  us distribution rights obtained june see government regulation below vitagel is an fda approved  composite liquid hemostat that combines the biomaterials thrombin and collagen with the patient s autologous plasma 
when applied to the surgical site  vitagel creates a safe adherent matrix and an impermeable barrier to blood flow 
vitagel has been marketed to general surgeons and is applicable in the spine  hip and knee replacement surgery markets  where bleeding is a significant complication for many routine surgeries 
our agreement with angiotech also includes options for us to distribute vitagel at a future date in europe and the rest of the world 
in january  we rebranded costasis as vitagel surgical hemostat with cellpaker accessories  and relaunched the product within our existing orthopedics and spine based distribution channel  utilizing the same marketing strategy that we use for all of our vitoss related products 
we believe this strategy will provide our sales network additional functional biomaterial products to offer to their customers 
near term product development we have developed and are continuing to develop new products under our approved vitoss bone graft substitute and vitagel surgical hemostat product platforms 
we will further expand our vitoss bone graft substitute product portfolio during the second half of  including the anticipated launch of vitoss foam pack for impaction grafting used in hip and knee revision procedures 
we are seeking to bring any product line extensions to market in the us through the k regulatory process see government regulation below 
these product line extensions will be in addition to our long term us cortoss investigational device exemption ide clinical program  which is described below 
endoskeleton ta devices we are developing our endoskeleton technology platform 
in the first quarter of  we received k regulatory clearance for endoskeleton ta vertebral body replacement structural device  which provides physiological support to  or replaces damaged vertebral bodies and commenced limited sales during the second quarter of we plan to further develop our endoskeleton technology platform to be used in conjunction with our bone graft substitute materials  such as our vitoss foam products 
we intend to evolve our endoskeleton product program over the next several years into an array of products with regenerative scaffolds for the extremities  long bones and spine 
we believe this configuration of the endoskeleton product platform will expand our reach into new markets and new clinical indications 
cortoss synthetic cortical bone cortoss synthetic cortical bone is a high strength  self setting composite engineered specifically to mimic the characteristics of human cortical bone 
laboratory tests demonstrate that cortoss exhibits compressive strength similar to human cortical bone and is bioactive such that it promotes bone growth 
for patients with poor bone healing  as seen in osteoporotic patients  cortoss may be used in a variety of surgical procedures to quickly provide structural stability and reinforcement of the bones after surgery 
the surgeon s goal is to repair the patient s bone and provide mobility to the patient as quickly as possible since prolonged bed rest or inactivity often results in decreased overall health for osteoporotic patients 
cortoss synthetic cortical bone s simple mix on demand delivery system design allows for minimum waste and maximum ease of use and flexibility for the surgeon 
cortoss is an injectable material that is delivered aseptically through a pre filled  unit dose  disposable cartridge 
delivery of cortoss to the surgical site may be started and stopped for a prolonged period of time throughout the surgical procedure as polymerization is initiated when cortoss is expressed through its static mix tip 
the polymerization is a self setting reaction that causes cortoss to harden within minutes 
cortoss provides two stages of fixation immediate mechanical interlock into porous bone  followed by intimate bone growth over time along the contours of its surface 
cortoss is covered by several us issued patents and other us and foreign patent applications are pending 
we received the ce certification for cortoss synthetic cortical bone for use in screw augmentation procedures in october in the european union and regulatory approval in march in australia  which enables us to sell cortoss in these territories as well as in other countries that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
screw augmentation is a procedure for securing the fixation of bone screws used in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis 
we initiated a limited launch of cortoss in europe in december we successfully completed post marketing human clinical studies in europe for the use of cortoss in hip compression screw augmentation 
in addition  during january  we received ce certification in the european union to market cortoss for vertebral augmentation of vertebral compression fractures vcfs of the spine 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs is a procedure for repairing fractured vertebrae that can be performed on an outpatient or short stay basis 
during and  we completed patient enrollment of two fda approved ide pilot clinical studies in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty surgical techniques  respectively 
both surgical techniques involve the injection of a self setting material into the vertebral body to provide internal fixation of the vcf 
upon fda review of the vertebroplasty pilot clinical data  we received approval from fda to begin patient enrollment of the pivotal phase of that clinical study 
the study design was subsequently amended and approved by fda in august the amended study design now compares cortoss to a treatment arm using polymethylmethacrylate pmma bone cement instead of a non treatment 
table of contents arm consisting of conservative care and pain management 
in october  we commenced the amended study and we expect costs associated with patient enrollment for this pivotal study to increase in we do not expect to receive fda approval for the sale of cortoss in the us for the next several years  if at all 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
we estimate there are approximately  patients worldwide with vcfs caused by osteoporotic bone or bone cancer resulting in severe pain and immobility 
of these  we believe approximately  fractures are diagnosed 
the traditional treatments  eg  bed rest  bracing  narcotics or anesthetic injections  do not address the underlying fracture 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs has been reported to provide early pain relief in over of osteoporotic patients 
early relief of pain provided by vertebral augmentation of vcfs enables patients to maintain better functional capacity 
functional capacity  in turn  is believed to be directly related to the ability to live independently and unassisted 
we are not aware of any product that has received fda approval or ce certification for use in this procedure on the basis of prospective  controlled clinical data 
however  during several versions of pmma bone cement have been k cleared by the fda 
we believe cortoss may have several advantages over pmma in vertebral augmentation of vcfs  such as its lower temperature setting that reduces the risk of tissue necrosis associated with pmma  its higher compression strength and more natural elasticity and its ability to be mixed on demand 
in addition  cortoss does not release free unreacted monomers  which are very volatile  into the patient s body like pmma 
published data reports that monomer release have been shown to cause a variety of cardiopulmonary complications such as hypotension and emboli in the lungs and brain 
screw augmentation 
worldwide each year  we estimate approximately  orthopedic procedures are performed using internal fixation devices that involve screws 
we believe about  of these involve long bone fractures that are treated with metal plates and screws and the remainder of these procedures involve hip fractures treated with compression screws and spinal fractures treated with pedicle screws 
cortoss may be used in those procedures where the screws strip or fail to hold the integrity of the internal fixation construct due to poor bone quality  as is often the case with osteoporotic bone 
long bone screw augmentation 
in long bone fractures  screws are placed into the plate and serve to compress the fracture  permitting faster healing 
we estimate these screws strip or fail to hold in approximately  osteoporotic patients each year due to poor bone quality  as is often the case in osteoporotic bone 
where screws fail to hold  current treatment options include i replacement of the screw with a screw of larger diameter  which may further weaken the bone and is not always possible because of the size of the screw holes and or the bone  ii replacing the plate with a longer plate with more screw holes to span the failed screw holes  which adds considerable time to the procedure  creates a larger wound area  increases the risk of other screws failing due to their removal and reimplantation  and in certain situations is anatomically not possible  iii leaving the plate with the failed screws as it is and giving the patient a non load bearing cast for a prolonged period of time  which increases the risk of post operative complications related to immobilization  such as deep venous thrombosis  or iv augmenting the screws with pmma bone cement  which is cumbersome and time consuming because it needs to be manually mixed and transferred into a syringe for application and  after mixing there only is a small time window in which it can be used before it sets  making it difficult to augment more than one screw at a time 
additionally  pmma bone cement is not approved in either europe or the us for this indication 
the use of cortoss synthetic cortical bone to anchor the screw in a quick and efficient way will enable the full function of the screw to be restored 
we are not aware of any cement products that have received fda approval or ce certification that would be in competition with cortoss for this indication 
a patient multi center clinical study in europe of patients undergoing surgery to repair bone fractures demonstrated that cortoss synthetic cortical bone enabled the successful use of metal screws in the repair procedures despite patients poor bone quality 
the three month study showed cortoss restored the holding power of percent of previously failed bone screws  permitting the use of a plate to stabilize the fracture and healing in all patients with no adverse events related to cortoss reported 
pedicle screw augmentation 
many spinal surgeries today have become possible only due to the availability of instrumentation systems that allow manipulation and fixation of the individual elements of the spine 
these instrumentation systems are attached to the spine by means of screws placed in the pedicle region of the vertebrae 
in patients with sub optimal bone quality  such as osteoporotic patients  the purchase or bite of these screws may be insufficient to maintain the integrity of the construction 
we estimate there are approximately  patients who have pedicle screws implanted each year on a worldwide basis 
we believe approximately  may require the augmentation of screws due to osteoporosis 
we believe cortoss synthetic cortical bone has the potential to ensure secure fixation of the screws  enabling the instrumentation systems to restore maximum possible fixation and stabilization of the spine 
additionally  we believe cortoss s mix on demand delivery system makes its use here convenient and practical 
we are not aware of any products approved for this indication that would be in competition with cortoss 
compression screw augmentation 
we estimate approximately  hip fractures occur annually worldwide of which an estimated  are repaired using compression screw augmentation 
many osteoporotic patients  particularly elderly women  suffer a fracture of the hip whereby the ball of the hip and socket  or the head of the femur leg bone  is separated from the rest of the bone 
these fractures are often treated through the use of compression hip screws  which are placed through the femur bone and into the femoral head to stabilize and compress the fracture to permit healing 
the healing of a fracture is directly proportional to the degree of stabilization 
the failure of screws to hold is common  especially in osteoporotic bone 
additionally in many cases  even after the screw gains initial hold  once the patient becomes mobile  the screw s sharp thread edges may cause the screw to cut through the bone and walk out through the femoral head 
such a failure during or after the surgical procedure will result in the need for an artificial hip implant 
we believe the use of cortoss synthetic cortical bone to anchor the screw in a quick and efficient way will enable the full function of the screw to be restored 
we are not aware of any products approved for this indication that would be in competition with cortoss 
in two separate clinical studies in europe  cortoss synthetic cortical bone was used to increase the holding power of screws in the bone and to protect the bone from the screw s sharp threads 
the first study included patients with subtrochanteric fractures  which had been treated with dynamic hip screws  and was completed during early none of the augmented screws showed movement and the holding power of the screw was shown to increase significantly in all patients 
this holding power was evidenced by an increase in torque resistance 
a second clinical study was completed  which included patients with intra capsular fractures of the hip  and evaluated the effect of cortoss for the augmentation of two parallel screws used to reduce and fix the hip fracture 
we believe the use of cortoss for this indication has the potential to reduce the need for a second corrective surgery 
aliquot micro delivery system our aliquot micro delivery system facilitates effective delivery of our cortoss synthetic cortical bone product directly to the surgical site 
a two part system of catheter and syringe dispenser is designed to assure effective delivery of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and screw augmentation procedures 
during the second quarter of  we received ce certification from our notified body for aliquot 
the aliquot system was used as part of our european multi center prospective clinical study for cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and is being used in the us clinical studies for cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
aliquot is covered by us issued patents 
significant contractual obligations see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in this report for a discussion of significant contractual arrangements relating to i our joint product development and commercialization  ii our distribution arrangement and iii our revenue sharing arrangement 

table of contents our research development we employ composite engineering  polymer science  solution chemistry and nanoparticulate ceramic glass science to create our biomaterials technology platforms 
we then utilize biomaterials  those developed on our own and jointly with kensey  to develop  synthetic  biologically active products engineered to restore the human skeleton 
patents have been issued and additional patent applications have been filed to protect our key biomaterial developments 
see patents and proprietary intellectual property below for additional information 
we incurred approximately   and  in research and development expenses in  and  respectively 
patents and proprietary intellectual property our strategy is to seek protection for our product technologies and manufacturing methods through the use of us and foreign patents 
we have filed or intend to file applications as appropriate for patents covering our technologies  products and processes 
as of the date of this filing  the products we have developed and marketed are covered by one or more of our thirteen issued us patents  fifteen pending us patent applications and numerous counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications outside the us  including canada  europe  mexico and japan 
vitoss bone graft substitute and vitoss foam family products may be covered by one or more of the following us patent no

manufacturing and product supply the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations  quality system regulation qsr  requirements  international organization for standardization iso series standards and equivalent requirements 
our  square foot vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss manufacturing facilities which produce our commercial products  are leased through july and are certified as meeting the requirements of iso for the period march  through march   and european norm en for the period july  through july  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
the most recent fda inspection resulted with no corrective actions being required 
in addition to the need for cortoss us regulatory approval  in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  the cortoss manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must pass inspection by the fda 
we believe our manufacturing facility has the capacity to meet our commercial needs for the next several years 
we are manufacturing vitagel  imbibe  endoskeleton ta  and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss bone graft substitute is converted to vitoss foam by kensey  our development partner 
our third party manufacturers are iso certified or otherwise meet our quality system requirements see government regulation below 
angiotech will cease to manufacture vitagel on september   therefore  we have begun the process to assume full responsibility for oversight and management for the manufacture of such products by early we believe angiotech will manufacture enough vitagel to supply our customers until our facility is operational in our ability to manufacture our products is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
we do not have any long term supply agreements for raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp  which is described below in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue interests 
sales and marketing in june  we began to assemble a us field sales network of direct sales representatives and independent sales agencies in order to market vitoss bone graft substitute and imbibe bone marrow aspirate and delivery device 
we may further strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are under served 
we also utilize our current field sales network to market vitagel in the us outside of the us  we primarily utilize a network of independent  stocking distributors to market vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss  and aliquot micro delivery system 
competition extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopedic market 
we face intense competition from medical device  biomedical technology  and medical products companies 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may also be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals  or patent protection  for new products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize new competing products in advance of our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe vitoss bone graft substitute faces competition from numerous synthetic and cadaver based products currently on the market as well as other products and technologies that may enter the market in the future 
during  synthetic recombinant signaling growth factors  also known as bone morphogenic proteins bmps  were introduced into the synthetic bone graft marketplace 
bmps are growth factors that are believed to significantly accelerate the healing mechanism of bone 
we believe the healing mechanism of bone is dependent upon the presence of all three of the following components i signaling molecules  either provided by the patient or commercially provided such as with bmps  ii the patient s own stem cells or osteoprogenitor cells  and iii scaffold or bone graft material  either provided by the patient or commercially provided  such as by vitoss bone graft substitute 
we expect the introduction of bmps to expand the overall bone graft market and in particular the synthetic segment of the bone graft market 
we believe that several factors mitigate against the broad use of bmps  including i concern over bmps causing excess bone growth in unwanted areas  and ii the current high cost of bmps in comparison to commercial bone graft materials and to vitoss bone graft substitute in particular 
moreover  due to the high cost of bmps and the potential to cause excessive bone growth  surgeons may prefer using only a small volume of bmps in relation to the anatomic site where new bone growth is sought 
additionally  now that bmps have been on the market for almost two years  it is generally believed that better carriers or scaffolds must be developed to expand clinical usage and utility of bmps 
in  total disk replacement devices tdr s were introduced in the spinal bone grafting market as a treatment alternative for degenerative disk disease designed to preserve the motion of the vertebrae of the spine 
we believe that several factors mitigate against the broad use of tdr s  including the need for surgeon training  the high level of surgeon technical skills required  surgeon concern regarding the challenges of tdr revision surgery should that become necessary due to loosening or subsidence of the device over time  and procedure reimbursement 
it is too early to estimate the rate at which the market will adopt this technology as a treatment alternative or its resulting impact on our products 
vitagel is approved by the fda as a surgical hemostat where bleeding may be a significant complication for many routine surgeries 
as such  vitagel can be 
table of contents marketed broadly to general surgeons and is applicable in the spine  hip and knee replacement surgery markets 
vitagel will face competition from several more established surgical hemostat products marketed by other companies with substantially greater resources than us 
however  we believe vitagel offers unique advantages in comparison to these other products in terms of vitagel s quick and easy preparation for use  as well as its use of the patient s autologous plasma  instead of pooled donated human plasma as is the case with the leading products in the market 
cortoss is under clinical development in the us for use in the vertebral augmentation of vcfs and has received a ce certification for use in the vertebral augmentation of vcfs and in screw augmentation 
if cortoss is approved by the fda for use in the vertebral augmentation of vcfs  it will face competition from the several pmma bone cement products that have been k cleared by the fda for this indication 
outside the us  cortoss is facing competition from several other pmma bone cement products that have received ce certification in for this indication 
we do not know of any products that have received fda approval or a ce certification for use in screw augmentation or for which such approval is being sought 
government regulation in order to market our products  we must apply for  be granted and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals and comply with all regulatory requirements in each applicable jurisdiction 
to date  we have received k regulatory clearance  as described below  for vitoss bone graft substitute in the us from the fda in december and the ce certification in the european union from our notified body in july in march  we also received regulatory approval to sell vitoss bone graft substitute in australia  and in june  we received regulatory approval to sell vitoss bone graft substitute in canada 
the ce certification permits us to sell our approved products in all of the countries of the european union as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
we received k regulatory clearance for vitoss canisters and vitoss foam in november and december  respectively  in the us from the fda 
in september  we received k regulatory clearance in the us from the fda to market our imbibe product for use as a bone marrow aspiration syringe 
we received ce certification for cortoss in october in the european union and regulatory approval in march in australia  which enables us to sell cortoss in these territories for use in securing the fixation of bone screws in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis 
in addition  during january our ce certification was extended to enable us to market cortoss in the european union for vertebral augmentation of vcfs  including compression fractures of the spine caused by osteoporosis and invasive tumors 
during the second quarter of  we received ce certification from our notified body for aliquot 
during and  we completed patient enrollment of two investigational device exemption ide pilot clinical studies in the us for the use of cortoss synthetic cortical bone in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty surgical techniques  respectively 
upon fda review of the vertebroplasty pilot clinical data  we received approval from fda to begin patient enrollment of the pivotal phase of that clinical study 
the study design was subsequently amended in august the amended study design now compares cortoss to a treatment arm using polymethylmethacrylate bone cement instead of a non operative arm consisting of conservative care and pain management under the previous design 
in october  we commenced the amended study and we expect costs associated with patient enrollment for this pivotal study to increase in we do not expect to receive premarket clearance for the sale of cortoss in the us for the next several years  if at all see manufacturing and product supply above 
in december  we received k regulatory clearance for our endoskeleton ta product platform in the us from the fda 
the following discussion summarizes the regulatory requirements applicable to our products 
united states the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act ffd c act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals clearances and criminal prosecution 
in the us  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  ii or iii on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness 
under fda regulations  class i devices  the least regulated category  are subject to general controls and class ii devices are subject to general and special controls 
generally  class iii devices are those that must receive premarket approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness 
before we can introduce a new device into the market  we must generally obtain market clearance through a k notification or premarket approval through a premarket approval application pma 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device  or to a class iii medical device for which the fda has not required a pma 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a request for additional data may require that clinical studies be performed to establish the device s substantial equivalence 
commercial distribution of a device for which a k notification is required can begin only after the fda issues a letter finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device 
pursuant to the ffd c act  the fda must make a determination with respect to a k submission within days of its receipt 
the fda may  and often does  extend this time frame by requesting additional data or information 
a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could delay or prevent the market introduction of new products for which we file such notifications 
for any of our products that are cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new k submissions 
the fda has implemented a policy under which certain device modifications may be submitted as a special k  which will require only a day review 
special k s are limited to those device modifications that do not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device and for which substantial equivalence can be demonstrated through design controls 
we must file a pma if our proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii preamendment device on the market since prior to may  for which fda has called for pmas 
a pma must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive data  including pre clinical and clinical trial data  to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device  as well as extensive manufacturing information 
fda review of a pma generally takes one to two years from the date the pma is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended should the fda ask for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
during the pma review period  an advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  will likely be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to whether the device should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory panel 
toward the end of the pma review process  the fda generally will conduct an inspection of the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with quality system regulation qsr requirements 
if the fda s evaluations of both the pma and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which 
table of contents usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pma 
when  and if  those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda  the agency will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
if the fda s evaluation of the pma or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the pma or issue a not approvable letter 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case pma approval may be delayed up to several years while we conduct additional clinical trials and submit an amendment to the pma 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which other companies have sought fda approval have never been approved for marketing 
modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma including modifications to its labeling or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda of pma supplements or new pmas 
supplements to a pma often require the submission of the same type of information required for an initial pma  except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original pma 
if clinical trials of a device are required in connection with either a k notification or a pma and the device presents a significant risk  we will be required to file an ide application prior to commencing clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is reviewed and approved by the fda and one or more appropriate institutional review boards irbs  clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
if the device presents a non significant risk to the patient  we may begin the clinical trials after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate irbs  but not the fda 
for significant risk devices  we must submit an ide supplement to the fda and receive approval from the fda before we  or our investigator  may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights  safety or welfare of human subjects 
irb approval may be required for changes in the investigational plan for both non significant risk and significant risk devices 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including reporting and record keeping requirements 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the most recent fda inspection resulted with no corrective actions being required 
the ffd c act requires devices to be manufactured in accordance with quality system regulation requirements that impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
medical devices are also subject to post market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury  and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of any approved or cleared product 
our labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved or uncleared uses 
we  as well as our products  are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed 
any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant the pre market clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals  clearances and criminal prosecution 
europe in order to sell our products within the european union  we are required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the european union medical devices directive the mdd and affix a ce mark on our products to attest such compliance 
to achieve this  our products must meet the essential requirements defined under the mdd relating to safety and performance and we must successfully undergo a verification of our regulatory compliance conformity assessment by an independent notified body 
we have selected tno  the netherlands organization for applied science research  as our notified body 
the nature of the conformity assessment will depend on the regulatory class of our products 
under european law  our products  other than imbibe and aliquot which are class i sterile and class ii a  respectively  are likely to be in class iii 
in the case of class iii products  we must as a result of the regulatory structure which we have elected to follow establish and maintain a complete quality system for design and manufacture as described in annex ii of the mdd and demonstrated by compliance with the iso and en standards for 
we are certified as meeting the requirements of iso for the period march  through march   and en for the period july  through july  our notified body has audited our quality system and determined that it meets the requirements of the mdd 
in addition  the notified body must approve the specific design of each device in class iii and iia 
as part of the design approval process  the notified body must also verify that the products comply with the essential requirements of the mdd 
in order to comply with these requirements  we must  among other things  complete a risk analysis and may be required to present clinical data 
the clinical data presented by us must provide evidence that the products meet the performance specifications claimed by us  provide sufficient evidence of adequate assessment of unwanted side effects and demonstrate that the benefits to the patient outweigh the risks associated with the device 
we are subject to continued surveillance by the notified body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities 
we also will be required to comply with additional national requirements that are beyond the scope of the mdd 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
third party reimbursement successful sales of our products in the us and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payers relative to our products 
in the us  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians that purchase or utilize our products for treatment of their patients  generally rely on independent third party payers  such as private insurance companies or hmos  and governmental payers  such as medicare and medicaid to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the provision of items and services using our products 
physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these payers for the cost of procedures using our products 
each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product 
private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations 
therefore  achieving favorable medicare coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product 
medicare is a federally funded program managed by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers  that administers coverage and reimbursement for certain health care items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled 
medicaid is an insurance program for the poor that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state 
the federal government sets general guidelines for medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern their individual program 
medicare provides  among other things  health care benefits that cover  within prescribed limits  the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals  subject to certain deductibles and co payments 
the medicare program has established  and continues to establish  standards and guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain procedures  equipment  supplies and other items and services 
generally  in order to be covered and reimbursed by medicare  a health care item or service furnished to a medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part 
the methodology for determining the coverage status of our products  and the amount of medicare reimbursement for our products  varies based upon  among other factors  the setting in which a medicare beneficiary received health care items and services 
acute care hospitals are generally reimbursed by medicare for 
table of contents inpatient operating costs based upon prospectively determined rates 
under the prospective payment system pps  acute care hospitals receive a predetermined payment rate based upon the diagnosis related group  or drg  into which each medicare beneficiary stay is assigned  regardless of the actual cost of the services provided 
certain additional or outlier payments may be made to a hospital for cases involving unusually high costs 
accordingly  acute care hospitals generally do not receive direct medicare reimbursement under pps for the distinct costs incurred in purchasing the company s products 
rather  reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the drg based payments made to hospitals for the services furnished to medicare eligible inpatients in which our products are utilized 
because pps payments are based on predetermined rates and are often less than a hospital s actual costs in furnishing care  acute care hospitals have incentives to lower their inpatient operating costs by utilizing equipment  devices and supplies  including those sold by us  that will reduce the length of inpatient stays  decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs 
our product revenue could be affected negatively if acute care hospitals discontinue product use due to insufficient reimbursement  or if other treatment options are perceived to be more cost effective 
medicare also reimburses most outpatient services based on a prospective or predetermined fee schedule basis  subject to certain exceptions and limitations 
similarly  some states reimburse certain health care providers for inpatient services under their medicaid programs by using prospective rates for diagnosis related groups of illnesses 
therefore  health care providers may refuse to use our products if coverage or reimbursement is inadequate 
also  any changes in federal legislation  regulations and policy affecting medicare coverage and reimbursement relative to our products could have a material effect on our results of operations 
inadequate coverage or reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products profitably 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain favorable coverage or reimbursement from third party payers or changes in governmental and private third party payers policies toward coverage or reimbursement for procedures employing our products could reduce demand for our products 
member countries of the european union operate various combinations of centrally financed health care systems and private health insurance systems 
the relative importance of government and private systems varies from country to country 
the choice of devices is subject to constraints imposed by the availability of funds within the purchasing institution 
medical devices are most commonly sold to hospitals or health care facilities at a price set by negotiation between the buyer and the seller 
a contract to purchase products may result from an individual initiative or as a result of a competitive bidding process 
in either case  the purchaser pays the supplier  and payment terms vary widely throughout the european union 
failure to obtain favorable negotiated prices with hospitals or health care facilities could adversely affect sales of our products 
product liability and insurance we manufacture medical devices used on patients in surgery  and we may be subject to product liability lawsuits 
we have experienced one product liability claim to date  which we believe is without merit and intend to defend vigorously 
however  there can be no assurance that other product liability claims will not be asserted against us 
under certain of our agreements with our independent sales agencies and stocking distributors  we provide indemnification from product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
we maintain product liability insurance in the annual aggregate amount of up to  although our insurance policies have various exclusions 
thus  we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  with employees at our malvern  pennsylvania headquarters  employees throughout the us and employees in europe 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item properties our headquarters are located at the great valley corporate center in malvern  pennsylvania  which is a suburb of philadelphia 
our manufacturing  research and development and administrative offices utilize approximately  square feet  which is leased through july in addition  approximately  square feet of warehouse space are leased through september we believe our manufacturing facility has the capacity to meet our commercial needs for at least the next several years 
we also have our international sales and marketing activities based in leased administrative office space in leuven  belgium through may item legal proceedings the company is not party to any material legal proceedings  however  we have experienced one product liability claim to date  which we believe is without merit and intend to defend vigorously

this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable and inventories 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed with the audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is not recognized until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in the us  product sales revenue is recognized upon either receipt of documentation from the customer indicating their consumption of product from consigned inventory or shipment of purchased product to the customer 
outside the us  revenue from product sales is primarily recognized upon receipt of our product by our independent stocking distributors 
we do not allow product returns or exchanges 
we have no post shipment obligations to our customers 
both our us customers and our independent stocking distributor customers outside of the us are generally required to pay on a net day basis and sales discounts are not offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s failure to pay for product purchased 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first in first out basis  or fifo 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
for the years ended december  and  inventories include a provision of  and  respectively  to write down inventory to its net realizable value prior to the expiry date of such inventory 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  the costs of producing inventory in the reporting periods prior to the receipt of regulatory approval or clearance are recorded as research and development expense 
revenue interest obligation during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp paul royalty 
the net proceeds from the financing were first allocated to the fair value of the common stock on the date of the transaction which was  and the  remainder of the net proceeds was allocated to the revenue interest obligation in accordance with emerging issues task force issues no 
 sales of future revenues eitf 
on march   we amended the original financing  which resulted in a one time increase to the revenue interest obligation of  increasing the balance of the revenue interest obligation to  as of december  and the majority of products that are subject to the revenue interest have been approved and marketed for less than three years or are still under development 
for these reasons  as of december  and for the foreseeable future  we cannot currently make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and payments that may become due to paul royalty under this financing 
therefore  it is premature to estimate the expected impact of this financing on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
accordingly  given these uncertainties  we have charged and  for the foreseeable future  we will continue to charge revenue interest expense for the revenue interest due to paul royalty as revenues subject to the revenue interest obligation are recognized 
revenue interest expense of   and  has been recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the revenue interest under this agreement is treated as interest expense in accordance with eitf  sales of future revenues 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with an asset and liability approach requiring the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded without consideration as to their ability to be realized 
the deferred tax asset includes net operating loss carryforwards  and the cumulative temporary differences related to certain research and patent costs  which have been charged to expense in our consolidated statements of operations but have been recorded as assets for tax return purposes 
these tax assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from to years for tax purposes 
the portion of any deferred tax asset  for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized  must then be offset by recording a valuation allowance against the asset 
a valuation allowance has been established against all of our deferred tax assets since  given our history of operating losses  the realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured 
accounting for stock options issued to employees and non employees we apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and related interpretations to account for our stock option plans 
under this method  compensation expense is computed and recorded on the date of grant for the intrinsic value related to stock options granted  reflected by the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
under sfas no 
 compensation cost for the fair value related to stock options is computed based on the value of the stock options at the date of grant using an option valuation methodology  typically the black scholes model 
as required by sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we apply the sfas no 
fair value method of accounting to non employee stock option grants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded   and  respectively  of expense related to sfas no 
for our non employee stock option grants 
for options granted to employees  sfas no 
allows a company either to record the black scholes model value of the stock options in its statement of operations or continue to record the apb no 
intrinsic value in its statement of operations and disclose the sfas no 
fair value 
for options granted to employees  we apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting under apb no 
 and disclose the sfas no 
fair value 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement revises sfas no 
 and requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
the effective date of this standard is interim and annual periods beginning after june  upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we will be required to expense stock options in our consolidated statements of operations when they are granted 
we estimate that the effect on net loss and loss per share in the periods following adoption of sfas no 
r will be consistent with our proforma disclosure under sfas no 
 except that estimated forfeitures will be considered in the calculation of compensation expense under sfas no 
r 
however  the actual effect on net loss and loss per share will vary depending upon the number of grants of options in compared to prior years 
further  we have not yet determined the actual model we will use to calculate fair value 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception  and we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from sales of our stock 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  as of december   was supplemented  during  by the receipt in july of   in net proceeds realized from the sale of  shares of our common stock to angiotech  as well as to  realized from the exercise of stock options and warrants and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
from these amounts    of cash was used in operations  which included  in working capital for the increase in accounts receivable and inventory  and  was used to purchase property and equipment

operating cash outflows our operating cash outflows for the twelve months ended december  have primarily been used for i the production of inventory  including  used for the inventory build to support the multiple commercial launches of new product configurations under our vitoss foam product platform  ii headcount additions  as we expand our field sales network and strengthen our sales management team  iii payment of sales commissions on growing product sales and iv operating expenses including sarbanes oxley compliance related activities 
additionally  operating cash outflows have continued to be utilized for development and pre clinical and clinical activities in preparation for regulatory filings of our products in our development pipeline 
in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to paul royalty during february net of the  balance in prepaid revenue interest expense outstanding as of december  during the year ended december   we paid kensey  for product inventory manufactured on our behalf 
in accordance with the angiotech agreement  during  we purchased from angiotech approximately  of centrifuge assets  which are used along with vitagel 
additionally  during the year ended december   we paid angiotech  for product inventory manufactured on our behalf 
our operating cash outflows for have primarily been used for the production of inventory  additional investments made in strengthening our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we did not have independent sales agency coverage or the territory is under served in order to support the growth of us product sales and the increased commissions paid to the independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us as a result of higher product sales 
in addition  funds have been used for development and pre clinical and clinical activities in preparation for regulatory filings of our products in development 
additionally for the year ended december   we paid a contractually required advance payment of  to paul royalty 
of the  paid to paul royalty   was earned during and the balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  operating cash flow requirements outlook we expect to focus our efforts on sales growth under our vitoss bone graft substitute product line for through additional extensions of our vitoss foam product line configurations and the launch of vitagel surgical hemostat  on the collection and publication of vitoss bone graft substitute post clinical data for marketing and sales purposes  and on continual improvements to our distribution channels 
we expect to continue to use cash to build inventories for new product launches and to support the launch of vitagel 
as a result  there may be future quarterly fluctuations in spending 
prior to the launch of each new product line configuration  significant inventory levels must be manufactured 
the inventory may be manufactured in anticipation of the receipt of regulatory clearance and may be initially built with one year shelf life  so as to accelerate the commercial launch of the product  once cleared  to our field sales network of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives 
if the inventory is built in the reporting periods prior to the receipt of the required regulatory clearance  the cost of the inventory manufactured will be expensed in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs 

table of contents in an effort to further increase sales of our new vitoss bone graft substitute product line configurations in future quarters  we intend to add direct sales representatives to our organization for those territories in the us where we either do not currently have independent sales agency coverage or the territory is under served 
additionally  we expect to continue to use cash and cash equivalents during in operating activities associated with clinical trials in the us for cortoss  research and development  product development for our vitoss bone graft substitute product line configurations and the endoskeleton ta platform  and the associated marketing and sales activities with vitoss bone graft substitute  imbibe and vitagel in the us and vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we expect to incur approximately million in external costs over the next two to three years in the execution of the cortoss pivotal clinical study in the us the timing of such expense is largely dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment in the study 
our operating cash flow requirements are heavily dependent upon the timing of receipt of fda k clearance for new product line configurations  the timing of inventory builds to support product launches and related inventory valuations  the timing of subsequent launches and acceptance of our new product line configurations  such as vitagel and vitoss foam pack  the rate at which we add new direct sales representatives and the rate at which our field sales network generates sales in their respective territories 
accordingly  for  our operating cash flow requirements may still be subjected to quarterly volatility  up or down 
if the fda does not clear additional new product line configurations under the k regulatory process  we do not expect sales to generate cash flow in excess of operating expenses for the foreseeable future  if at all 
until such sales levels are achieved  if ever  we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating activities 
agreement with kensey nash corporation in march  we entered into an agreement with kensey to jointly develop and commercialize new biomaterials based products 
kensey has the exclusive right to manufacture any jointly developed approved product for seven years from first commercial sale of the first jointly developed product and we will market and sell the product worldwide 
in march  the initial term of this agreement was extended by amendment for an additional three years 
following the regulatory clearance of a new product under the agreement  we have obligations to pay kensey for manufacturing the product  to achieve minimum sales levels in the first two years following commercialization of the first approved product under this agreement and make royalty payments to kensey based on the net sales of such product 
in december  we received fda k clearance for the first jointly developed product platform  vitoss foam  and we commenced sales of the first of several product configurations under the vitoss foam product platform during february approximately of our product sales during were from products co developed with kensey and we anticipate this percentage to increase during as of december   we owed kensey  for manufactured product inventory  which is included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
amounts due to kensey as of december  are expected to be paid by us during the first quarter of we expect the amount of product inventory to be manufactured by kensey on our behalf in to be approximately  which reflects a greater portion of inventory replenishment rather than launch quantity production 
agreement with cohesion technologies  inc in june  we entered into an agreement with cohesion technologies  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc  to distribute  market and sell costasis to be re branded as vitagel  a composite liquid hemostat  and the cellpaker collection system to surgical customers throughout north america  with an option to expand the territory to include the european union and the rest of the world 
under the agreement  we have obligations to purchase the products and make royalty payments to angiotech based on the net sales of such products and we have begun the process to allow us to assume the full responsibility for the oversight and management for the manufacturing of such products by early we expect to spend approximately  during to complete the transfer of manufacturing responsibilities  most of which is expected to be capitalized 
the gross margin percentage for vitagel and cellpaker is expected to be lower than that for our current vitoss bone graft substitute product line 
revenue interest the revenue interest provides for paul royalty to receive on the first  of annual sales  reducing to of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and rhakoss  in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
this revenue interest percentage is subject to increase to a maximum rate of on that portion of product sales that specifically relates to vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss  if we fail to meet contractually specified levels of annual net sales of products for which paul royalty is entitled to receive its revenue interest 
during the remaining term of the paul royalty revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  paul royalty paid to us  which represents the balance of the prepaid revenue interest expense outstanding as of december  in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to paul royalty during january the amount of the advance payment shall be  in each of the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of and to make the required  advance payment to paul royalty during and  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through advance payments affect cash flow when made  but they affect reported earnings only as the advance payments are credited within each period against the revenue interest actually earned by paul royalty during that period  with any excess advance payments to be refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if we fail to maintain certain specified balances and shareholders equity  paul royalty can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and paul royalty exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed paul royalty  as of december   we do not expect to fall out of compliance in the foreseeable future with the financial covenants of the revenue interest obligation 
net cash provided by used in investing activities investing cash inflows during and  we received  and  respectively  from the sale of investment grade marketable securities 
during the year ended december   we received  from the sale of used laboratory equipment 

table of contents investing cash outflows during the year ended december    was used for the purchase of investment grade short term and long term marketable securities  with a weighted average maturity of less than six months and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
we have invested  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  primarily for the purchase of manufacturing equipment  computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
investing cash outlook we expect the rate at which we invest funds in related to the purchase of leasehold improvements and capital equipment to increase by approximately  as compared to and the anticipated investments in additional manufacturing equipment primarily relate to our assumption in of full manufacturing responsibilities related to vitagel by early and to our vitoss bone graft substitute product line extensions

table of contents results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the detailed discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
as noted above  we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december product sales 
product sales for increased to  from  in sales growth was primarily attributable to the expansion of our existing product portfolio and improved market penetration in the us  reflecting the increased size of the us field sales network  which resulted in improved market coverage 
for the year ended december  and  and of product sales  respectively  were in the us  primarily from sales of vitoss bone graft substitute and imbibe 
the remaining sales  during and  were a result of vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and aliquot sales outside the us  primarily in europe 
gross profit 
gross profit for the full year and was  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was for  as compared to for the gross profit percentage for was negatively impacted by a  adjustment to write down inventory to its net realizable value 
the write down of inventory arose from the shift in product mix toward certain vitoss foam products introduced in and one year shelf life packaging on other vitoss foam products 
the  adjustment to write down inventory during the year ended december  lowered the gross profit percentage by for the period 
the lower gross profit percentage for was further affected by the shift in product mix toward the vitoss foam product platform  which has a lower gross profit percentage on a higher average selling price per unit as compared to our other products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  which represents a increase as compared to a increase in product sales for year 
general administrative expenses for increased to  from  for primarily due to consulting costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives  patent related legal expenses in connection with additional filings associated with our new products  and additional headcount 
general administrative expenses decreased to of product sales for as compared to of product sales for selling marketing expenses were  for the year ended december   a increase from  for the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses increased for the twelve months ended december  primarily due to higher salary and benefit costs incurred by increasing the size of our sales management team and expanding our field sales team of direct sales representatives to support the growth of u 
s product sales 
the remainder of the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due to higher commissions paid in the us as a result of increased product sales in selling marketing expenses decreased to of product sales for as compared to of product sales for research development expenses increased to  for from  for the increase is primarily due to development work associated with additional product configurations to be sold under our vitoss foam platform and costs associated with restarting and revalidating our cortoss manufacturing facility 
research development expenses decreased to of product sales for as compared to of product sales during we expect research and development expenses to increase in as a result of our cortoss clinical trial in the us net other expense 
net other expense includes interest income  interest expense and revenue interest expense 
we recorded  and  of net other expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net other expense is primarily attributed to higher revenue interest expense incurred under the arrangement with paul royalty due to higher product sales 
this increase in net other expense was partially offset by higher interest income as a result of higher average cash  cash equivalent  short term and long term investment balances 
dividends on preferred stock 
for the year ended december   dividends declared of  were paid in  shares of our common stock to holders of our series a adjustable cumulative convertible voting preferred stock the series a preferred stock 
in addition  for the year ended december   we recorded  to recognize the deemed dividend as it relates to the increasing dividend rate  which was applicable to the series a preferred stock in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 increasing rate preferred stock sab 
there were no dividends or deemed dividends recorded during as a result of conversion of the majority of the series a preferred stock to common stock on june  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december product sales 
product sales for increased to  as compared to  for the product sales increase from to is primarily attributable to market penetration of our vitoss micro morsels and macro morsels product configurations  which are sold under our vitoss bone graft substitute product platform in the us additionally  the improved penetration resulted from the addition during the second half of of our first direct sales representatives in our us field sales network to improve our distribution and market coverage 
approximately of product sales for were from vitoss bone graft substitute and imbibe sales in the us  as compared to approximately of product sales from the us during the remaining sales during both and were primarily a result of vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss sales in europe 
gross profit 
our gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product sales 
in comparison  our gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product sales 
the decrease in gross profit margins for in comparison to is due to the slightly lower margins on the new product configurations sold under our vitoss bone graft substitute platform in the us as well as slightly higher proportion of sales from outside of the us during  where the average selling price is lower in comparison to the us operating expenses 
operating expenses for year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in general administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease from  in the lower general administrative expenses were principally due to lower administrative headcount related costs 
for the year ended december   selling marketing expenses increased to  from  in the comparable period last year 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was principally due to the expansion of our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territory is under served in order to support the growth of us product sales and the increased commissions paid to the independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us as a result of higher product sales 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased to  from  during the same period in  due to the completion in of certain process development work relative to cortoss 
net other expense 
net other expense includes interest income  interest expense and revenue interest expense 
we recorded  and  of net other expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net other expense between and is primarily attributable to higher revenue interest expense under the arrangement with paul royalty incurred as a result of higher product sales 

table of contents dividends on preferred stock during the years ended december  and  we declared and paid dividends of  and  respectively  on the series a preferred stock 
these dividends were paid in kind by issuing an aggregate of  and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
due to the automatic conversion during the second quarter of of the series a preferred stock described above  no dividends were required to be paid for periods after march  during the third and fourth quarters of the year ended december   we recorded a charge of  that represented a deemed dividend relating to the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature of the series a preferred stock 
the original terms of the series a preferred stock stated that beginning after june   for any shares of series a preferred stock still outstanding and not converted to common stock  the dividend rate will increase each quarter by an additional two percentage points per year  up to a maximum dividend rate of per year 
accordingly  for the years ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  of dividend accretion related to the higher dividend rates applicable to the series a preferred stock for periods beginning after june  in accordance with sab it was determined that the series a preferred stock has a beneficial conversion feature bcf in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios and eitf issue no 
we consider the quarterly reporting period in which the bcf was recognized to be appropriately excludable from the period of dividend attribution as described in sab  since the third quarter of already included a disproportionate dividend attribution 
due to the bcf on the july closing  we commenced recognition of the implied discount addressed in sab in the fourth quarter of similarly  for the october closing  no additional dividend was recorded pursuant to sab as the fourth quarter of included the bcf for the october closing 
the sab discount relating to the october closing began to be recorded in the first quarter of certain risks related to our business if losses continue in the long term  it could limit our growth in the orthopedic industry and jeopardize our viability 
we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from proceeds received from sales of our stock 
in july  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock to angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments of  as of december   will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements into to date  we have not been profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and  at december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have resulted principally from the development and patenting of our technologies  pre clinical and clinical studies  preparation of submissions to the fda and foreign regulatory bodies  the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  and unforeseen competitor developments which adversely affect our distribution channels 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts  expand our marketing and sales activities and further develop our manufacturing capabilities 
we may not ever successfully commercialize our products in development 
we may never be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future and our products may never be commercially accepted or generate sufficient product sales to fund operations 
if we fail to meet our obligations under a revenue sharing agreement  we may be required to repurchase from an investor its right to receive revenues on certain of our product sales  and the investor could foreclose on certain assets that are essential to our operations 
during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul royalty 
in this financing  we sold paul royalty a revenue interest and shares of our common stock 
the revenue interest provides for paul royalty to receive on the first  of annual sales  reducing to of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and rhakoss  in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
this revenue interest percentage is subject to increase to a maximum rate of on that portion of product sales specifically related to vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss synthetic cortical bone if we fail to meet contractually specified levels of annual net sales of products for which paul royalty is entitled to receive its revenue interest 
we do not currently expect that changes in the revenue interest percentage resulting from fluctuations in sales of products subject to the revenue interest will have a material effect on operating results for a period when considered relative to sales of the products for that period 
throughout the term of the paul royalty revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  we paid to paul royalty the contractually required advance payment of  of the  paid to paul royalty   was earned in and the balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to paul royalty during february  net of the  balance in prepaid revenue interest expense outstanding as of december  during the year ended december    of revenue interest expense was earned by paul royalty 
the prepaid balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to paul royalty during january paul royalty paid to us the  balance in prepaid revenue interest expense outstanding as of december  the amount of the advance payment remains  in each of the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payments to paul royalty during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through advance payments impact cash flow when made  and they affect earnings only as the advance payments are credited within each period against the revenue interest actually earned by paul royalty during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by our licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and rhakoss  in north america and europe  and the revenue interest we pay to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  on the sales of our products collectively  the pledged assets 
we are also required to maintain cash and cash equivalent balances equal to or greater than the product of i times ii total operating losses  net of non cash charges  for the preceding fiscal quarter  and total shareholders equity of at least  provided  however  that under the provisions of the agreement with paul royalty  when calculating shareholders equity for the purposes of the financial covenants  the revenue interest obligation is included in shareholders equity at its carrying value 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if we fail to maintain such balances and shareholders equity  paul royalty can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 

table of contents in addition to the failure to comply with the financial covenants described above  the occurrence of certain events  including those set forth below  triggers paul royalty s right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest a judicial decision that has a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  the acceleration of our obligations or the exercise of default remedies by a secured lender under certain debt instruments  a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy that involves us or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  our insolvency  a change in control of our company  and the breach of a representation  warranty or certification made by us in the agreements with paul royalty that  individually or in the aggregate  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  and such breach is not cured within days after notice of the breach from paul royalty 
in addition  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single source material used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with paul royalty 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and paul royalty exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed paul royalty  the repurchase price for paul royalty s revenue interest as of a given date is calculated in three steps 
first  a specified annual rate of return not to exceed is applied to paul royalty s  original purchase price from october  to the date of determination of the repurchase price 
second  the result obtained from the first step of the calculation is added to the original  purchase price 
third  the sum obtained from the second step of the calculation is reduced by the sum of  and the actual amount of revenue interest paid during the specified period 
if we were unable to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event  paul royalty could foreclose on the pledged assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
paul royalty could also foreclose on the pledged assets if we became insolvent or involved in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding 
no repurchase events or foreclosures have occurred as of the date of this filing 
in the event that we repurchased paul royalty s revenue interest  paul royalty would have no obligation to surrender the shares of our common stock that it had purchased as part of the revenue interests assignment transaction 
if we are unable to increase sales of our approved products  our operating results will be affected adversely 
because several of our products have only been recently approved and launched  and the markets for our products are evolving  we cannot accurately predict either the future growth rate of product sales  if any  or the ultimate size of these markets 
certain factors that may limit our ability to increase sales include our dependence on the efforts of independent agents and distributors to promote the use of our products  over which we have limited control  the introduction of new products into the market by other orthopedic companies based upon competing technologies  our dependence on the continued publication of independent pre clinical and clinical data to support the use of our products  our need to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  and the need for payors to authorize insurance reimbursement for procedures using our products 
market acceptance of our products will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and ease of use 
surgeons will not use our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and recommendations from other surgeons and mentors  that our products are safe and effective 
our products are based on new technologies that have not previously been used and compete with more established treatments currently accepted as the standards of care 
the attributes of some of our products may require some changes in surgical techniques that have become standard within the medical community  and there may be resistance to change 
therefore  for these products  we must be able to convince surgeons who currently favor existing techniques to switch to new procedures that would facilitate use of our products 
many surgeons will not purchase our products until there is sufficient  long term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement for our products 
we believe our product sales to date have been made to a relatively small group of early adopting surgeons 
any failure to gain market acceptance of our products could result in lower sales and our inability to become profitable 
if we are unable to operate an effective sales and distribution network  our ability to generate sales and become profitable will be impaired 
we have assembled a field sales network of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us in order to market vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel and imbibe 
outside of the us  we utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and aliquot 
we seek to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us territories where we either do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are underserved 
we are dependent upon our distributors  sales agencies and direct sales representatives for the sale of our products 
any failure to maintain and effectively manage our distribution network will impair our ability to generate additional sales and become profitable 
there can be no assurance that the distributors and agencies will perform their obligations in their respective territories as expected  or that we will continue to derive any revenue from these arrangements 
we cannot assure that our interests will continue to coincide with those of our distributors and agencies 
in addition  we cannot assure that our distributors and agencies will not develop independently  or with other companies  other competitive products 
the independent us agencies selling vitoss bone graft substitute generally sell products from other orthopedic companies 
a single agency may sell vitoss bone graft substitute  as well as hardware manufactured by other orthopedic companies consisting of metal plates  screws and titanium spinal cages  to end user hospitals 
our sales could be adversely affected if  for any reason  one or more of our successful agencies lost their hardware product line provided by other orthopedic companies 
additionally  our independent agencies may be unable or unwilling to carry or effectively sell vitoss bone graft substitute as a result of the introduction of new products into the market based upon other technologies that could compete with vitoss bone graft substitute 
our sales could be adversely affected if one or more of our successful agencies eliminated vitoss bone graft substitute from their product line for any other reason and terminated their agency arrangement with us 
the complete product line represented by the distributors and agencies  including our products  is an important factor in the distributors or agencies ability to penetrate the market 
accordingly  our ability to penetrate the markets that we intend to serve is highly dependent upon the quality and breadth of the other product lines carried by our distribution network  the components of which may change from time to time  and over which we have little or no control 
although we believe that we have fully built our sales management team  in an effort to further accelerate the growth of sales  we continue to add direct sales representatives to our organization for certain open or underserved territories in the us the addition of direct sales representatives will increase our operating 
table of contents expenses 
furthermore  there is no assurance that adding direct sales representatives will improve sales or that our direct sales representatives will be successful in generating sufficient sales to cover the cost of supporting their sales activities 
there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to market or sell our products or that we will successfully implement this type of sales and distribution method 
the unapproved or off label use of our products could adversely affect the reputation of our products 
the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  the european union medical devices directive and other worldwide regulatory agencies 
in order to market our products  we must apply for  receive and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals in each applicable jurisdiction for specified uses of the products 
under fda regulations  we are only permitted to commercially distribute our products for approved indication s or use s  failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to fda enforcement 
we believe that there has been an unmet medical need for an injectable material for use in procedures done to repair vertebral compression fractures 
in an attempt to address this need  we pursued clinical studies in europe to demonstrate the safety of using our injectable product cortoss in this type of procedure 
cortoss subsequently received ce certification in january for use in repairing vertebral compression fractures 
however  surgeons may have attempted to use cortoss off label in procedures to repair vertebral compression fractures performed prior to the european union s approval of cortoss for this type of procedure 
furthermore  all surgeons have not been trained in the proper use of cortoss to repair vertical compression fractures since the european union only recently approved the use of cortoss for that type of procedure 
a surgeon who has not been properly trained to use cortoss in a procedure to repair vertebral compression fractures could pose a risk to the reputation of our cortoss product 
the occurrence of an adverse event while using our product off label could negatively affect the reputation of cortoss or any of our other products as well as us 
our plan to assume manufacturing of vitagel may not be successful 
angiotech intends to close their vitagel manufacturing facility during september and we will assume full manufacturing for the vitagel product in early in order to bridge the vitagel supply of product until our orthovita facility is fully operational in early  angiotech must produce enough vitagel at their facility through september of to fulfill our sales forecast through the first half of we believe angiotech will manufacture enough vitagel to supply our customers until our facility is operational in if we do not successfully train a sufficient number of surgeons in the use of our products  demand for our products could be adversely affected 
it is critical to the commercial success of our products that our independent distributors  agents and direct sales representatives succeed in training a sufficient number of surgeons in the use of our products 
this training requires a commitment of time and money by surgeons that they may be unwilling to give 
even if surgeons are willing  if they are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury  negative publicity or lawsuits against us  any of which could damage our business and reduce product sales 
if health care providers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for procedures using our products  or if such reimbursement is inadequate  we may never become profitable 
successful sales of our products in the us and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals and surgeons that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
both public and private insurance reimbursement plans are important factors in determining whether new products will be accepted 
healthcare providers may refuse to use our products if reimbursement is inadequate 
we do not yet know how reimbursement will be handled for all of our products because some procedures that use our products are new and reimbursement policies regarding these procedures have not been finalized 
inadequate reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could prevent growth in  and even significantly reduce usage of  our products 
moreover  failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain coverage or reimbursement from third party payors or changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products would reduce demand for our products 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products profitably 
we may need to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to raise additional capital in the future  our product development could be limited and our long term viability may be threatened  however  if we raise additional capital  your percentage ownership as a shareholder of orthovita will decrease and constraints could be placed on the operation of our business 
however  there are factors that may cause our future capital requirements to be greater than anticipated or could accelerate our need for funds including  without imitation unforeseen developments during our pre clinical and clinical trials  delays in the timing of receipt of required regulatory approvals  unforeseen difficulties in operating an effective direct sales and distribution network  unanticipated expenditures in research and product development or manufacturing activities  delayed or lack of market acceptance of our products  unanticipated expenditures in the acquisition and defense of intellectual property rights  the failure to develop strategic alliances for the marketing of some of our products  unforeseen changes in healthcare reimbursement for procedures using our products  inability to increase sales of our approved products  inability to train a sufficient number of surgeons in the use of our products to create demand for our products  difficulties in maintaining commercial scale manufacturing capacity and capability  unforeseen problems with our third party manufacturers and service providers or with our specialty suppliers of certain raw materials  unanticipated difficulties in operating in international markets  inability to meet our obligations under a revenue sharing agreement  the need to respond to technological changes and increased competition  unforeseen problems in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to market our products  enactment of new legislation or administrative regulation  the application to our business of new court decisions and regulatory interpretations  
table of contents claims that might be brought in excess of our insurance coverage  any imposition of penalties for failure to comply with regulatory guidelines  or management s perception that uncertainties relating to these factors may be increasing 
in addition  although we have no present commitments or understandings to do so  we may seek to expand our operations and product line through acquisitions or joint ventures 
any such acquisitions or joint ventures may increase our capital requirements 
while we have no immediate plans to do so  we may seek to obtain additional funds in the future through subsequent equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties  either alone or in conjunction with equity 
these financings could result in substantial dilution to our shareholders or require debt service and or revenue sharing arrangements 
any such financing may not be available or  if available  may only be available on unfavorable terms 
if adequate financing is not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain operations 
in the worst case  our long term viability would be threatened 
if we fail to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell our products  sales could be delayed or never realized 
the jurisdictions in which we will seek to market our products will regulate these products as medical devices 
in most circumstances  we and our distributors and agents must obtain regulatory approvals and otherwise comply with extensive regulations regarding safety  quality and efficacy standards 
these regulations vary from country to country  and the regulatory review can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we may not obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to market our products in our targeted markets 
moreover  regulatory approvals that are obtained may involve significant restrictions on the anatomic sites and types of procedures for which our products can be used 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our regulatory approvals 
if we do not obtain or maintain regulatory approvals to enable us to market our products in the us or elsewhere  or if the approvals are subject to significant restrictions  we may never generate significant revenues 
the regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we currently market or intend to market our products are summarized below 
united states regulation by fda 
the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
to date  we have received k clearance from the fda to market our vitoss bone graft substitute and imbibe labels 
during and  we received approval from the fda to conduct two pilot clinical studies in the united states for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation 
there can be no assurance that the data from these clinical trials will support fda clearance or approval to market this product for the designated use 
we are currently manufacturing vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss in the us  distributing vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel and imbibe in the us  and distributing vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we are manufacturing imbibe and aliquot in the us through outside third party contract manufacturers 
in addition  during march  we entered into an agreement with kensey whereby  for a period of seven years  kensey will have the exclusive right to manufacture any approved jointly developed products under the agreement  including the vitoss foam product platform 
in march  the initial term of the agreement was extended by amendment for an additional three years 
vitagel and cellpaker will be manufactured by angiotech under a june agreement until such time as we have completed the assumption of oversight and management for the manufacturing of such products 
vitoss bone graft substitute  as well as any other products that we manufacture or distribute following their approval by the fda  will be subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of the product 
moreover  modifications to the approved or cleared product may require the submission of a new k notification or premarket approval application or premarket application supplement 
we may not be successful in obtaining approval to market the modified product in a timely manner  if at all 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
european union and other international markets general 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are sold 
accordingly  the introduction of our products in markets outside the united states will be subject to regulatory clearances in those jurisdictions 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging and labeling requirements and import restrictions on medical devices 
in addition  each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the approval by foreign government authorities is uncertain and can be expensive 
our ability to market our products could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  the necessary approvals or clearances 
requirement of ce certification in the european union 
to market a product in the european union  we must be entitled to affix a ce certification  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
a ce certification enables us to market a product in all of the countries of the european union  as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
to date  we have received a ce certification for the use of vitoss bone graft substitute as a bone void filler and for the use of cortoss in screw augmentation and vertebral augmentation procedures 
there can be no assurance that we will receive ce certifications for cortoss for any other indications for use or that we will receive ce certifications for other products 
if we do not manage commercial scale manufacturing capability and capacity for our products in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner  our product sales may suffer 
our vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss synthetic cortical bone manufacturing facilities produce commercial products and are currently certified as meeting the requirements of iso for the period march  through march  and european norm for the period july  through july   and are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
in addition to the need for regulatory approval in the us for cortoss  in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  its manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must first pass inspection by the fda 
our product sales depend upon  among other things  our ability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner 
the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies for compliance with quality standards 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will not  during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities  identify what they consider to be deficiencies in meeting the applicable standards and request or seek remedial action 

table of contents failure to comply with such regulations or a delay in attaining compliance may result in warning letters  injunctions suspending our manufacture of products  civil and criminal penalties  refusal to grant premarket approvals  ce certifications or clearances to products that are subject to future or pending submissions  product recalls or seizures of products  and total or partial suspensions of production 
we are dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
our ability to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss and to have vitoss foam and vitagel manufactured for us is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp although we believe that we maintain good relationships with our suppliers  there can be no guarantee that such supplies and services will continue to be available with respect to our current and future commercialized products 
we are dependent on kensey and other third party manufacturers for the supply of products that we may sell 
we are manufacturing imbibe and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our third party manufacturers are either iso certified or meet our quality system requirements 
in addition  during march  we entered into an agreement with kensey to jointly develop and commercialize new biomaterials based spine products 
the new products that may be developed under this agreement will be based on our proprietary vitoss bone graft substitute in combination with biomaterials proprietary to kensey 
kensey will have the exclusive right to manufacture any such approved jointly developed products under the agreement for a period of seven years 
in march  the initial term of the agreement was extended by amendment for an additional three years 
such jointly developed products comprised of our total product sales for and we anticipate this percentage to increase for there can be no guarantee these third party manufacturers will continue to provide such supplies and services with respect to our current and future commercialized products 
the difficulties of operating in international markets may harm sales of our products 
the international nature of our business subjects us and our representatives  agents and distributors to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate  and in which our products are sold 
the types of risks that we face in international operations include the imposition of governmental controls  logistical difficulties in managing international operations  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted if we cannot successfully meet the challenges of operating internationally 
our results of operations may fluctuate due to factors out of our control  which could cause volatility in our stock price 
vitoss bone graft substitute  imbibe  cortoss and aliquot are currently our only products for which we have received regulatory approvals for sale 
vitoss bone graft substitute is cleared for sale in the us and the european union 
imbibe is cleared for sale in the us cortoss and aliquot are cleared for sale in the european union 
in addition  we obtained distribution rights to vitagel and cellpaker in june and launched that product in the us in january future levels of vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel  cortoss  aliquot  cellpaker and imbibe product sales are difficult to predict 
vitoss bone graft substitute product sales to date may not be indicative of future sales levels 
vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and aliquot sales levels in europe may fluctuate due to the timing of any distributor stocking orders and vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel  imbibe and cellpaker sales levels may fluctuate in the us due to the timing of orders from hospitals 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of additional factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the timing of governmental approvals for our products and our competitors products  unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials of our products  the medical community s acceptance of our products  the timing in obtaining adequate third party reimbursement of our products  the success of competitive products  our ability to enter into strategic alliances with other companies  expenses associated with development and protection of intellectual property matters  establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  events affecting logistics and elective surgery trends  the timing of expenses related to commercialization of new products  competitive disruptions to our distribution channels  and the adequate training of a sufficient number of surgeons in the use of our products 
the results of our operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may not meet expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this may cause our stock price to be volatile 
our business will be damaged if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to our products  and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these measures afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
as of december   we own or control twelve issued us patents and sixteen pending patent applications in the us  and several counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications worldwide  including canada  europe  mexico and 
table of contents japan 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications 
moreover  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or we were the first to file patent applications for the relevant inventions for the following reasons patent applications filed prior to december in the us are maintained in secrecy until issued  patent applications filed after november in the us are maintained in secrecy until eighteen months from the date of filing  and the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries 
if we do receive a patent  it may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary position in the technology or to be commercially useful to us 
in addition  if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us finally  even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs to us and result in a diversion of management attention 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors could use the intellectual property that we have developed to enhance their products and compete more directly with us  which could damage our business 
in addition to the risk of failing to adequately protect our proprietary rights  there is a risk that we may become subject to a claim that we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
although we do not believe that we are infringing the rights of others  third parties may claim that we are doing so 
there is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally  and in the spinal market segments particularly 
if the holder of patents brought an infringement action against us  the cost of litigating the claim could be substantial and divert management attention 
in addition  if a court determined that one of our products infringed a patent  we could be prevented from selling that product unless we could obtain a license from the owner of the patent 
a license may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
modification of our products or development of new products to avoid infringement may require us to conduct additional clinical trials for these new or modified products and to revise our filings with the fda  which is time consuming and expensive 
if we were not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our product  our business could suffer 
if we cannot keep up with technological changes and marketing initiatives of competitors  sales of our products may be harmed 
extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopedic market 
we anticipate that we will face intense competition from medical device  medical products and pharmaceutical companies 
for instance  several pmma bone cement received k clearance in for vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
further  in  the spinal bone grafting market saw the introduction of total disk replacement devices tdrs as treatment alternative for degenerative disk disease designed to preserve the motion of the vertebrae of the spine 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by these and other competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals  or patent protection  for competitive products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize competing products in advance of our products 
they may also enjoy substantial advantages over us in terms of research and development expertise  experience in conducting clinical trials  experience in regulatory matters  manufacturing efficiency  name recognition  sales and marketing expertise  established distribution channels  and established relationships with health care providers and payors 
these advantages may adversely affect our plans for market acceptance of our products 
we may acquire technologies or companies in the future  and these acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders and disruption of our business 
entering into an acquisition could divert management attention 
we also could fail to assimilate the acquired company  which could lead to higher operating expenses 
finally  our shareholders could be diluted if we issue shares of our stock to acquire another company or technology 
provisions of pennsylvania law or our articles of incorporation may deter a third party from seeking to obtain control of us or may affect your rights as a shareholder 
certain provisions of pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  our articles of incorporation enable our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock having rights  privileges and preferences as are determined by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of our common shareholders 
for example  an issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the common shareholders  make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
our board previously designated  shares of preferred stock as series a adjustable cumulative convertible voting preferred stock  of which shares are issued and outstanding as of december  however  holders of the outstanding shares of our series a stock are not currently entitled to vote these shares and will not be able to vote them until automatically converted into  shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the series a preferred stock  and they have no rights superior to those of holders of our common stock 
the rights of the series a preferred stock are described in our current report on form k filed with the commission on july  we may issue additional shares of our authorized preferred stock at any time 

table of contents we do not intend to pay any cash dividends to our common shareholders 
we have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
our stock price may be volatile 
our stock price  like that of many small cap medical technology companies  may be volatile 
in general  equity markets  including nasdaq  have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the following factors could also cause our stock price to be volatile or decrease fluctuations in our results of operations  under performance in relation to analysts estimates or financial guidance provided by us  changes in the financial guidance we provide to the investment community  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our stock  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  issues in establishing commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  disruptions with our third party manufacturers for the supply of certain products that we may sell  unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials  fda and international regulatory actions regarding us or our competitors  determinations by governments and insurance companies regarding reimbursement for medical procedures using our or our competitors products  the medical community s acceptance of our products  product sales growth rates  difficulties in establishing and expanding our distribution channels  disruptions to our distribution channels as a result of competitive market changes  product recalls  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or by others  changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  business conditions affecting other medical device companies or the medical device industry generally  and general market conditions  particularly for companies with small market capitalizations 
if we are sued in a product liability action  we could be forced to pay substantial damages and the attention of our management team may be diverted from operating our business 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in surgery  and we may be subject to a product liability lawsuit 
in particular  the market for spine products has a history of product liability litigation 
under certain of our agreements with our distributors and sales agencies  we indemnify the distributor or sales agency from product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  whether meritorious or not  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
we maintain product liability insurance in the annual aggregate amount of up to million  although our insurance policies have various exclusions 
thus  we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
even in the absence of a claim  our insurance rates may rise in the future to a point where we may decide not to carry this insurance 
even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim would be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of management s attention from our core business 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain the services of key employees 
we depend substantially upon the continued service and performance of our existing executive officers 
we rely on key personnel in formulating and implementing our product research  development and commercialization strategies 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
if one or more of our key employees resigns  the loss of that employee could harm our business 
if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees  despite our use of confidentiality agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the functional currency for our european branch operation is the euro 
accordingly  in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation  all assets and liabilities related to this operation are translated at the current exchange rates at the end of each period 
the resulting translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity 
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period with foreign currency transaction gains and losses  if any  included in results of operations 
as of december   our total exposure to foreign currency risk in us dollar terms was approximately  or  of our total assets 
the potential impact of a hypothetical decline in the euro foreign exchange rate would result in a total decline in the fair value of our assets of approximately  at december  
table of contents market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in market interest rates that could affect the value of our short term and long term investments  however  we do not believe the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would be significantly affected by changes in interest rates due mainly to the relatively short term nature of the majority of our investment portfolio 
as of december   our investments consisted of highly liquid investment grade marketable securities including corporate commercial paper and us government agency bonds 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of fully insured bank certificates of deposit 
the impact on our future interest income and future changes in investment yields will depend on the gross amount of our investments and various external economic factors
