overview the company is the nation s largest domestic inland tank barge operator with a fleet of active tank barges and towing vessels 
the company uses the inland waterway system of the us to transport bulk liquids including petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals 
through its diesel engine services segment  the company provides after market services for large medium speed and high speed diesel engines used in marine  power generation and railroad applications 
during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies in the us products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers every day plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others 
consequently  the company s business tends to mirror the general performance of the us economy and the performance of the company s customer base 
the following table shows the products transported by the company  the revenue distribution for  the uses of these products and the factors that drive the demand for the products the company transports end uses of products transported revenue products moved distribution uses of products moved drivers petrochemicals plastics  fibers  paper  gasoline additives housing  consumer goods  autos  clothing  vehicle usages black oil products asphalt  boiler fuel  no

oil  jet fuel  heating oil vehicle usage  air travel  weather conditions agricultural chemicals liquid fertilizers  chemical feedstocks corn  cotton  wheat production for  the company reported the highest revenue  net earnings  and earnings per share in its history 
the company reported net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  the record setting results reflect the improvement during in the us and global economies  as the us petrochemical industry and us refining industry operated their plants and refineries at higher utilization rates  which generated increased volumes for the marine transportation segment 
the results also reflect the full impact of the company s january  acquisition of the seariver inland marine transportation fleet  more fully described under acquisitions below 
the company s marine transportation segment revenue and operating income for increased and  respectively  when compared with the company s largest marine transportation market is the petrochemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue 
during  the petrochemical market remained firm  as contract customers continued to operate their plants at high utilization rates  generating strong volumes 
the black oil products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  also remained strong  the result of high us refinery production and resulting greater volumes of heavier refinery residual oil by products 
refined petroleum products contributed of marine transportation revenue and experienced typical gulf coast to midwest demand during the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  remained weak for most of despite low midwest inventory levels  as high prices for liquid fertilizer products curtailed demand 
the company was successful in modestly raising marine transportation rates on contract renewals during  generally on average of to  a continuation of a trend that started during the fourth quarter 
depending on when the contract was priced to market  some contracts were increased by a higher percentage  while others were adjusted by a lower percentage 
in addition  effective january   contract escalators for labor and the producer price index on numerous multiyear contracts resulted in a rate increase for those contracts of approximately 
the company adjusts contract rates for fuel on either a monthly or quarterly basis  depending on the specific contract 
spot market rates during the year were to higher than for most marine transportation markets and above contract rates 
during  approximately of the company s marine transportation revenue was under term contracts with the remaining in the spot market 
the contract and spot market mix provides the company with a stable revenue stream with less exposure to day to day pricing fluctuations 
the marine transportation segment s results were negatively impacted by record setting navigational delays  creating major logistic challenges for the segment 
delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and barge during transit 
the measure includes transit delays caused by weather  lock congestion or closure and other navigational factors 
delay days for totaled  a increase over  days experienced for the delay days included key lock closures for repairs on the gulf intracoastal waterway and the ohio river  high water conditions during the second and fourth quarters  hurricane ivan in september  and a significant number of fog days along the gulf coast in the first and fourth quarters 
the marine transportation segment s operating margin improved to in compared with in the improved margin reflected the additional volumes transported  the contract rate increases and higher spot market rates  partially offset by the operating inefficiencies caused by the record delay days 
the higher operating margin also reflected the company s on going effort to eliminate unnecessary costs and improve the management of towing requirements  including more efficient use of horsepower  faster barge turnarounds and increased backhaul opportunities 
the company s diesel engine services segment s revenue and operating income increased and  respectively  when compared with the results reflect the april acquisition of walker s operations and parts inventory  partial recovery in the midwest dry cargo market  and increased direct parts sales to nuclear power generation and railroad customers 
the east coast and west coast marine markets were weak for the majority of  but showed some improvement in the fourth quarter 
the gulf coast offshore well service market remained weak during all of operating margin for the diesel engine services segment for was compared with for the company continued to generate strong operating cash flow during  with net cash provided from operations totaling  an increase of  over the cash was used for acquisitions totaling  including the walker and osprey acquisitions described under acquisitions below  and the purchase of three pre owned tank barges  capital expenditures totaling  primarily for fleet replacement and enhancement  and long term debt reduction of  the company reduced its debt to capitalization ratio from to during in november  the company prepaid  of its  private placement loan 
at december    million of the remaining  outstanding was hedged against interest rate exposure with interest rate swaps 
at december    was outstanding under the company s  unsecured revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures totaled  in and included  for new tank barge construction and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet 
the company s new barge construction program for replaced older tank barges retired from service without adding additional capacity 
for  the company projects that capital expenditures will total  to  including  for new tank barge construction 
the program includes the construction of double hull   barrel capacity  tank barges at a cost of  subject to adjustment for the price of steel 
these tank barges  of which are scheduled for delivery in and one in  are replacement barges for older tank barges scheduled to be removed from service 
in addition  the program will also include double hull   barrel capacity  tank barges and one double hull   barrel capacity  specialty tank barge at a cost of  subject to adjustment for the price of steel 
these tank barges  scheduled for delivery primarily in the second half of  will be additional capacity  positioning the company to obtain petrochemical movements it currently does not have the capacity to handle 
the company is in excellent financial position to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in a consolidating marine transportation industry 
external growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of inland tank barge operations that become available as a result of fleet replacement decisions faced by other operators  and outsourcing by shippers and customers seeking to single source tank barge requirements 
increasing the fleet size would allow the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  barges positioned closer to cargos  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power  minimal incremental administrative staff and less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargoes 
the company anticipates that during  the us and global economies will be stable to modestly improving  which may lead to an increase in petrochemical volumes transported by the company s marine transportation segment 
however  continued high and volatile feedstock and energy costs could slow down or delay any improvement in petrochemical volumes 
industry wide  tank barge capacity declined during and  and remained relatively constant in in  some incremental capacity was added to the industry fleet 
a smaller industry wide tank barge capacity supports higher industry utilization and an improved pricing environment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectable receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectable amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectable amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  a significant change in the level of uncollectable amounts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
routine maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred on an annual basis 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance 
acquisitions in march  the company purchased the cargo carriers fleet of inland tank barges for  in cash from cargill  and resold six of the tank barges for  in april on october   the company completed the acquisition of seven inland tank barges and inland towboats from coastal for  in cash 
in addition  the company and coastal entered into a barge management agreement whereby the company will serve as manager of the two companies combined black oil fleet for a period of seven years 
the combined black oil fleet consists of barges owned by coastal  of which are currently active  and the company s active black oil barges 
in a related transaction  on september   the company purchased from coastal three black oil tank barges for  in cash 
on december   the company purchased double hull inland tank barges from union carbide for  in february  the company had entered into a long term lease with union carbide for the inland tank barges 
the inland tank barges were acquired by dow as part of the february  merger between union carbide and dow 
nine of the inland tank barges were out of service and subsequently sold 
on january   the company purchased from seariver  the us transportation affiliate of exxonmobil  double hull inland tank barges and seven inland towboats for  in cash  and assumed from seariver the leases of double hull inland tank barges 
on february   the company purchased three double hull inland tank barges leased by seariver from banc of america leasing for  in cash 
in addition  the company entered into a contract to provide inland marine transportation services to seariver 
on april   the company purchased from walker  a subsidiary of ingram  walker s diesel engine service operations and parts inventory located in paducah  kentucky for  in cash 
in addition  the company entered into a contract to provide diesel engine services to ingram 
on april   the company purchased a one third interest in osprey for  the purchase price consisted of cash of  and notes payable totaling  due in april the remaining two thirds interest is owned by cooper t 
smith corporation and richard l 
couch 
osprey  formed in  operates a barge feeder service for cargo containers between houston  new orleans and baton rouge  several ports located above baton rouge on the mississippi river  as well as coastal service along the gulf of mexico 
revenues for osprey for were approximately  results of operations the company reported net earnings of  or per share on revenues of  compared with net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  for  and net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  for the year included  before taxes   after taxes  or

marine transportation the company  through its marine transportation segment  is a provider of marine transportation services  operating a current fleet of active inland tank barges and active inland towing vessels  transporting petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals along the united states inland waterways 
the marine transportation segment is also the managing partner of a owned offshore marine partnership  consisting of four dry bulk barge and tug units 
the partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the following table sets forth the company s marine transportation segment s revenues  costs and expenses  operating income and operating margins for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to marine transportation revenues costs and expenses costs of sales and operating expenses selling  general and administrative taxes  other than on income depreciation and amortization operating income operating margins compared with marine transportation revenues marine transportation revenues for increased compared with  reflecting stronger petrochemical and black oil products volumes  modest contract rate increases  and labor and producer price index escalators effective january  on numerous multi year contracts 
in addition  the year reflected the full first quarter impact of the january  purchase of the inland tank barge fleet of seariver 
petrochemical volumes transported were strong for all of  due primarily to the improved us and global economies 
contract customers operated their plants at high utilization rates throughout  resulting in high barge utilization for most products and trade lanes 
black oil volumes during were higher than  reflecting increased refinery production generating demand for waterborne transportation of heavier refinery residual oil by products 
in addition  the continued high natural gas prices during resulted in the continued use of residual fuel as a substitute for natural gas for the production of refined products 
refined products volumes transported into the midwest from the gulf coast during were generally at normal seasonal levels  with demand stronger in april through august  the typical summer driving season 
agricultural chemical volumes were weak throughout  with some improvement in the fourth quarter 
high midwest inventory levels and high product prices during the first six months caused volumes to be weak 
during the third quarter  despite low midwest inventory levels  volumes transported were reduced from levels as high prices for liquid fertilizer products curtailed demand 
the company incurred a record  delay days during  a increase over  delay days incurred in the delay days included the closure of a major lock for repair on the gulf intracoastal waterway in may and the closure of a major lock on the ohio river for repair in august 
the delay days also included high water conditions  principally during the second and fourth quarters  a significant number of fog days along the gulf coast in the first and fourth quarters  and hurricane ivan in september 
hurricane ivan  which made landfall near gulf shores  alabama on september   adversely affected the company s operations 
the initial projected path was from new orleans to the florida panhandle 
in anticipation of hurricane ivan  most petrochemical plants and refineries in the projected path closed 
additionally  the company moved equipment out of the projected path of the storm  disrupting the company s distribution systems and resulting in repositioning costs 
hurricane ivan s impact was an estimated 
per share  including the impact on the operations of the company s owned offshore partnership with a florida utility accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
during  approximately of marine transportation volumes were under term contracts and were spot market volumes 
contracts renewed during increased on average of to  primarily the result of stronger industry demand and higher utilization of tank barges 
depending on when the contract was priced  some contracts were increased by a higher percentage  while others were adjusted by a lower percentage 
effective january   escalators for labor and the producer price index on numerous multi year contracts increased term contract rates by approximately 
during  spot market rates were to higher for most product lines when compared with and were above contract rates 
marine transportation costs and expenses total costs and expenses for increased compared with  reflecting increased volumes noted above and the full year impact of the january  acquisition of the seariver fleet 
costs of sales and operating expenses for increased over the increase reflected wage increases and related expenses effective january   as well as additional expenses associated with the increased volumes transported 
during  the segment operated an average of inland towboats compared with an average of during the number of towboats operated and crews required fluctuates daily  depending on the volumes moved  weather conditions and voyage times 
the segment consumed million gallons of diesel fuel during compared with million gallons consumed in the average cost of diesel fuel continued to increase during for  the average price per gallon consumed was  a increase over average price of cents 
term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses that allow the company to recover increases in the cost of fuel  however  there is generally a to day delay before contracts are adjusted 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased compared with the increase reflected salary increases and related expenses  effective january   higher incentive compensation accruals  higher medical costs and increased professional and legal fees 
taxes  other than on income  for increased compared with the increase was primarily attributable to higher waterway use taxes from increased business activity levels and higher property taxes on new and existing inland tank barges and towboats 
depreciation and amortization for increased compared with the increase was attributable to new tank barges and increased capital expenditures in and marine transportation operating income and operating margins the marine transportation operating income for increased compared with the operating margin increased to for compared with for the higher operating margin for reflected improved volumes  the january  labor and producer price index escalators on numerous multi year contracts  the renewal of contracts with rate increases on average of and  and the to increase in spot market rates 
compared with marine transportation revenues revenues for compared with increased  reflecting revenues generated from the october acquisition of inland black oil tank barges and towboats from coastal and the signing of a barge management agreement to manage coastal s remaining black oil barges  of which are currently active 
revenues from the managed coastal tank barges were included in marine transportation revenues 
the increase also reflected revenues generated from the purchase of inland tank barges and seven towboats  and the assumption of leased inland tank barges from seariver in january petrochemical volumes transported into the midwest  excluding the seariver volumes  reflected a continued gradual improvement during when compared with during the second half of  volumes of petrochemicals used in the production of gasoline blending components were strong 
petrochemical volumes along the gulf coast  excluding the seariver volumes  also reflected a continued gradual improvement 
black oil volumes were higher than volume levels  reflecting the october coastal acquisition noted above 
during  volumes of residual fuel  a black oil product  increased as residual fuel served as a substitute for natural gas and cat cracker feedstock for the production of refined products  and offset a decline in asphalt volumes  which declined during due to a reduction in state and federal funding for road construction 
refined product volumes into the midwest for were generally at normal seasonal levels  slow in the first quarter  improving with seasonal demand in the second and third quarters and stronger than normal in the fourth quarter 
during the second and third quarters  low midwest inventory levels and gulf coast versus midwest gasoline price differentials encouraged the movements of gasoline from the gulf coast into the midwest 
the stronger than normal fourth quarter demand for gasoline movements was fueled by numerous midwest refinery outages for maintenance  as well as low midwest inventory levels 
liquid fertilizer volumes were weak for the first nine months of  as a depressed us midwest farm belt economy significantly curtailed the application of nitrogen based fertilizer  and high natural gas prices significantly curtailed the us production of such fertilizer  thereby reducing the demand for midwest volumes of such products by tank barge 
during the fourth quarter  liquid fertilizer volumes to the midwest strengthened as the midwest farm economy improved and imported products replaced curtailed us domestic production to meet the demand to replenish low midwest inventory levels 
during  approximately of marine transportation volumes were under term contracts and were spot market volumes 
contract rates on renewals remained relatively flat for the first nine months of  with limited ability to pass through inflationary cost increases in renewals 
during the fourth quarter  the modest improvement in the petrochemical and refined products markets resulted in some modest contract renewal increases 
the modestly stronger petrochemical and refined products markets also helped overall spot market rates 
during  spot market rates fluctuated over and under contracts rates  depending on market demand  fuel prices  weather conditions and other factors  however  on average  spot market rates were slightly higher than marine transportation costs and expenses total costs and expenses for increased compared with  reflecting the additional costs and expenses associated with operating additional tank barges and towboats purchased from coastal in october and the related barge management agreement signed with coastal  and the seariver fleet acquisition in january costs of sales and operating expenses for were higher than  reflecting additional vessel personnel and higher operating expenses from the acquisitions noted above 
the segment operated an average of towboats during the first quarter  during the second quarter  during the third quarter and during the fourth quarter 
the number of towboats operated and crews required fluctuates daily  depending on the volumes moved  weather conditions and voyage times 
the first quarter costs and expenses were higher due to navigational delays caused by periods of both high and low water levels on the mississippi river system  and fog and high winds along the gulf intracoastal waterway 
navigational delays also resulted from repairs to a major lock located on the gulf intracoastal waterway 
the navigational delays necessitated the use of additional chartered towboats during the first quarter and part of the second quarter  as noted above  to meet customer service requirements and schedules 
costs of sales and operating expenses for included significantly higher fuel costs when compared with the average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed in was cents  up from the average price per gallon of cents 
for the first quarter  the price per gallon was over the first quarter of  with the second  third and fourth quarters up  and  respectively  over the corresponding quarters of term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses that allow the company to recover increases in the cost of fuel  however  there is generally a to day delay before contracts are adjusted 
it is estimated that the higher fuel prices reduced the company s first quarter earnings by an estimated 
per share  of which approximately 
per share was recovered in the second quarter 
for the third and fourth quarters  the negative impact of the higher fuel costs was marginal 
for the year  the segment consumed million gallons of diesel fuel compared with million gallons consumed in the increase primarily reflected the acquisitions noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased when compared with the increase reflected higher incentive compensation accruals  professional fees  and additional administrative personnel to support the acquisitions noted above 
taxes  other than on income for increased compared with  primarily reflecting increased waterway use taxes and property taxes resulting from the acquisitions noted above 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased over the increase reflected new tank barge additions in and  as well as the acquisitions noted above 
marine transportation operating income and operating margins the marine transportation operating income for increased compared with the operating margin declined to compared with earned in the lower operating margin for reflected the segment s inability to pass through to its customers  through contract rate renewals and spot market rates  increases in its costs and expenses in excess of the inflation rate 
the lower operating margin for also reflected more severe winter weather conditions in the first quarter of compared with the first quarter  major repairs to a critical lock on the gulf intracoastal waterway and rapidly escalating fuel prices during the first quarter that were only partially recovered under contractual fuel escalation clauses in the second quarter 
the year also included a full year of revenue from the october  purchase of the coastal tank barges and towboats and barge management agreement between the company and coastal 
the company s management of the coastal tank barges is accounted for as an unincorporated joint venture  whereby all revenues and certain expenses of the managed tank barges are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the distribution of coastal s share of the joint venture s operating profits is recognized as an operating expense  which lowered the company s marine transportation operating margin by an estimated 
diesel engine services the company  through its diesel engine services segment  sells genuine replacement parts  provides service mechanics to overhaul and repair large medium speed and high speed diesel engines and reduction gears  and maintains facilities to rebuild component parts or entire large medium speed and high speed diesel engines  and entire reduction gears 
the segment services the marine  power generation and railroad markets 
the following table sets forth the company s diesel engine services segment s revenues  costs and expenses  operating income and operating margins for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to diesel engine services revenues costs and expenses costs of sales and operating expenses selling  general and administrative taxes  other than on income depreciation and amortization operating income operating margins compared with diesel engine services revenues diesel engine services revenues for were higher than and were positively impacted by the april purchase of the midwest diesel engine services operations of walker and increased demand for parts in all railroad markets  especially the transit railroad market 
the nuclear power generation market was strong in the second half of  enhanced with direct parts sales to a major customer 
the gulf coast offshore oil service market was weak for all of and the east coast and west coast marine markets were weak for the first nine months  but experienced some improvement in the fourth quarter 
diesel engine services costs and expenses costs and expenses for increased when compared with costs of sales and operating expenses increased  reflecting the increased revenue as noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were higher than  principally due to increases in salaries and related expenses and higher employee medical costs 
diesel engine services operating income and operating margins operating income for the diesel engine services segment for was higher than and the operating margin improved slightly to in compared with for both the improved operating income and operating margin reflected the stronger railroad and nuclear power generation markets 
compared with diesel engine services revenues revenues for reflected a decrease when compared with during  two of diesel engine services primary markets  the gulf coast offshore well service market and the midwest dry cargo barge market  remained weak 
these markets  as well as a weak east coast marine market  negatively impacted revenues  and were only partially offset by a stronger west coast marine market and nuclear power generation market 
diesel engine services costs and expenses cost of sales and operating expenses for decreased compared with  reflecting the lower service activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses were slightly higher in versus primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals and employee medical costs  partially offset during the second half of by employee reductions in the segment s midwest market 
diesel engine services operating income and operating margins operating income for the diesel engine services segment for was lower than  and the operating margin declined to compared with for the lower operating margin was primarily attributable to an increase in parts sales and lower service revenue 
during  service revenue represented of total revenue compared with for  while parts revenue represented of total revenue compared with in parts sales generally earn a lower operating margin than service work 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses for  and were   and  respectively 
the increase in compared with reflects increases in salaries and related expenses effective january   higher employee incentive compensation accruals  higher employee medical costs  increased legal and professional fees  and the costs of evaluating and implementing new accounting and governmental regulations  including the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in compared with was primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation accruals and professional fees 
other income and expenses the following table sets forth the impairment of long lived assets  gain loss on disposition of assets  equity in earnings of marine affiliates  impairment of equity investment  other expense  minority interests and interest expense for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to impairment of long lived assets  n a gain loss on disposition of assets equity in earnings of marine affiliates impairment of equity investment  n a other expense minority interests interest expense asset impairments during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded  of non cash pre tax impairment charges 
the after tax effect of the charges was  or 
per share 
of the total pre tax charges   was due to reduced estimated cash flows resulting from reduced lives on the company s single hull fleet and its commitment to sell certain vessels 
the reduced estimated useful lives on single hull tank barges was due to market bias against single hull tank barges and the assessment of the impact of new regulations issued in september by the uscg that require the installation of tank level monitoring devices on all single hull tank barges by october the company plans to retire all of its single hull tank barges by october  the company committed to sell inactive or out of service double hull tank barges and five inactive towboats and reduced the carrying value of these vessels by  to fair value of  the charges also included a  write down of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate to its estimated fair value and a  write down of surplus diesel shop equipment 
gain loss on disposition of assets the company reported a net loss on disposition of assets of  in and  in compared with a net gain of  in the net losses and gain were predominantly from the sale of marine equipment 
equity in earnings of marine affiliates equity in earnings of marine affiliates  consisting primarily of a owned offshore marine partnership  decreased to  in  a decrease compared with for  equity in earnings increased to  a increase compared with during  and  the four offshore dry cargo barge and tugboats units owned through the owned partnership with a public utility were generally employed under the partnership s contract to transport coal across the gulf of mexico  with a separate contract for the backhaul of limestone rock 
hurricanes ivan  francis and jeanne  during august and september  negatively impacted the company s year  resulting in fewer work days for the four partnership barge and tug units during the third quarter 
equity in earnings of marine affiliates was also negatively impacted in by the sale of the company s interest in a shreveport  louisiana liquid products terminal  resulting in a  pre tax loss on the sale 
the significant improvement in equity in earnings for over reflected close to full utilization of the partnership s fleet 
the lower results for primarily reflected reduced rates on the renewed coal transportation contract  and the timing of maintenance on three of the four units in the partnership 
interest expense interest expense for decreased compared with  primarily attributable to lower average debt levels 
the increase in interest expense for compared with reflected higher average debt  offset to some degree by lower average interest rates 
the higher average debt level was attributable to the coastal acquisition in october  the union carbide acquisition in december  the seariver acquisition in january and higher capital expenditures levels  partially offset by higher cash flow from operating activities 
during  and  the average debt and average interest rate  including the effect of interest rate swaps  were  and   and  and  and  respectively 
financial condition  capital resources and liquidity balance sheet total assets as of december  were  compared with  as of december  and  as of december  the following table sets forth the significant components of the balance sheet as of december  compared with and compared with dollars in thousands change change to to assets current assets property and equipment  net investment in marine affiliates goodwill  net other assets liabilities and stockholders equity current liabilities long term debt less current portion deferred income taxes minority interests and other long term liabilities stockholders equity compared with current assets as of december  increased compared with december  trade accounts receivable increased  primarily reflecting the stronger marine transportation volumes and resulting higher revenues in the fourth quarter of over the fourth quarter of the decrease in other accounts receivable reflected a reduction in a receivable from the internal revenue service of  inventory finished goods increased and primarily reflected inventory purchased in the walker acquisition 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased  reflecting an increase in prepaid fuel inventory due to the higher price of fuel  and an increase in current portion of pension assets  partially offset by the sale of certain assets held for sale during the company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by  primarily in the marine transportation segment 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  at december  increased compared with december  the increase reflected  of capital expenditures  more fully described under capital expenditures below   for the purchase of three pre owned tank barges and the remaining interest in a liquid products terminal  and  of property with the walker acquisition  less  of depreciation expense and property write downs and disposals of  during investment in marine affiliates at december  increased compared with december  the increase reflected the  purchase of a one third interest in osprey in april  equity in earnings of marine affiliates of  including a loss of  from the sale of the company s interest in a liquid products terminal recorded in september  less  of distributions received during other assets as of december  decreased compared with december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the amortization of the long term prepaid pension asset and the early payoff of two notes receivable from prior year marine equipment sales  partially offset by the pension plan contribution of  goodwill net as of december  increased compared with december   reflecting goodwill recorded in the walker acquisition
