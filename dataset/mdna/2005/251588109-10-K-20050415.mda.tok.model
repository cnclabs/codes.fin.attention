table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is an analysis of the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  consistently applied 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies and estimates most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for credit losses  inventories and loss reserve for inventories  cost to complete construction contracts  assets held for sale  intangible assets  income taxes  taxes on un repatriated earnings  warranty obligations  impairment charges  restructuring  business divestitures  pensions  deferral compensation and other employee benefit plans or arrangements  environmental matters  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs  for which collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue relating to claims only when there exists a legal basis supported by objective and verifiable evidence and additional identifiable costs are incurred due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the company s control 
change orders for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that they will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
notes receivable are recorded at cost  less a related allowance for impaired notes receivable 
management  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers ability to repay their obligations  considers a note to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note s effective interest rate 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to bad debt expense 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
change orders for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that they will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
we estimate costs to complete 
table of contents our construction contracts based on experience from similar work in the past 
if the conditions of the work to be performed change or if the estimated costs are not accurately projected  the gross profit from construction contracts may vary significantly in the future 
the foregoing  as well as weather  stage of completion and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from management s review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
we consider the age of specific accounts  a customer s payment history and specific collateral given by the customer to secure the receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
if the customers pay a previously impaired receivable  income is then recognized 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability arising from the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assessments about current and future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
if the actual market demand surpasses the projected levels  inventory write downs are not reserved 
we maintain an accrual for retirement agreements with company executives and certain other employees 
this accrual is based on the life expectancy of these persons and an assumed weighted average discount rate of 
should the actual longevity vary significantly from the united states insurance norms  or should the discount rate used to establish the present value of the obligation vary  the accrual may have to be significantly increased or diminished at that time 
based on a written legal opinion from antiguan counsel  we did not record a contingent liability of million  excluding any interest or penalties  for taxes assessed by the government of antigua and barbuda for the years through in december  the company entered into an agreement with antigua settling certain obligations 
pursuant to this agreement  these assessments were deemed paid 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the edc completed a compliance review on one of our subsidiaries in the us virgin islands on february  the compliance review covered the period from april  through march  and resulted from the company s application to request an extension of tax exemptions from the edc 
the company is working with the edc to resolve the issues raised 
one of those issues is whether certain items of income qualified for exemption benefits under the company s then existing tax exemption  including notice of failure to make gross receipts tax payments of  and income taxes of million  not including interest and penalties 
this is the first time that a position contrary to the company s or any position on this specific issue has been raised by the edc 
in light of these recent events  and based on discussions with legal counsel  the company established a tax accrual at december  for such exposure which approximates the amounts set forth in the edc notice 
in september  the statute of limitations with respect to the income tax return filed by the company for the year ended december   expired 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  the company 
table of contents reversed million of the tax accrual established at december  the company continues to work with the edc regarding this matter and if challenged by the us virgin islands taxing authority  would vigorously contest its position 
we were accounting for the notes receivable from the government of antigua and barbuda under the cost recovery method until april subsequent to a restructuring of the notes  we started to account for the notes using the accrual method 
we recorded payments received  first to the projected principal reductions for the period  then to accrued interest  and lastly to additional reduction of principal 
interest income was recognized on the notes only to the extent payments were received for accrued interest 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the debt owed by antigua under the notes receivable was satisfied pursuant to an agreement settling these obligations 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
we determine our fixed assets recoverability on a subsidiary level or group of asset level 
if we  as a result of our valuation in the future  assess the assets not to be recoverable  a negative adjustment to the book value of those assets may occur 
on the other hand  if we impair an asset  and the asset continues to produce income  we may record earnings higher than they should have been if no impairment had been recorded 
we determine goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
some of these assets we determine to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb this testing is based on subjective analysis and may change from time to time 
the company will test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as of june  and annually thereafter 
other identifiable intangible assets with estimatable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
the review of impairment and estimation of useful life is subjective and may change from time to time 
we are not presently considering changes to any of our critical accounting policies and we do not presently believe that any of our critical accounting policies are reasonably likely to change in the near future 
there have not been any material changes to the methodology used in calculating our estimates during the last three years 
the ceo  cfo and the audit committee have reviewed all of the foregoing critical accounting policies and estimates

there is no grandfathering of existing entities 
public companies must apply either fin or fin r immediately to entities created after january  and no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations

table of contents comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  summary in  our consolidated revenue amounted to million  an increase of million or approximately a increase compared to s revenue of million 
this revenue increase was principally due an increase in revenue recorded by our construction and materials divisions 
the company s operating loss decreased million to million when compared to s operating loss of million 
this significant improvement was principally a result of our construction and materials divisions achieving a combined increase in gross margin of million in addition to a reduction of million in depreciation expense 
these improvements were reduced by an increase in operating expenses totaling million 
other income increased million  principally due to the settlement of an outstanding note receivable and various pending claims with the government of antigua and barbuda 
net income for increased by million to million when compared to s net loss of million 
this increase is mainly due to the items set out above in addition to a million decrease in income tax expense in  as compared to the million income tax expense we recorded in the income tax expense reduction is principally due to a reversal of a prior year s accrual relating to tax matters with respect to our us virgin islands operations  as well as an increase in our deferred tax assets 
total revenue in our consolidated revenue amounted to million  an increase of million  or  approximately  a increase when compared to s revenue of million 
this revenue increase was principally due to an increase in revenue recorded by our construction and materials divisions 
our construction business revenues increased by million to million when compared to million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity in the bahamas and the us virgin islands 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was approximately million  involving projects  as compared to approximately million involving projects at december  our backlog on exuma  in the bahamas  at december   was approximately million 
from december  through march   we entered into nine new construction contracts in the caribbean  which revenue when recognized will amount to approximately million 
our materials business revenue increased by million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in sand and aggregate sales of million 
concrete and block revenue increased and  respectively  mainly due to increased demand in st 
croix 
aggregates revenue increased by  mainly due to an increase in demand in all locations except antigua 

table of contents cost of construction cost of construction decreased to of construction revenue in from in this decrease is primarily attributable to the increased volume in the bahamas construction subsidiary and also to the varying profitability levels of individual contracts and the stage of completion of such contracts 
cost of materials cost of materials decreased to of materials revenue from in this decrease was primarily the result of improved margins in st 
croix 
notwithstanding increased revenues in all our materials operations except antigua  margins were impacted during due to tight supplies of cement throughout our operations 
this supply condition resulted in higher than expected raw materials cost at all our ready mix operations 
in addition  severe weather conditions brought on by several hurricanes which moved through the caribbean during september resulted in supply delays and other inefficiencies in our materials business during the fourth quarter of margins were also affected by unfavorable inventory variances recorded in the fourth quarter of operating expenses total operating expenses  including unallocated corporate charges  increased by to million in from million in operating expenses reported in included a million impairment expense with respect to certain long lived assets in our materials division compared to an expense amounting to million in the comparable increase in operating expense amounts to approximately million 
our construction division s operating expense increased million to million compared to million in this increase is due to additional overhead necessary as a result of the million revenue increase reported by our construction division during our materials division operating expense decreased million to million compared to million in the materials division s operating expense in included a million impairment expense with respect to certain long lived assets  which expense compared to million in  therefore  the comparable increase in operating expense amounts to million 
the increase in operating expense is principally the result of approximately million of bad debt expense and million of retirement and severance expense incurred by our sint marteen and antigua operations 
our corporate and unallocated operating expense increased million to million in compared to million in this increase is attributable to an million non cash expense associated with the issuance of certain common stock warrants  and an million increase in salaries and related benefits associated with adding the personnel necessary to execute our entry into the electronic security services sector  as well as to address the expected growth in our construction division 
in addition  we incurred an increase of million in legal and audit fees in 
table of contents operating loss income the company s operating loss decreased million to million when compared to s operating loss of million 
this significant improvement was principally a result of our construction and materials divisions achieving a combined increase in gross margin of million  in addition to a reduction of million in depreciation expense 
these improvements were reduced by an increase in total operating expenses totaling million 
our construction division s operating income increased million to million from million in this increase was a result of revenues increasing by million to million when compared to million during this increase resulted primarily from increased activity in the bahamas and the us virgin islands 
we currently expect to experience continued revenue growth accompanied by a corresponding increase in aggregate gross margin dollars  however  due to the mix of projects currently being worked accompanied by pending bids outstanding  we anticipate that our gross margin as a percentage of revenue may experience a minor decline in the materials operating losses decreased during the year  from million in to million in  however  this division did record an operating loss of million in the fourth quarter of  compared to an operating loss of million during the comparable quarter of operating results during the fourth quarter of were significantly affected by negative inventory variations  a million asset impairment and a million increase in bad debt expense relating to certain trade and notes receivable  and million of retirement and severance expense 
these expenses are principally attributable to our sint marteen and anitgua operations 
we have begun the process of implementing additional review procedures and financial controls in an attempt to prevent these type of write downs from being required in the future 
in addition  we are in the process of reviewing each of our material operations in detail and  based upon our findings  we will implement the necessary changes to improve profitability which we anticipate will be achieved through a combination of price increases  where appropriate  and operating expense reductions 
in addition  based upon the final outcome of our review  we may choose to pursue an orderly divestment of all of or certain segments of our materials operations 
other income other income increased million to million when compared to million in this increase was principally due to the settlement of an outstanding note receivable and various pending claims with the government of antigua and barbuda  which resulted in a gain of million 
during and  the government of antigua did not meet all of its payment obligations to the company 
however  on december   antigua masonry products  limited and antigua heavy constructors  limited collectively amp  direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company  entered into an agreement for satisfaction of indebtedness and amendment no 
to st 
john s dredging and deep water pier construction the satisfaction agreement with the government of antigua and barbuda antigua 
pursuant to the terms of the satisfaction agreement  amp and antigua agreed to a settlement in which approximately 
table of contents million in debt owed by antigua to those companies was deemed satisfied in exchange for certain cash payments made to those companies by antigua  as well as the remittance of all outstanding tax assessments and other relief from current and future taxes and duties 
the company at the time of settlement had a recorded book value of approximately million for the notes 
as a result of this satisfaction agreement and in exchange for the cancellation of the outstanding debt owed to amp by antigua  amp received million in cash  a commitment for an additional  cash which has been received during the first quarter of  a million credit toward future withholding taxes incurred by amp or the company  plus remittance of all taxes and duties incurred through december  the company has only recognized million of the future withholding and income tax benefit based on the current plans for repatriation of foreign earnings 
the satisfaction agreement also settles the litigation over a million assessment issued with respect to the company s subsidiaries in antigua 
income tax expense income tax expense decreased by million in to million when compared to million in the income tax expense reduction is principally due to a reversal of a prior year s accrual of million relating to tax matters with respect to our us virgin islands operations  an increase of million in our deferred tax assets and favorable rate differentials enjoyed by certain of our offshore operations 
these increases were offset by a million increase in deferred tax liability as a result of receiving a dividend from a foreign subsidiary in january based upon the company electing a dividend reinvestment plan in accordance with the american jobs creation act we expect that the company will receive a tax benefit of approximately million in january the us virgin islands economic development commission edc granted us tax exemptions on most of our us virgin islands earnings through march we have applied for an extension of this tax exemption  however  there is no guarantee that it will be granted 
if the application is denied  the company s income  gross receipts  and property taxes would increase significantly 
these increases would be partially offset by decreases in the company s compliance expenses and losses incurred in order to satisfy certain conditions of the edc tax exemptions 
the edc completed a compliance review on our subsidiary in the us virgin islands on february  the compliance review covered the period from april through march  and resulted from the company s application to request an extension of tax exemptions from the edc 
the company received a notice of failure to make gross receipts tax payments of  and income tax payments of million  not including interest and penalties 
this is the first time that a position contrary to the company s or any position on this specific issue has been raised by the edc 
in light of these events  and based on discussions with legal counsel  the company established a tax accrual at december  for such exposure which approximated the amounts set forth in the edc notice 
in september  the statute of limitations with respect to the income tax return filed by the company for the year ended december   expired 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  the company reversed million of the tax accrual established at december  the company continues to work with the edc regarding this matter and  if challenged by the us virgin islands taxing authority  will vigorously contest this interpretation 

table of contents the company has been accruing  based on the advice of counsel  not remitting  gross receipts taxes  which would be due should the company s application for extension of benefit be withdrawn or denied 
the company has been further advised by counsel that  should the application of benefits be denied  the internal revenue bureau would  most likely  waive any penalties for late payment of gross receipts taxes through the date of denial  although no assurance can be given that such waiver would be granted 
comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  total revenue our revenue was million in and million in this increase reflects an increase in construction revenue and a smaller increase in materials revenue 
revenue from our construction operation increased to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity on antigua and aruba 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was approximately million involving projects  as compared to approximately million involving six projects at december  from december  through february   we entered into some additional construction contracts 
we are currently in final negotiations for several contracts and we expect the division to increase its volume in we expect the current backlog to be completed during our materials revenue increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in the sale of concrete  block and cement  offset to a lesser extent by a reduced sale of aggregates 
concrete and block revenue increased and  respectively  mainly due to increased volumes on st 
martin  primarily due to a significant project on the island 
aggregates sales decreased in st 
croix by and on puerto rico by 
this reduction was due to reduced activity  as well as heavy rains in the th quarter of we are not sure that the concrete volume increases on st 
martin will be sustainable  however  we believe that aggregates volumes will increase during the next two quarters 
we also anticipate that aggregates volumes on st 
croix and puerto rico will increase during at this time we cannot predict total materials revenue in cost of construction cost of construction decreased to of construction revenue in from in this decrease is primarily attributable to the marine equipment unit having profitable work at the end of and being able to obtain more profitable construction contracts during  and also to the varying profitability levels of individual contracts and the stage of completion of such contracts 
cost of materials cost of materials increased to of materials revenue from in this increase was primarily the result of reduced margins in the us virgin islands from the sale of lower margin products and lower volumes  and reduced margins on puerto rico  due to lower volumes and high fixed costs 
the margins on st 
martin improved during the year  but are not satisfactory 
we have been able to secure new sales agreements 
with improved volumes  we believe that the profitability should improve 

table of contents operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense for the materials operations increased by to million in from million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to  in accelerated depreciation of assets in st 
thomas and antigua and  of increased consulting fees  including an expense of  related to the water desalination business 
we also had an increase in property and other taxes of  offset by reduced insurance expense of  and reduced labor and labor related expenses of  as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased to during as compared to during the previous year 
due to lower profitability and lower volumes affecting certain assets  management upon its review in the first quarter of long lived assets  determined that impairment had occurred to some of our assets 
an impairment expense of million was recognized in compared to  in the company has two batch plants on antigua and  during the second quarter  consolidated its operations to the main facility 
accordingly  the installation cost of the plant that was moved has been fully depreciated and the original plant at the main facility that will be functioning as a spare plant had its book value depreciated through accelerated depreciation to its estimated fair value 
the depreciation expense recorded in the second quarter was approximately  in the first quarter of  the company recorded an impairment expense of million 
this consisted of the following items st 
martin crusher concrete operations sint maarten block plant aguadilla crusher plant other assets total the st 
martin sint maarten operations were determined to be impaired due to continuing losses 
the company could not project sufficient future earnings to cover the long lived assets 
an impairment charge of  was recorded to write down the st 
martin crusher and concrete plant to their estimated fair value  using an estimated probable sales price as the determinant of the value 
management is reviewing its alternatives and has not yet made a decision about future operational changes 
the sint maarten concrete and aggregate sales operations have an estimated fair value in excess of recorded long lived assets  and therefore no impairment was recorded for this part of the business 
the sint maarten block plant was impaired and an operational decision has been made to close the plant and dismantle it 
the company is currently importing part of its need for blocks from devcon plants on other islands 
the plant in aguadilla  puerto rico is leased to a third party whose extraction permit was cancelled in february of this year 
on april  the lessee asked for a moratorium on payments  at the same time as he gave notice of the extraction permit being cancelled 
as a result of these 
table of contents actions  management s expectation of future cash flows and the fact that the only source of revenue for the plant has come from the lessee  the company recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the plant to its estimated fair value 
on september   the third party received its extraction permit and has started aggregates processing operations 
during the year the company incurred additional retirement and severance expense due the retirement of several executives of the company  termination of truck and equipment operators  as well as a reduction in the interest rate used in the net present value calculation of the obligations 
the total expense for was million  as compared to million in the company has taken measures to diminish said retirement cost in the future  nevertheless  the retirement expense can vary in the future due to fluctuations in the interest rate to discount future obligations to present value 
future severance cost can be affected by strategic initiatives of the company  and should be offset by future savings 
the k savings plan matching in the us has been slightly increased so that additional retirement costs will not be necessary when an employee retires from the company 
currently  a senior executive intends to retire at the end of the total cost for his retirement agreement  which was finalized in december  will be approximately  during the fourth quarter  we recorded  of expense for past services and the balance of approximately  will be recorded over his remaining service time in operating loss income we had an operating loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in our construction division had an operating loss of  in compared to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the marine operation s having some profitable work in and being idle in we also had improved margins on certain contracts during the current backlog is the same as at the end of  however  we believe we can achieve success in our current negotiations and bids for new contracts 
we believe that we will see continuing improved results for the division in our materials business had an operating loss of million in  compared to an operating profit of  in this million decrease in operating profit is mainly due to a million impairment of long lived assets in st 
martin and puerto rico   of accelerated depreciation in st 
thomas and antigua and million lower gross margins on sales 
the lower gross margin resulted primarily from the quarry operations 
we had unusually heavy rains on most islands we operate in the fourth quarter of this resulted in reduced volumes in st 
croix and puerto rico and the gross margins were reduced by million and  respectively 
the change in product mix on st 
thomas resulted in a lower average selling price  even though costs remained basically the same 
st 
thomas also suffered from production problems in its block plant  which had a material adverse effect on margins 
accordingly  the gross margin in st 
thomas was reduced by  operations volumes increased in sint maarten st 
martin  which resulted in an  increase in gross margin 
sg a expense was slightly reduced for the division 
in addition to a million gain on the sale of our operations in dominica was reported in 
table of contents at the time of the sale of the operations in dominica in  the company entered into a profit and loss participation agreement that expired on march  during this time the gain on the sale of the operations was deferred 
at march   the company recognized a gain on sale of business of million 
other income we realized joint venture equity earnings of  primarily from a sale of a parcel of land in south florida 
gain on sale of equipment was  in  compared to  for the previous year 
our interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to reduced interest rates 
our interest income was million in  a reduction from million compared to the previous year 
interest recognized on notes receivable due from the government of antigua and barbuda decreased in by million  while interest received on outstanding accounts receivable increased 
the gain on joint venture equity is derived primarily from a sale of a lot in a south florida joint venture in income tax expense income tax expense increased to million in from  in during  the company recognized a tax exposure accrual related to the compliance notice received from the edc in the us virgin islands where it mentions the company s failure to make gross receipts tax payments of  and income taxes of  not including interest and penalties 
we believe we have valid defenses to the notice and intend to vigorously challenge the notice 
our tax rate varies depending on the level of our earnings in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate  the tax loss carry forwards and tax exemptions available to us 
the effective tax rate was negative in as compared to in the company is currently appealing tax assessments in antigua for million  as has been previously discussed

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the construction business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
in the construction division  our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our construction services 
during  we financed  million  and the outstanding balance of the financed construction contracts as of december  was million  all of which is due to be paid at different times within the next three years 
accounts receivable for the materials operation are typically established with terms between and days 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs 
management believes our cash flow from operations  existing working capital and funds available from lines of credit are adequate to meet our needs during the next months 
historically  we have used a number of lenders to finance a portion of our machinery and equipment purchases 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding to these lenders 
management believes it has significant collateral and financial stability to be able to obtain significant financing  should it be required  though no assurances can be made 
as of december   our liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and available lines of credit of million 
total outstanding liabilities were million as of december   compared to million a year earlier

we have a million unsecured overdraft facility from a commercial bank in the united states 
the facility is due on demand and bears interest at a rate variable with libor 
the bank can demand repayment of the loan and cancellation of the overdraft facility  if certain financial or other covenants are in default
