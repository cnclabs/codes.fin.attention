this increase in other income was offset by a charge of  related to the fair value mark to market charge associated with outstanding warrants issued as part of a private placement of common stock in may of during fiscal  this mark to market adjustment resulted in  in expense 
the company reported pre tax income of  in fiscal as compared to a pre tax income of  in the previous fiscal year primarily due to the increased revenues and expense reductions noted above

this increase is primarily attributable to the sale of nine more mobilesearch systems in fiscal than in fiscal  the sale of the company s first four zbv s offset by the completion of significant fixed site systems in the current year that had been ongoing in fiscal in contrast  parcelsearch sales decreased by  to  primarily due to the continuation of the lower revenue levels experienced in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal as demand leveled off after the first and second quarter of fiscal  which had increased demand following september th 
services revenues increased by to  as compared to  in fiscal primarily due to new post warranty service contracts on installed machines 
the company recorded  in contract research and development revenues in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the company s hes division increased revenues by  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal primarily due to increased demand from one major customer 
the geographical mix of revenues in fiscal remained fairly constant at domestic revenues as compared to domestic revenues in fiscal in fiscal year  the company had sales to two major customers which accounted for and  respectively  of total sales 
in fiscal year  the company had sales to one major customer  which accounted for of total sales 
cost of sales and contracts of  in fiscal increased by  or from the previous year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the revenue increase noted above and the recognition of a  loss on a contract for a first time build of a system which experienced unanticipated technical challenges 
these increases in cost of sales were offset by the sales of higher margin mobilesearch units sold and improved service margins as the company entered into several large service contracts in the current fiscal year as warranties expired and the replacement of certain unprofitable service contracts and time and material service arrangements 
included in cost of sales and contracts in fiscal was a  provision for inventory obsolescence 
no material amounts of inventory reserved were subsequently sold after this provision was established 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  were  less than the previous year and represented of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this reduction from the prior year relates to lower consulting costs and reduced demo related expenditures 
in fiscal  the company had an expanded demonstration tour with a mobilesearch system that was not repeated in the current year 
these decreases were offset somewhat by the addition of sales and marketing personnel in the current year as well as severance and other costs incurred related to the termination of the company s chief executive officer 
company funded research and development spending decreased to  in fiscal  a decrease compared to the  spent in fiscal research and development spending was of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  the company continued to work to control its research and development spending while continuing to focus on specific initiatives such as the shaped energy gantry system  which was completed in fiscal  and the z backscatter van  which had its first four unit shipments in the current year  and radiation threat detection technology 
other income expense was  in expense in fiscal as compared to  in income in fiscal in may of  the company closed on a private placement offering of common stock and warrants 
a total of  shares were sold to accredited investors at a price of each 
in addition  warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of were issued

in addition  there was a  increase in finished goods inventory from fiscal as certain units pending shipment or shipped fob destination were in inventory at period end 
the increase in accounts receivable of  from the prior year was due primarily to two customers who had combined receivables of  at fiscal year end 
in april   of these outstanding receivables was received upon resolution of certain billing documentation issues  with the remaining amount expected to be paid in the normal course of business 
the decrease in unbilled costs and fees of  was due to milestones billed and collected during fiscal the increase in customer deposits of  was due to milestones received on one large percentage of completion contract as well as deposits received on certain z backscatter system orders 
the increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities reflects an increase in the incentive compensation accruals of approximately  and the increase in the warranty accrual of  attributable to the increase in z backscatter van shipments during the current fiscal year 
net cash of  was used for investing activities in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures totaled  versus  for fiscal investments in fixed assets were comprised primarily of information technology  leasehold improvements  and furniture and fixtures 
the company invested  in short term investments during the year  and had maturities of  on short term investments 
the company received  in cash proceeds from the sale of certain assets of the company s high energy systems division 
net cash provided by financing activities was  cash was provided primarily by proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and the exercise of warrants held by outside investors 
restricted cash decreased by  from the prior year as certain stand by letters of credit collateralized by cash expired during the year 
on november   the company modified its two credit agreements with silicon valley bank east 
the modifications extended the credit facilities  which expired on november   to november  and reduced the export loan and security facility  guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states  from million to million 
the domestic facility is a million domestic loan and security agreement to support the company s routine working capital needs 
maximum borrowings for this facility are set at the lower of a the sum of of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus of finished goods inventory up to  or  b million 
the credit facilities bear an interest rate of the greater of or the silicon valley bank prime rate at march  
the credit agreements are collateralized by certain assets of the company and contain certain restrictions  including limitations on the amount of distributions that can be made to stockholders  and the disposition or encumbrances of assets  and require the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
as of march   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
at march   there were no borrowings outstanding against these credit facilities 
the company had outstanding  in stand by letters of credit against the domestic facility related to its building lease and  in stand by letters of credit against the export facility guaranteeing performance on an international project 
no amounts have been drawn against these letters of credit 
in addition at march   the company had a restricted cash balance of  related to certain bank required deposits related to outstanding letters of credits  bid bonds  and other bank related fees 
in recent years  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures with cash generated by operations  including deposits from customers on long term projects  from proceeds received from stock issuances and option exercises  and from lines of credit available to the company 
the company currently has no debt outstanding and believes that its cash flows from operations  cash and investments on hand and outstanding lines of credit are sufficient to meet the current and foreseeable operating requirements of the company s business 
contractual obligations the company leases various office equipment and manufacturing facilities under non cancelable operating leases 
in addition  in the normal course of business  the company enters into purchase orders with its vendors for the purchase of materials or services to meet its production needs 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of march  total less than year years years after years recorded contractual obligations other long term obligations unrecorded contractual obligations operating leases      purchase commitments   total      inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operation 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventories  allowances for obsolete and excess inventory  warrant liability  and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition the company derives a portion of its revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost and scope of each contract 
the company s fixed site cargosearch systems are sold under fixed price arrangements 
revenue is recognized using percentage of completion accounting  generally using the company s best estimate of total costs to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates reflected in the period identified 
the company recognizes certain other cargosearch system sales and other product revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  modified by emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in those instances where the company enters into agreements involving multiple revenue elements  the agreement is divided into separate elements of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to these elements based on fair value  and revenue recognition is considered separately for each individual element 
the company recognizes field service revenues as services are performed and generally recognizes revenues under maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the contract period which reasonably approximates the period under which the services are rendered 
revenues received in advance of services being rendered are deferred until such services have been provided 
the company s products are generally covered by a warranty for a one year period 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and management s expectations of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories consist of material  labor and manufacturing overhead and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
excessive manufacturing overhead costs such as idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage attributable to abnormally low volumes levels that materially differ from budgeted production plans due primarily to changes in customer demand are excluded from inventory and recorded as an expense in the period incurred 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand over the next twelve to eighteen months 
demand for products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in inventory balances while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  inventory reserves require estimates of future product demand which may materially impact the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory were determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
warrant liability in fiscal  the company issued  warrants in connection with a private placement offering of common stock 
as of march    of these warrants remain outstanding 
these warrants can be exchanged for cash under certain circumstances including a merger  sale or tender offer of the company and as such the company recorded the fair value of these warrants as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
the fair value of these warrants is adjusted each period with the resulting gain or loss recorded as other income expense in the statement of operations 
the black scholes method is used to value the warrants and the calculation requires the use of estimates for stock price volatility and interest rates 
the black scholes value of these warrants can fluctuate significantly based on the current fair market value of the company s common stock  changes in interest rates or changes in the volatility of the company s stock price 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  the company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at year end based upon its three year cumulative income and its projections of future income and records a valuation allowance against any net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends financial accounting standard no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r generally requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires the fair value on the grant date to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
the resulting cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in april  the sec deferred the effective date for sfas r to the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after june  the company expects to adopt sfas r on the effective date  and expects the adoption to have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  inventory costs  which amends part of arb  inventory pricing  concerning the treatment of certain types of inventory costs 
the provisions of arb no 
provided that certain inventory related costs  such as double freight and re handling  might be so abnormal that they should be charged against current earnings rather than be included in the cost of inventory 
as amended by sfas no 
 the so abnormal criterion has been eliminated 
thus  all such abnormal costs are required to be treated as current period charges under all circumstances 
in addition  fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of the production facilities  with unallocated overhead charged to expense when incurred 
sfas is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp application of fasb to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the new act provides for a special tax deduction on qualified production activities income that effectively reduces the company s tax rate 
the fasb has decided that these amounts should be recorded as a special deduction  and recorded in the year earned 
the adoption of this fsp statement will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
forward looking information and factors affecting future performance some of the statements contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference are forward looking statements  within the meaning of the federal securities laws  about our business and prospects 
our future results may differ materially from our past results and from those projected in the forward looking statements due to various uncertainties and risks including but not limited to those set forth below  one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements contained herein after the date of this annual report 
the company s reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues could harm its business and prospects 
the company s business is heavily dependent on sales to a small number of customers  which include agencies of the united states government 
during fiscal  three customers accounted for of the company s total revenues 
during fiscal  four customers accounted for of the company s total revenues and during fiscal  four customers accounted for of the company s total revenues 
during fiscal and  the company s largest customers  agencies of the us government  accounted for approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
certain of the company s government contracts may be terminated at the government s discretion 
the termination of the company s relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the company s revenues and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company conducts its business worldwide  which exposes it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
the company s revenues to international customers  including foreign governments  accounted for approximately  and of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   respectively and a significant number of domestic customer orders require shipments to  and services provided in  overseas locations 
in addition  the company transacts business internationally with a number of its key suppliers 
as a result of the company s worldwide business operations  it is subject to various risks  including international regulatory requirements and policy changes  lengthy sales cycles  longer payment cycles by foreign customers  difficulties in inventory management  accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  geopolitical instability  political and economic changes and disruptions  favoritism towards local suppliers  governmental currency controls  interruption to transportation flow for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and tariff regulations although the company s international sales have been denominated primarily in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the us dollar may make it more difficult for the company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results 
the company s lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that it will generate revenue or recover such expenses 
a substantial portion of the company s sales depends upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites  existing airports  seaports and other facilities 
accordingly  a portion of the company s product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  the company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if the company fails to receive an order after expending these resources  it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company s business is dependent upon governmental policies and appropriations 
the company s largest customers are government agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives 
these priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment 
the company is also exposed to the united states budget approval and appropriation cycle  which may be subject to significant and unpredictable delays 
if demand for the company s products is reduced because of a change in economic or political conditions or if there are delays in receiving governmental approvals and appropriations  sales of the company s products may be adversely affected and its business and prospects may be harmed 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for the company s products or increase its expenses 
the company competes in markets in which the company or its customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as health and safety regulations 
the company develops  configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the company s products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations  both of which may adversely affect its operating results 
the company s reliance on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products could harm its business and prospects 
the company relies on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products 
the company s reliance on limited supply sources reduces its control over timely delivery  price increases  reliability  and quality of critical components 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these key components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to the company on reasonable terms  if at all 
if the company changes any of its suppliers  the potential new supplier would be required to go through a qualification process  creating potential delays or reductions in product shipments 
the failure of any supplier to provide quality and timely components at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could result in lost or deferred sales  which would harm the company s business and prospects 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to fluctuate 
given the nature of the markets in which the company participates  it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
a high proportion of the company s costs are fixed  due in part to its significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
as a result of its fixed costs  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the company s operating results and stock price in a quarter 
factors that may affect the company s quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include demand for and market acceptance of its x ray inspection systems  lengthy sales cycles and the effect of large orders  changes in political agendas or national priorities  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the company does business  political unrest in the regions where the company transacts business  adverse changes in industries on which the company is particularly dependent  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices for its products  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the company s competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  variations in the company s product mix  the timing and amount of the company s expenditures in anticipation of future sales  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
the company could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims and adverse publicity if its x ray inspection systems fail to detect bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
if the company s x ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety  the company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity  which could result in increased costs  reduced sales  and a decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
there are many factors beyond the company s control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment 
the failure of the company s systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury  loss of life  and extensive property damage and resulting in potential claims against the company 
the company s insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
the company s product liability and umbrella liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
moreover  there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the company at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if liability claims exceed the company s current or available insurance coverage  its business and prospects may be harmed 
regardless of the adequacy of the company s product liability insurance protection  any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation  leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues 
the company may not be able to fund its research and development activities 
the company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations  private sources and the government 
the company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations  other potential private sources  or the government 
the company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources 
additionally  government funding priorities are subject to frequent changes 
for example  in fiscal and  the company recorded  and  respectively  for government sponsored research and development 
there is no guarantee that the company will receive funds for government sponsored research in the future 
if the company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources  the company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis  or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies 
the company s success depends on new product development 
the company s continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products 
the company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products 
the successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget over runs  technical problems  and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements  including  for example  changes requested or required by governmental and regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of x ray inspection systems  the company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
the company s failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects 
the company s success depends upon its ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for the company s products has been characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements 
the company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its existing products  successfully develop new products that meet changing customer and regulatory requirements and gain market acceptance 
if the company fails to do so  its products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology  in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer 
in developing any new product  the company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if the company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities  it may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue 
the company may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed products that compete with the company s x ray inspection products 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does 
some of its competitors have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the company does  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
the company s failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete 
in the inspection systems market  competition is based primarily on the following factors product performance  functionality and quality  price  the overall costs of the system  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  certification by government authorities  local market presence  and breadth of the sales and service organization 
to remain competitive  the company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner 
the company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the company s business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyrights  trademarks  licensing arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology 
despite its precautions  the steps the company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate

the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights  or to establish the validity of its property rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any such action

in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses for the infringing technology 
if a license were required  the company cannot assure that it would be able to obtain one on commercially reasonable terms  if at all
