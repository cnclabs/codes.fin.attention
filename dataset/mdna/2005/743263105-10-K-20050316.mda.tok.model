introduction the company s reportable business segments and their primary operations include o progress energy carolinas electric pec electric primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina  o progress energy florida pef primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of florida  o competitive commercial operations cco engaged in nonregulated electric generation operations and marketing activities primarily in the southeastern united states  o fuels primarily engaged in natural gas production in texas and louisiana  coal mining and related services  and the production of synthetic fuels and related services  which are located in kentucky  west virginia and virginia  and o rail services rail engaged in various rail and railcar related services in states  mexico and canada 
the progress ventures business unit consists of the fuels and cco operating segments 
the corporate and other category includes other businesses engaged in other nonregulated business areas  including telecommunications  primarily in the eastern united states  and energy services operations and holding company results  which do not meet the requirements for separate segment reporting disclosure 
in  the company realigned its business segments to no longer report the other nonregulated businesses as a reportable business segment 
for comparative purposes  and segment information has been restated to align with the reporting structure 
strategy progress energy is an integrated energy company  with its primary focus on the end use and wholesale electricity markets 
the company operates in retail utility markets in the southeastern united states and competitive markets in the eastern united states 
the target is to develop a business mix of approximately regulated and nonregulated business 
the company is focused on achieving the following key goals restoring balance sheet strength and flexibility  disciplined capital and operations and maintenance o m management to support earnings and current dividend policy and achieving constructive regulatory frameworks in all three regulated jurisdictions 
a summary of the significant financial objectives or issues impacting progress energy  its regulated utilities and nonregulated operations is addressed more fully in the following discussion 
progress energy  inc 
progress energy has several key financial objectives  the first of which is to achieve sustainable earnings growth in its three core energy businesses  which include pec electric  pef and progress ventures excluding synthetic fuels 
in addition  the company seeks to continue its track record of dividend growth  as the company has increased its dividend for consecutive years  and of the last the company also seeks to restore balance sheet strength and flexibility by reducing its debt to total capitalization ratio through selected asset sales  free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures and common dividends and increased equity from retained earnings and ongoing equity issuances 
in the short term  the company s ability to achieve its objectives will be impacted by  among other things  its ability to recover storm costs incurred during  cash flow available to reduce debt after funding capital expenditures and common dividends  obtaining a reasonable rate agreement in florida at the expiration of the current agreement in december and the outcome of the ongoing internal revenue service irs audit of the company s synthetic fuel facilities 
the company s long term challenges include escalating nonfuel operating costs  the need for sufficient earnings growth to sustain the track record of dividend growth  and the scheduled expiration of the section tax credit program for its synthetic fuels business at the end of the company s ability to meet its financial objectives is largely dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its two regulated utilities 
the regulated utilities contributed million of net income and produced of consolidated cash flow from operations in in addition  fuels contributed million of net income  of which million represented synthetic fuel net income 
partially offsetting the net income contribution provided by the regulated utilities and fuels was a loss of million recorded at corporate and other  primarily related to interest expense on holding company debt 
while the company s synthetic fuel operations currently provide significant earnings that are scheduled to expire at the end of  the associated cash flow benefits from synthetic fuels are expected to come in the future when deferred tax credits are ultimately utilized 
credits that have been generated but not yet utilized are carried forward indefinitely as alternative minimum tax credits and will provide positive cash flow when utilized 
at december   deferred credits were million 
see note e and the risk factors section for additional information on the company s synthetic fuel operations and its ability to utilize its current and future tax credits 
progress energy reduced its debt to total capitalization ratio to at the end of as compared to at the end of the company seeks to continue to improve this ratio as it plans to reduce total debt with proceeds from asset sales  free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures and common dividends and growth in equity from retained earnings and ongoing equity issuances 
the company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately billion in both and progress energy s ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable in by both moody s and standard poor s s p 
both ratings agencies cited the uncertainty around the timing of storm cost recovery  potential delays in the company s de leveraging plan  uncertainty about the upcoming rate case in florida and uncertainty about the irs audit of the company s synthetic fuel partnerships in their ratings actions 
the change in outlook has not materially affected progress energy s access to liquidity or the cost of its short term borrowings 
if standard poor s lowers progress energy s senior unsecured rating one ratings category to bb from its current rating  it would be a noninvestment grade rating 
the effect of a noninvestment grade rating would primarily be to increase borrowing costs 
the company s liquidity would essentially remain unchanged as the company believes it could borrow under its revolving credit facilities instead of issuing commercial paper for its short term borrowing needs 
however  there would be additional funding requirements of approximately million due to ratings triggers embedded in various contracts 
see guarantees section under future liquidity and capital resources below and risk factors for more information regarding the potential impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations resulting from a ratings downgrade 
regulated utilities the regulated utilities earnings and operating cash flows are heavily influenced by weather  including related storm damage  the economy  demand for electricity related to customer growth  actions of regulatory agencies and cost controls 
both pec electric and pef operate in retail service territories that are forecasted to have income and population growth higher than the us average 
in recent years  lower industrial sales mainly related to weakness in the textile sector at pec electric have negatively impacted earnings growth 
the company does not expect any significant improvement in industrial sales in the near term 
these combined factors under normal weather conditions are expected to contribute approximately annual retail kilowatt hour kwh sales growth at pec electric and approximately annual retail kilowatt hour kwh sales growth at pef through at least the utilities must continue to invest significant capital in new generation  transmission and distribution facilities to support this load growth 
subject to regulatory approval  these investments are expected to increase the utilities rate base  upon which additional return can be realized that creates the basis for long term financial growth in the utilities 
the company will meet this load growth through the two previously planned approximately mw combined cycle units at pef s hines energy complex in and the contribution from the utilities regulated wholesale business is expected to increase slightly in and be relatively flat over the following few years 
while the two utilities expect retail sales growth in the future  they are facing rising costs 
the company began a cost management initiative in late to permanently reduce by million the projected growth in the company s annual nonfuel o m costs by the end of see cost management initiative under results of operations for more information 
the utilities expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion in both and the company will continue an approximate million program of installing new emission control equipment at pec s coal fired power plants in north carolina 
operating cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital spending in and in the costs associated with the unprecedented series of major hurricanes that impacted the company s service territories significantly impacted the utility operations in restoration of the company s systems from hurricane related damage cost almost million 
although pef has filed for recovery of approximately million of these storm costs  the timing of recovery is not certain at this time 
see other matters below for more information on storm costs incurred during pec electric and pef continue to monitor progress toward a more competitive environment 
no retail electric restructuring legislation has been introduced in the jurisdictions in which pec electric and pef operate 
as part of the clean smokestacks bill in north carolina and an agreement with the public service commission of south carolina scpsc  pec electric is operating under a rate freeze in north carolina through and an agreement not to seek a base retail electric rate increase in south carolina through pef is operating under a retail rate agreement in florida through pef has initiated a rate proceeding in regarding its future base rates 
see note for further discussion of the utilities retail rates 
nonregulated businesses the company s primary nonregulated businesses are cco  fuels and progress rail 
cash flows and earnings of the nonregulated businesses are impacted largely by the ability to obtain additional term contracts or sell energy on the spot market at favorable terms  the volume of synthetic fuel produced and tax credits utilized  and volumes and prices of both coal and natural gas sales 
progress energy expects an excess of supply in the wholesale electric energy market for the next several years 
during  cco entered into additional wholesale power contracts with cooperatives in georgia and will serve approximately one third of the georgia cooperative market starting in cco completed the build out of its nonregulated generation assets in and currently has total capacity of  mw 
the company has no current plans to expand its portfolio of nonregulated generating plants 
cco short term challenges include absorbing the fixed costs associated with these plants and the general weakness in wholesale power markets 
three above market tolling agreements for approximately  mw of capacity expired at the end of cco has replaced the expired agreements with the increased cooperative load in georgia 
the increased cooperative load in georgia will significantly increase cco s revenue and cost of sales from to with lower margins expected 
currently cco has contracts for its planned production capacity  which includes callable resources from the cooperatives  of approximately for  for and for cco will continue its optimization strategy for the nonregulated generation portfolio 
fuels will continue to develop its natural gas production asset base both as a long term economic hedge for the company s nonregulated generation fuel needs and to continue its presence in natural gas markets that will allow it to provide attractive returns for the company s shareholders 
the company has begun exploring strategic alternatives regarding the fuels coal mining business  which could include divesting assets 
as of december   the carrying value of long lived assets of the coal mining business was million 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is a majority owner in five entities and a minority owner in one entity that owns facilities that produce synthetic fuel as defined under the internal revenue code 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuel from these facilities qualifies for tax credits under section if certain requirements are satisfied 
these facilities have private letter rulings plrs from the irs with respect to their synthetic fuel operations 
however  these plrs do not address placed in service date requirements 
the company has resolved certain synthetic fuel tax credit issues with the irs and is continuing to work with the irs to resolve any remaining issues 
the company cannot predict the final resolution of any outstanding matters 
the company has no current plans to alter its synthetic fuel production schedule as a result of these matters 
the company plans to produce approximately to million tons of synthetic fuel in through december   the company had generated approximately billion of synthetic fuel tax credits to date including fpc prior to the acquisition by the company 
see additional discussion of synthetic fuel tax credits in note e and in the risk factors section 
in february  progress energy signed a definitive agreement to sell its progress rail subsidiary to subsidiaries of one equity partners llc for a sales price of million 
proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to reduce debt 
see note for more information 
progress energy and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to various risks 
for a complete discussion of these risks  see the risk factors section 
results of operations for as compared to and as compared to in this section  earnings and the factors affecting earnings are discussed 
the discussion begins with a summarized overview of the company s consolidated earnings  which is followed by a more detailed discussion and analysis by business segment 
overview for the year ended december   progress energy s net income was million or per share compared to million or per share for the same period in the decrease in net income as compared to prior year was due primarily to o reduction in synthetic fuel earnings due to lower synthetic fuel sales due to the impact of hurricanes during the year 
o lower off system wholesale sales  primarily at pec electric 
o higher o m expenses at pec electric 
o recording of litigation settlement reached in the civil suit by strategic resource solutions srs 
o decreased nonregulated generation earnings due to receipt of a contract termination payment on a tolling agreement in  loss recognized on early extinguishment of debt in and higher fixed costs and interest charges in o reduction in revenues due to customer outages in florida associated with the hurricanes 
o increased interest charges due to the reversal of interest expense for resolved tax matters in partially offsetting these items were o favorable weather in the carolinas 
o reduction in revenue sharing provisions in florida 
o favorable customer growth in both the carolinas and florida 
o increased margins as a result of the allowed return on the hines plant in florida 
o increased earnings for natural gas operations  which include the gain recorded on the disposition of certain winchester production company assets 
o increased earnings for rail operations 
o unrealized gains recorded on contingent value obligations cvos 
o reduction in impairments recorded for an investment portfolio and long lived assets 
o reduction in losses recorded for discontinued operations 
o reduction in losses recorded for changes in accounting principles 
for the year ended december   progress energy s net income was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the same period in income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and discontinued operations was million in  a increase from million in net income for increased compared to primarily due to the inclusion in of an impairment of million after tax related to assets in the telecommunications and rail businesses 
the company recorded impairments of million after tax in on an investment portfolio and on long lived assets 
the increase in net income in of million  excluding the impairments  is primarily due to o increase in retail customer growth at the utilities 
o growth in natural gas production and sales 
o higher synthetic fuel sales 
o absence of severe storm costs incurred in in the carolinas 
o lower loss recorded in related to the sale of north carolina natural gas company ncng  with the majority of the loss on the sale being recorded in o lower interest charges in partially offsetting these items were the o net impact of the florida rate settlement 
o impact of the change in the fair value of the cvos 
o milder weather in as compared to o increased benefit related costs 
o higher depreciation expense at both utilities and the fuels and cco segments 
o the impact of changes in accounting principles in basic earnings per share decreased in and increased in due in part to the factors outlined above 
dilution related to issuances under the company s investor plus and employee benefit programs in also reduced basic earnings per share by in dilution related to a november equity issuance of million shares and issuances under the company s investor plus and employee benefit programs in and also reduced basic earnings per share by in beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company ceased recording portions of the fuels segment s operations  primarily synthetic fuel facilities  one month in arrears 
as a result  earnings for the year ended december   included months of operations  resulting in a net income increase of million for the year 
the company s segments contributed the following profit or loss from continuing operations in millions change change pec electric pef fuels cco rail services total segment profit loss  corporate and other total income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net income in march  the sec completed an audit of progress energy service company  llc service company  and recommended that the company change its cost allocation methodology for allocating service company costs 
as part of the audit process  the company was required to change the cost allocation methodology for and record retroactive reallocations between its affiliates in the first quarter of for allocations originally made in and this change in allocation methodology and the related retroactive adjustments have no impact on consolidated expense or earnings 
the new allocation methodology  as compared to the previous allocation methodology  generally decreases expenses in the regulated utilities and increases expenses in the nonregulated businesses 
the regulated utilities reallocations are within o m expense  while the diversified businesses reallocations are generally within diversified business expenses 
the impact on the individual lines of business is included in the following discussions 
cost management initiative on february   as part of a previously announced cost management initiative  the executive officers of the company approved a workforce restructuring 
the restructuring will result in a reduction of approximately positions and is expected to be completed in september of the cost management initiative is designed to permanently reduce by million the projected growth in the company s annual operation and maintenance expenses by the end of in addition to the workforce restructuring  the cost management initiative includes a voluntary enhanced retirement program 
in connection with the cost management initiative  the company expects to incur one time pre tax charges of approximately million 
approximately million of that amount relates to payments for severance benefits  and will be recognized in the first quarter of and paid over time 
the remaining approximately million will be recognized in the second quarter of and relates primarily to postretirement benefits that will be paid over time to those eligible employees who elect to participate in the voluntary enhanced retirement program 
approximately  of the company s  employees are eligible to participate in the voluntary enhanced retirement program 
the total cost management initiative charges could change significantly depending upon how many eligible employees elect early retirement under the voluntary enhanced retirement program and the salary  service years and age of such employees see note 
energy delivery capitalization practice the company has reviewed its capitalization policies for its energy delivery business units in pec and pef 
that review indicated that in the areas of outage and emergency work not associated with major storms and allocation of indirect costs  both pec and pef should revise the way that they estimate the amount of capital costs associated with such work 
the company has implemented such changes effective january   which include more detailed classification of outage and emergency work and result in more precise estimation and a process of retesting accounting estimates on an annual basis 
as a result of the changes in accounting estimates for the outage and emergency work and indirect costs  a lesser proportion of pec s and pef s costs will be capitalized on a prospective basis 
the company estimates that the combined impact for both utilities in will be that approximately million of costs that would have been capitalized under the previous policies will be expensed 
pursuant to sfas no 
 pec and pef have informed the state regulators having jurisdiction over them of this change and that the new estimation process will be implemented effective january  the company has also requested a method change from the irs 
progress energy carolinas electric pec electric contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in profits for as compared to is primarily due to higher o m charges and lower wholesale revenues partially offset by the favorable impact of weather  increased revenues from customer growth and a reduction in investment losses and impairment charges compared to the prior year 
the slight increase in profits in  when compared to  was primarily due to customer growth  strong wholesale sales during the first quarter of  lower service company allocations and lower interest costs  which were offset by unfavorable weather in  higher depreciation expense and increased benefit related costs 
revenues pec electric s electric revenues and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in millions customer class change change residential    commercial industrial governmental total retail revenues    wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues    pec electric s electric energy sales and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in thousands of mwh customer class change change residential    commercial    industrial    governmental    total retail energy sales    wholesale    unbilled total mwh sales    pec electric s revenues  excluding recoverable fuel revenues of million and million for and  respectively  increased million 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to increased retail revenues of million as a result of favorable weather  with cooling degree days above prior year 
retail customer growth contributed an additional million in revenues in pec electric s retail customer base increased as approximately  new customers were added in the increase in retail revenues was offset partially by lower wholesale revenues 
wholesale revenues decreased million when compared to million in the decrease in pec electric s wholesale revenues in from is primarily the result of reduced excess generation sales 
revenues for included strong sales to the northeastern united states as a result of favorable market conditions 
in addition  lower contracted capacity compared to further reduced wholesale revenues 
the remaining reduction in wholesale revenues is attributable to an inelastic power market 
while the cost of fuel continues to rise  the power market prices have not responded as quickly to the fuel increases 
the differential between fuel cost and market price limited opportunities to enter the market 
pec monitors its wholesale contract portfolio on a regular basis 
during and  several contracts expired or were renegotiated at lower prices 
due to the slightly depressed wholesale market and increased competition  this trend could continue as contracts are renewed in the upcoming years 
the expiration and renegotiation of wholesale contracts is a normal business activity 
pec actively manages its portfolio by seeking to sign new contracts to replace expiring arrangements 
pec electric s revenues  excluding recoverable fuel revenues of million and million in and  respectively  were unchanged from to milder weather in  when compared to  accounted for a million retail revenue reduction 
while heating degree days in were above prior year  cooling degree days were below prior year 
however  the more severe weather in the northeast region of the united states during the first quarter of drove a million increase in wholesale revenues 
additionally  retail customer growth in generated an additional million of revenues in pec electric s retail customer base increased as approximately  new customers were added in downturns in the economy during and impacted energy usage within the industrial customer class 
total industrial revenues  excluding fuel revenues  declined during when compared to by million  as sales to industrial customers decreased due to a general industrial slowdown 
decreases in the textile industry and the chemical industry were among the largest 
this declining trend leveled out in as industrial sales increased in the primary and fabricated metal  chemicals  lumber and food industries 
industrial sales growth is expected to be flat or very low as expired textile quotas are expected to lower textile sales and balance gains in other industries 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power costs represent the costs of generation  which include fuel purchases for generation  as well as energy purchased in the market to meet customer load 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  and  as such  changes in these expenses do not have a material impact on earnings 
the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to the same period in the prior year 
fuel used in electric generation increased million to million compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to an increase in fuel used in generation of million due to higher fuel costs and a change in generation mix 
higher fuel costs are being driven primarily by an increase in coal prices 
outages at several nuclear facilities during the year resulted in increased combustion turbine generation  which has a higher average fuel cost 
see part i  item i  fuel and purchased power of electric pec for a summary of average fuel costs 
the increase in fuel used in generation is offset by a reduction in deferred fuel expense as a result of the under recovery of current period fuel costs 
purchased power expenses increased million to million compared to prior year 
the increase in purchased power is due primarily to an increase in price 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to the same period in the prior year 
fuel used in electric generation increased million in  compared to prior year  primarily due to higher prices incurred for coal  oil and natural gas used during generation 
costs for fuel per btu increased for all three commodities during the year 
see part i  item i  fuel and purchased power of electric pec for a summary of average fuel costs 
purchased power expense decreased million in  compared to million in  mainly due to a decrease in the volume purchased as milder weather reduced system requirements and due to the renegotiation at more favorable terms of two contracts that expired during the year 
operations and maintenance o m o m expenses were million for  which represents an million increase compared to this increase is driven primarily by higher outage costs and storm costs in than in the prior year 
outages increased o m costs by million primarily due to an increase in the number and scope of nuclear plant outages in in addition  costs associated with restoration efforts after severe storms increased o m expense million 
storm costs for included costs related to an ice storm and hurricanes charley and ivan in the north carolina service territory 
pec electric also incurred storm costs in  however  the company requested and the ncuc approved deferral of these costs 
the company did not seek to defer costs associated with the ice storm  which hit the north carolina service territory  and hurricanes charley and ivan 
o m expenses also increased million due to higher salary and benefit related expenditures 
in addition  o m charges in the prior year were favorably impacted by million related to the retroactive reallocation of service company costs 
o m expenses were million in  which represents a million decrease compared to o m expense in included severe storm costs of million 
those costs  along with lower service company allocations of million  due to the change in allocation methodology as required by the sec in early  are the primary reasons for decreased o m expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by higher benefit related costs of million 
pec electric incurred o m costs of million related to three severe storms in the ncuc allowed deferral of million of these storm costs 
these costs are being amortized over a five year period  beginning in the months the expenses were incurred 
pec electric amortized million of these costs in  which is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated income statement 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents an million increase compared to this increase is attributable primarily to the impact of the nc clean air legislation 
pec electric recorded the maximum amortization allowed under the legislation in nc clean air amortization increased million to million in compared to million in depreciation expense also increased million for assets placed in service 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense related to depreciation studies filed during the year 
during  pec met the requirements of both the ncuc and the scpsc for the implementation of depreciation studies that allowed the utility to reduce the rates used to calculate depreciation expense 
the annual reduction in depreciation expense is approximately million compared to the reduction is due primarily to extended lives at each of pec s nuclear units 
the new rates became effective january depreciation and amortization increased million in  compared to million in depreciation and amortization increased million related to the impact of the nc clean air legislation and decreased million related to the impact of the accelerated nuclear amortization program 
both programs are approved by the state regulatory agencies and are discussed further at notes b and in addition  depreciation increased million due to additional assets placed into service 
taxes other than on income taxes other than on income were million for  which represents an million increase compared to the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to an increase in gross receipts taxes of million related to an increase in revenues and a adjustment related to the prior year 
the remaining variance in other taxes is due to an increase in property taxes of million due to higher property appraisals partially offset by a reduction in payroll taxes of million 
taxes other than on income were million in  which represents a million increase compared to prior year 
this increase is due to an increase in property taxes and payroll taxes of million each 
interest expense net interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
declines in interest expense in resulted from reduced short term debt and refinancing certain long term debt with lower interest rate debt 
income tax expense income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of the tax benefit that was previously held at the company s holding company was allocated to pec electric 
as required by an sec order issued in  certain holding company tax benefits are allocated to profitable subsidiaries 
other fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to changes in pre tax income 
progress energy florida pef contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
profits for increased due to favorable customer growth  a reduction in the provision for revenue sharing  favorable wholesale revenues  the additional return on investment on the hines plant and reduced o m expenses 
these items were partially offset by unfavorable weather  a reduction in revenues related to the hurricanes  increased interest expense and increased depreciation expense from assets placed in service 
the decrease in profits in  when compared to  was primarily due to the impact of the rate case stipulation  higher benefit related costs primarily related to higher pension expense  higher depreciation and the unfavorable impact of weather 
these amounts were partially offset by continued customer growth and lower interest charges 
in  pef s profits were affected by the outcome of the rate case stipulation  which included a one time retroactive revenue refund  a decrease in retail rates of effective may   provisions for revenue sharing with the retail customer base  lower depreciation and amortization and increased service revenue rates see note c

this increase was due primarily to favorable customer growth  which increased revenues million 
pef has  additional retail customers compared to prior year 
revenues were also favorably impacted by a reduction in the provision for revenue sharing of million 
results for included an additional refund of million related to the revenue sharing provision as ordered by the fpsc in july in addition  improved wholesale sales increased revenues by million 
included in fuel revenues is the recovery of depreciation and capital costs associated with the hines unit  which was placed into service in december and contributed million in additional revenues in the recovery of the hines unit costs through the fuel clause is in accordance with the rate stipulation see note c 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in revenues related to customer outages for hurricanes charley  frances and jeanne of approximately million and the impact of milder weather in the current year of million 
pef s revenues  excluding recoverable fuel and other pass through revenues of billion and billion in and  respectively  were unchanged from to revenues were favorably impacted by million in  primarily as a result of customer growth approximately  additional customers 
in addition  other operating revenues were favorable by million due primarily to higher wheeling and transmission revenues and higher service charge revenues resulting from increased rates allowed under the rate settlement 
these increases were offset by the negative impact of the rate settlement  which decreased revenues  lower wholesale sales and the impact of unfavorable weather 
the provision for revenue sharing increased million in compared to the million provision recorded in revenues in were also impacted by the final resolution of the revenue sharing provisions  as the fpsc issued an order in july that required pef to refund an additional million to customers related to the rate reduction from the settlement accounted for an additional million decline in revenues 
the impact of the rate settlement was partially offset by the absence of the prior year interim rate refund of million 
lower wholesale revenues excluding fuel revenues of million and the million impact of milder weather also reduced base revenues during expenses fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power costs represent the costs of generation  which include fuel purchases for generation  as well as energy purchased in the market to meet customer load 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  and  as such  changes in these expenses do not have a material impact on earnings 
the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion in  which represents a million increase compared to this increase is due to increases in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power expenses of million and million  respectively 
higher system requirements and increased fuel costs in the current year account for million of the increase in fuel used in electric generation 
the remaining increase is due to the recovery of fuel expenses that were deferred in the prior year  partially offset by the deferral of current year under recovered fuel expenses 
in november  the fpsc approved pef s request for a cost adjustment in its annual fuel filing due to the rising costs of fuel 
the new rates became effective january fuel used in generation and purchased power expenses were billion in  which represents an million increase compared to the prior year 
higher costs to generate electricity and higher purchased power costs as a result of an increase in volume due to system requirements and higher natural gas prices resulted in a million increase partially offset by the deferral of under recovered fuel and purchased power expense of million 
operations and maintenance o m o m expenses were million in  which represents a million decrease when compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily related to favorable benefit related costs of million  primarily due to lower pension costs which resulted from improved pension asset performance 
o m expenses were million in  which represents a million increase when compared to the prior year 
the increase is largely related to increases in certain benefit related expenses of million  which consisted primarily of higher pension expense of million and higher operational costs related to the cr nuclear outage and plant maintenance 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for  which represents a decrease of million when compared to the prior year  primarily due to the amortization of the tiger bay regulatory asset in the prior year 
the tiger bay regulatory asset  for contract termination costs  was recovered pursuant to an agreement between pef and the fpsc that was approved in the amortization of the regulatory asset was calculated using revenues collected under the fuel adjustment clause  as such  fluctuations in this expense did not have an impact on earnings 
during  tiger bay amortization was million 
the tiger bay asset was fully amortized in september the decrease in tiger bay amortization was partially offset by additional depreciation for assets placed in service  including depreciation for hines unit  of approximately million 
this depreciation expense is being recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause as allowed by the fpsc 
see discussion of the return on hines in the revenues analysis above 
depreciation and amortization was million in  which represents an increase of million when compared to depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional assets being placed into service that were partially offset by lower amortization of the tiger bay regulatory asset of million  which was fully amortized in september taxes other than on income taxes other than on income were million in  which represents an increase of million compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to increases in gross receipts and franchise taxes of million and million  respectively  related to an increase in revenues and an increase in property taxes of million due to increases in property placed in service and tax rates 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in payroll taxes of million 
taxes other than on income were million in  which represents an increase of million compared to prior year 
this increase was due to increases in payroll taxes of million and increases in gross receipts and franchise taxes of million combined 
interest expense interest charges  net were million in  which represents an increase of million compared to the prior year 
interest charges  net were million in  which represents a million decrease compared to the prior year 
the fluctuations were primarily due to interest costs in being favorably impacted by the reversal of interest expense due to the resolution of certain tax matters 
income tax expense income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of the tax benefit that was previously held at the company s holding company was allocated to pef 
as required by an sec order issued in  certain holding company tax benefits are allocated to profitable subsidiaries 
other fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to changes in pre tax income 
diversified businesses the company s diversified businesses consist of the fuels segment  the cco segment and the rail services segment 
fuels the fuels segment operations include synthetic fuels production  natural gas production  coal extraction and terminal operations 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company ceased recording portions of fuels segment operations  primarily synthetic fuel facilities  one month in arrears 
as a result  earnings for the year ended december   included months of operations  resulting in a net income increase of million for the year 
the following summarizes fuels segment profits in millions synthetic fuel operations natural gas operations coal fuel and other operations segment profits synthetic fuel operations the production and sale of synthetic fuel generate operating losses  but qualify for tax credits under section of the code  which more than offset the effect of such losses see note e 
the operations resulted in the following losses prior to tax credits in millions tons sold after tax losses excluding tax credits tax credits net profit the company s synthetic fuel production levels and the amount of tax credits it can claim each year are a function of the company s projected consolidated regular federal income tax liability 
synthetic fuel operations net profits decreased in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in synthetic fuel production and an increase in operating expenses in the company s total synthetic fuel production of approximately eight million tons in is down compared to production levels of approximately million tons as a result of hurricane costs  which reduced the company s projected regular tax liability and its corresponding ability to record tax credits from its synthetic fuel production 
in addition  earnings in include a million favorable tax credit true up related to as of september   the company anticipated an ability to record approximately five million tons of synthetic fuels production based on the company s projected regular tax liability for this estimate was based upon the company s projected casualty loss as a result of the storms 
therefore  the company recorded a charge of million in the third quarter for tax credits associated with approximately million tons sold during the year that the company anticipated it would not be able to use 
on november   pef filed a petition with the fpsc to recover million of storm costs plus interest from customers over a two year period 
based on a reasonable expectation at december   that the fpsc will grant the requested recovery of the storm costs  the company s loss from the casualty is less than originally anticipated 
accordingly  as of december   the company s anticipated tax liability supported credits on approximately eight million tons 
therefore  the company recorded tax credits of million for the quarter ended december   for tax credits associated with approximately three million tons sold during the year that the company now anticipates can be used 
as of december   the company anticipates that approximately million of tax credits associated with approximately million tons sold during the year could not be used see note e 
the company ceased operations at its earthco facilities for the last three months of due to the decrease in the company s projected tax liability  and these facilities were restarted in january the company believes its right to recover storm costs is well established  however  the company cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter 
if the fpsc should deny pef s petition for the recovery of storm costs in  there could be a material impact on the amount of synthetic fuel production and results of operations 
synthetic fuels net profits for increased as compared to due to higher sales  improved margins and a higher tax credit per ton 
the tax credits also include a million favorable true up from additionally  synthetic fuels results in include months of operations for some facilities 
prior to the fourth quarter of  results of these synthetic fuels operations had been recognized one month in arrears 
the net impact of this action increased net income by million for the year 
natural gas operations natural gas operations generated profits of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
natural gas profits increased million in compared to this increase is attributable primarily to the gain recognized on the sale of gas assets during the year 
in december  the company sold certain gas producing properties and related assets owned by winchester production company  ltd 
north texas gas operations 
because the sale significantly altered the ongoing relationship between capitalized costs and remaining proved reserves  under the full cost method of accounting the pre tax gain of million million net of taxes was recognized in earnings rather than as a reduction of the basis of the company s remaining oil and gas properties 
in addition  an increase in production  coupled with higher gas prices in  contributed to the increased earnings in as compared to production levels increased resulting from the acquisition of north texas gas in late february and increased drilling in volume and prices have increased and  respectively  for compared to natural gas profits increased to million in compared to million in the increase in production and price resulting from the acquisitions of westchester in renamed winchester energy in and north texas gas in the first quarter of drove increased revenue and earnings in compared to in october  the company completed the sale of certain gas producing properties owned by mesa hydrocarbons  llc mesa

the increase in profits for is primarily due to higher volumes and margins for coal fuel operations of million after tax 
in addition  coal results in included the recording of an impairment of certain assets at the kentucky may coal mine totaling million after tax 
this favorability was offset by a reduction in profits of million after tax for fuel transportation operations related to the waterborne transportation ruling by the fpsc see note c 
profits were also negatively impacted by higher corporate costs of million in corporate costs in the prior year included million of favorability related to the reduction of an environmental reserve see note 
the remaining unfavorability in corporate costs is attributable to increased interest expense related to unresolved tax matters and higher professional fees 
coal fuel and other operations profits decreased million from to the decrease is due primarily to the recording of an impairment of certain assets at the kentucky may coal mine totaling million after tax 
the decrease in profits is also due to the impact of the retroactive service company allocation in the company is exploring strategic alternatives regarding the fuels coal mining business  which could include divesting these assets 
as of december   the carrying value of long lived assets of the coal mining business was million 
the company cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter

in addition  plant operating expenses increased million pre tax primarily due to higher gas transportation service charges  which increased over prior year due to a full period of expenses being reflected in current year results 
cco results for also include losses of million pre tax associated with the extinguishment of a debt obligation 
cco terminated the genco financing arrangement in december the million pre tax loss is comprised of a million write off of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and a million realized loss on exiting the related interest rate hedge 
expenses were favorably impacted by a reduction in service company allocations 
results for were negatively impacted by the retroactive reallocation of service company costs of million million after tax 
cco s operations generated segment profits of million in compared to segment profits of million in the increase in revenue for when compared to is primarily due to increased contracted capacity on newly constructed plants  energy revenue from a new  full requirements power supply contract and a tolling agreement termination payment received during the first quarter

the increase in costs of goods sold is due to increased costs for inventory  labor and operations as a result of the increased volume in the recycling operations  locomotive and railcar services and engineering and track services 
in addition  results in were negatively impacted by the retroactive reallocation of service company costs of million after tax 
the favorability related to the reallocation was offset by an increase in general and administrative costs in related primarily to higher professional fees associated with divestiture efforts

cumulative effect of accounting changes in  progress energy recorded adjustments for the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles due to the adoption of several new accounting pronouncements 
these adjustments totaled to a million loss after tax  which was due primarily to new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance related to the accounting for certain contracts 
this guidance discusses whether the pricing in a contract that contains broad market indices qualifies for certain exceptions that would not require the contract to be recorded at its fair value 
pec electric had a purchase power contract with broad river llc that did not meet the criteria for an exception  and a negative fair value adjustment was recorded in for million after tax see note a 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in doing so  certain estimates were made that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on the financial results of the company and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
utility regulation as discussed in note  the company s regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates the company is permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine the company is permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
this rate making process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the changing regulatory framework in each state in which the company operates  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
the company continually reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
note provides additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on the company 
asset impairments as discussed in note  the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators exist 
examples of these indicators include current period losses combined with a history of losses  or a projection of continuing losses  or a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset group 
if an indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations and various factors are considered  including projected revenues and cost and market conditions 
due to the reduction in coal production at the kentucky may coal mine  the company evaluated its long lived assets in and recorded an impairment of million before tax million after tax 
fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows 
during  the company recorded pre tax long lived asset impairments of million related to its telecommunications business 
the fair value of these assets was determined considering various factors  including a valuation study heavily weighted on a discounted cash flow methodology and using market approaches as supporting information 
the company continually reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
in  pec s affordable housing investment ahi portfolio was reviewed and deemed to be impaired based on various factors  including continued operating losses of the ahi portfolio and management performance issues arising at certain properties within the ahi portfolio 
as a result  pec recorded an impairment of million on a pre tax basis during pec also recorded an impairment of million for a cost investment 
during  the company recorded pre tax impairments to its cost method investment in interpath of million 
the fair value of this investment was determined considering various factors  including a valuation study heavily weighted on a discounted cash flow methodology and using market approaches as supporting information 
these cash flows included numerous assumptions  including  the pace at which the telecommunications market would rebound 
in the fourth quarter of  the company sold its remaining interest in interpath for a nominal amount 
under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling based on the present value of discounted at future net revenues using current prices  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the ceiling test takes into consideration the prices of qualifying cash flow hedges as of the balance sheet date 
if the ceiling discounted revenues is not equal to or greater than total capitalized costs  the company is required to write down capitalized costs to this level 
the company performs this ceiling test calculation every quarter 
no write downs were required in  or goodwill as discussed in note  effective january   the company adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
the company completed the initial transitional goodwill impairment test  which indicated that the company s goodwill was not impaired as of january  the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the cco segment in the first quarters of and  and the annual goodwill impairment test for the pec electric and pef segments in the second quarters of and  each of which indicated no impairment 
if the fair values for the utility segments were lower by approximately  there still would be no impact on the reported value of their goodwill 
the carrying amounts of goodwill at december  and  for reportable segments pec electric  pef and cco  are  million   million and million  respectively 
in december  million in goodwill was acquired as part of progress telecommunications corporation s partial acquisition of epik and was reported in the corporate and other segment 
the company revised the preliminary epik purchase price allocation as of september  and the million of goodwill was reallocated to certain tangible assets acquired based on the results of valuations and appraisals 
synthetic fuels tax credits as discussed in note e  progress energy  through the fuels business unit  owns facilities that produce synthetic fuel as defined under the internal revenue code 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuels from these facilities qualifies for tax credits under section if certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuels differs significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce such synthetic fuels and that the fuel was produced from a facility placed in service before july  the amount of section credits that the company is allowed to claim in any calendar year is limited by the amount of the company s regular federal income tax liability 
synthetic fuels tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits on the consolidated balance sheets 
all of progress energy s synthetic fuel facilities have received plrs from the irs with respect to their operations  although these do not address placed in service date determinations 
the plrs do not limit the production on which synthetic fuel credits may be claimed 
the current section tax credit program expires at the end of these tax credits are subject to review by the irs  and if progress energy fails to prevail through the administrative or legal process  there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section credits  with a significant impact on earnings and cash flows 
additionally  the ability to use tax credits currently being carried forward could be denied 
see further discussion in other matters below  note e and in the risk factors section 
pension costs as discussed in note a  progress energy maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement pension plans 
the company s reported costs are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  actual plan asset returns and key actuarial assumptions  such as expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs 
due to a slight decline in the market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate used to present value future benefit payments  the company lowered the discount rate to at december   which will increase the benefit costs recognized  all other factors remaining constant 
plan assets performed well in  with returns of approximately 
that positive asset performance will result in decreased pension costs in  all other factors remaining constant 
evaluations of the effects of these and other factors have not been completed  but the company estimates that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be approximately to million higher than the amount recorded in the company has pension plan assets with a fair value of approximately billion at december  the company s expected rate of return on pension plan assets is 
the company reviews this rate on a regular basis 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 
 the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  the company would adjust that return only if its fundamental assessment of the debt and equity markets changes or its investment policy changes significantly 
the company believes that its pension plans asset investment mix and historical performance support the long term rate of being used 
the company did not adjust the rate in response to short term market fluctuations such as the abnormally high market return levels of the latter s  recent years market declines and the market rebound in and a change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension costs by approximately million 
another factor affecting the company s pension costs  and sensitivity of the costs to plan asset performance  is its selection of a method to determine the market related value of assets  ie  the asset value to which the expected long term rate of return is applied 
sfas no 
specifies that entities may use either fair value or an averaging method that recognizes changes in fair value over a period not to exceed five years  with the method selected applied on a consistent basis from year to year 
the company has historically used a five year averaging method 
when the company acquired florida progress corporation florida progress in  it retained the florida progress historical use of fair value to determine market related value for florida progress pension assets 
changes in plan asset performance are reflected in pension costs sooner under the fair value method than the five year averaging method  and  therefore  pension costs tend to be more volatile using the fair value method 
for example  in the expected return for assets subject to the averaging method was lower than in  whereas the expected return for assets subject to the fair value method was higher than in approximately of the company s pension plan assets is subject to each of the two methods 
liquidity and capital resources overview progress energy is a registered holding company and  as such  has no operations of its own 
the company s primary cash needs at the holding company level are its common stock dividend and interest expense and principal payments on its billion of senior unsecured debt 
the ability to meet these needs is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its two electric utilities and nonregulated subsidiaries  and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds to progress energy 
other significant cash requirements of the company arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of its electric utility operations and expenditures for its diversified businesses  primarily those of the fuels segment 
the company relies upon its operating cash flow  primarily generated by its two regulated electric utility subsidiaries  commercial paper and bank facilities  and its ability to access long term debt and equity capital markets for sources of liquidity 
the majority of the company s operating costs are related to its two regulated electric utilities  and a significant portion of these costs is recovered from customers through fuel and energy cost recovery clauses 
as a registered holding company under public utility holding company act of puhca  progress energy obtains approval from the sec for the issuance and sale of securities as well as the establishment of intercompany extensions of credit utility and nonutility money pools 
pec and pef participate in the utility money pool  which allows the two utilities to lend and borrow between each other 
a nonutility money pool allows progress energy s nonregulated operations to lend and borrow funds among each other 
progress energy can lend money to the utility and nonutility money pools but cannot borrow funds 
cash from operations  asset sales and the issuance of common stock are expected to fund capital expenditures and common dividends for any excess cash proceeds would be used to reduce debt 
to the extent necessary  short and long term debt may also be used as a source of liquidity 
the company believes its internal and external liquidity resources will be sufficient to fund its current business plans 
risk factors associated with commercial paper backup credit facilities and credit ratings are discussed below and in the risk factors section of this report 
the following discussion of the company s liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations cash from operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the three years ending december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
cash from operating activities for when compared with decreased million  as the net result of the impact of hurricane costs  partially offset by the impact of an under recovery of fuel costs in the increase in cash from operating activities for when compared with is largely the result of improved operating results at pec 
during the third quarter of  four hurricanes struck significant portions of the company s service territories  with the most significant impact on pef s territory 
restoration of the company s systems from storm related damage cost an estimated million 
pec s cost totaled million  of which million was charged to o m and million was charged to capital 
pef s cost totaled million  of which million was charged to storm damage reserve pursuant to a regulatory order and million was charged to capital 
on november   pef filed a petition with the florida public service commission fpsc to recover million of storm costs plus interest from retail rate payers over a two year period see note 
progress energy is allowed to recover fuel costs incurred by pec and pef through their respective fuel cost recovery surcharges 
fuel price volatility can lead to over or under recovery of fuel costs  as changes in fuel prices are not immediately reflected in fuel surcharges due to regulatory lag in setting the surcharges 
as a result  fuel price volatility can be both a source of and a drag on liquidity resources  depending on what phase of the cycle of price volatility the company is experiencing 
in addition  in pef agreed with the fpsc to use a two year period to determine the surcharge for the underrecovered fuel costs incurred in see note c 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the three years ending december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively

future liquidity and capital resources the company s two electric utilities produced over of consolidated cash from operations in it is expected that the two electric utilities will continue to produce a majority of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years as its nonregulated investments  primarily generation assets  improve asset utilization and increase their operating cash flows 
pef notified the fpsc in january of its intent to file for an increase in its base rates effective january  if approved by the fpsc  an increase in pef s base rates would increase future operating cash flows 
pef has faced significant cost increases over the past decade and expects its operational costs to continue to increase 
these costs include the costs associated with completion of the hines generation facility  extraordinary hurricane damage costs including capital costs not expected to be directly recoverable  the need to replenish the depleted storm reserve and the expected infrastructure investment necessary to meet high customer expectations  coupled with the demands placed on pef as a result of strong customer growth 
if the fpsc does not approve pef s request to increase base rates  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
related risks are described in more detail in the risk factors section 
in addition  fuels synthetic fuel operations do not currently produce positive operating cash flow due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and when tax credits are realized for tax purposes 
see note e for further discussion 
capital expenditures total cash from operations provided the funding for the company s capital expenditures  including property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and diversified business property additions during  excluding proceeds from asset sales of million 
as shown in the table below  progress energy expects the majority of its capital expenditures to be incurred at its regulated operations 
see note f for a discussion of expected impacts on future capital expenditures due to changes in capitalization practice for regulated operations 
the company anticipates its regulated capital expenditures will increase in due to increased spending on clean air initiatives 
forecasted nonregulated expenditures relate primarily to progress fuels and its gas operations  mainly for drilling new wells 
actual forecasted in millions regulated capital expenditures    nuclear fuel expenditures afudc borrowed funds nonregulated capital expenditures total     regulated capital expenditures in the table above include total expenditures from through of approximately million expected to be incurred at pec fossil fueled electric generating facilities to comply with section of the clean air act  referred to as the nox sip call 
the company also expects to incur expenditures of approximately million million at pec and million at pef from through and additional expenditures of approximately million to million million to million at pec and million to million at pef from through for compliance with the section b requirements of the clean water act see note in june  legislation was enacted in north carolina requiring the state s electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide so from coal fired power plants 
pec expects its capital costs to meet these emission targets will be approximately million by for the years through  the company expects to incur approximately million of total capital costs associated with this legislation  which is included in the table above see note 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  market volatility and economic trends

approximately million of that amount relates to payments for severance benefits  which will be recognized in the first quarter of and paid over time 
the remaining approximately million will be recognized in the second quarter of and relates primarily to postretirement benefits that will be paid over time to those eligible employees who elect to participate in the voluntary enhanced retirement program see note 
credit facilities at december   the company and its subsidiaries had committed lines of credit and outstanding balances as shown in the table in note all of the credit facilities supporting the credit were arranged through a syndication of financial institutions 
there are no bilateral contracts associated with these facilities 
the company s financial policy precludes issuing commercial paper in excess of its supporting lines of credit 
at december   the company had million of commercial paper outstanding  million reserved for backing of letters of credit and an additional million drawn directly from the credit facilities  leaving million available for issuance or drawdown 
in addition  the company has requirements to pay minimal annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facilities 
at december   the company had million of commercial paper outstanding 
the company expects to continue to use commercial paper issuances as a source of liquidity as long as it maintains its current short term ratings 
all of the credit facilities include a defined maximum total debt to total capital ratio leverage and coverage ratios 
the company is in compliance with these covenants at december  see note for a discussion of the credit facilities financial covenants  material adverse change clause provisions and cross default provisions 
at december   the calculated ratios for the companies  pursuant to the terms of the agreements  are as disclosed in note both pec and pef plan to enter into new five year lines of credit in to replace their existing credit facilities 
the company has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which senior notes  junior debentures  common and preferred stock and other trust preferred securities are available for issuance by the company 
at december   the company had approximately billion available under this shelf registration 
progress energy and pef each have an uncommitted bank bid facility authorizing each of them to borrow and reborrow  and have loans outstanding at any time  up to million and million  respectively 
at december   there were no outstanding loans against these facilities 
pec currently has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which it can issue up to million of various long term securities 
pef currently has on file registration statements under which it can issue an aggregate of million of various long term debt securities 
both pec and pef can issue first mortgage bonds under their respective first mortgage bond indentures 
at december   pec and pef could issue up to billion and billion  respectively  based on property additions and billion and million  respectively  based upon retirements 
the following table shows progress energy s and progress energy carolinas capital structure at december progress energy pec common stock preferred stock and minority interest total debt the amount and timing of future sales of company securities will depend on market conditions  operating cash flow  asset sales and the specific needs of the company 
the company may from time to time sell securities beyond the amount needed to meet capital requirements in order to allow for the early redemption of long term debt  the redemption of preferred stock  the reduction of short term debt or for other general corporate purposes 
credit rating matters the major credit rating agencies have currently rated the company s securities as follows moody s investors service standard poor s fitch ratings progress energy  inc outlook negative negative stable corporate credit rating n a bbb n a senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb commercial paper p a n a progress energy carolinas  inc corporate credit rating n a bbb n a commercial paper p a f senior secured debt a bbb a senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb progress energy florida  inc corporate credit rating n a bbb n a commercial paper p a f senior secured debt a bbb a senior unsecured debt a bbb bbb fpc capital i preferred stock baa bb n a progress capital holdings  inc senior unsecured debt baa bbb n a guaranteed by florida progress corporation 
these ratings reflect the current views of these rating agencies  and no assurances can be given that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
however  the company monitors its financial condition as well as market conditions that could ultimately affect its credit ratings 
on february   moody s credit rating agency announced that it lowered the ratings of pef  progress capital holdings and fpc capital trust i and changed their rating outlooks to stable from negative 
moody s affirmed the ratings of progress energy and pec 
the rating outlooks continue to be stable at pec and negative at progress energy 
moody s stated that it took this action primarily due to declining cash flow coverages and rising leverage  higher o m costs  uncertainty regarding the timing of hurricane cost recovery  regulatory risks associated with the upcoming rate case in florida and ongoing capital requirements to meet florida s growing demand 
on october   s p changed progress energy s outlook from stable to negative 
s p cited the uncertainties regarding the timing of the recovery of hurricane costs  the company s debt reduction plans and the irs audit of the company s earthco synthetic fuels facilities as the reasons for the change in outlook 
on october   s p reduced the short term debt rating of progress energy  pec and pef to a from a  as a result of their change in outlook discussed above 
on october   moody s changed its outlook for progress energy from stable to negative and placed the ratings of pef under review for possible downgrade 
pec s ratings were affirmed by moody s 
moody s cited the following reasons for its change in the outlook for progress energy financial ratios that are weak for its current rating category  rising o m  pension  benefit and insurance costs  and delays in executing its deleveraging plan 
with respect to pef  moody s cited declining cash flow coverages and rising leverage over the last several years  expected funding needs for a large capital expenditure program  risks with regard to its upcoming rate case and the timing of hurricane cost recovery as reasons for putting its ratings under review 
the changes by s p and moody s do not trigger any debt or guarantee collateral requirements  nor do they have any material impact on the overall liquidity of progress energy or any of its affiliates 
to date  progress energy s  pec s and pef s access to the commercial paper markets has not been materially impacted by the rating agencies actions 
however  the changes have increased the interest rate incurred on its short term borrowings by to 
if standard poor s lowers progress energy s senior unsecured rating one ratings category to bb from its current rating  it would be a noninvestment grade rating 
the effect of a noninvestment grade rating would primarily be to increase borrowing costs 
the company s liquidity would essentially remain unchanged  as the company believes it could borrow under its revolving credit facilities instead of issuing commercial paper for its short term borrowing needs 
however  there would be additional funding requirements of approximately million due to ratings triggers embedded in various contracts  as more fully described below under guarantees and risk factors 
the company and its subsidiaries debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any ratings triggers  which would cause the acceleration of interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade 
however  in the event of a downgrade  the company and or its subsidiaries may be subject to increased interest costs on the credit facilities backing up the commercial paper programs 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries have certain contracts that have provisions triggered by a ratings downgrade to a rating below investment grade 
these contracts include counterparty trade agreements  derivative contracts  certain progress energy guarantees and various types of third party purchase agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company s off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations are described below 
guarantees as a part of normal business  progress energy and certain wholly owned subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing future financial or performance assurances to third parties that are outside the scope of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to progress energy and subsidiaries on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes 
the company s guarantees include performance obligations under power supply agreements  tolling agreements  transmission agreements  gas agreements  fuel procurement agreements and trading operations 
the company s guarantees also include standby letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees in support of nuclear decommissioning 
at december   the company had issued billion of guarantees for future financial or performance assurance 
management does not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under the guarantees of performance issued by or on behalf of affiliates 
the majority of contracts supported by the guarantees contain provisions that trigger guarantee obligations based on downgrade events to below investment grade below bbb or baa  ratings triggers  monthly netting of exposure and or payments and offset provisions in the event of a default 
the recent outlook changes from s p and moody s do not trigger any guarantee obligations 
as of december   if the guarantee obligations were triggered  the maximum amount of liquidity requirements to support ongoing operations within a day period  associated with guarantees for the company s nonregulated portfolio and power supply agreements was million 
the company would meet this obligation with cash or letters of credit 
as of december   progress energy had guarantees issued on behalf of third parties of approximately million 
see note d for a discussion of guarantees in accordance with fin no 
market risk and derivatives under its risk management policy  the company may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
contractual obligations the company is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financial arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services 
amounts in the following table are estimated based upon contractual terms and actual amounts will likely differ from amounts presented below 
further disclosure regarding the company s contractual obligations is included in the respective notes 
the company takes into consideration the future commitments when assessing its liquidity and future financing needs

the company s maturing debt obligations are generally expected to be refinanced with new debt issuances in the capital markets 
however  the company does plan to annually reduce its debt to total capitalization leverage by one to two percentage points over the next few years through selected asset sales  free cash flow and increased equity from retained earnings and ongoing equity issuances

interest payments on long term debt and interest rate derivatives are based on the interest rate effective as of december   and the libor forward curve as of december   respectively 
c 
fuel and purchased power commitments represent the majority of the company s remaining future commitments after its debt obligations 
essentially all of the company s fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through pass through clauses in accordance with north carolina  south carolina and florida regulations and therefore do not require separate liquidity support

in  pec must begin transitioning amounts currently retained internally to its external decommissioning funds 
the transition of million must be complete by december   and at least must be transitioned each year 
e 
the company has certain future commitments related to four synthetic fuel facilities purchased that provide for contingent payments royalties through see note b 
other matters synthetic fuels tax credits the company has substantial operations associated with the production of coal based synthetic fuels 
the production and sale of these products qualifies for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements are satisfied 
these operations are subject to numerous risks 
although the company believes that it operates its synthetic fuel facilities in compliance with applicable legal requirements for claiming the credits  its four earthco facilities are under audit by the irs 
irs field auditors have taken an adverse position with respect to the company s compliance with one of these legal requirements  and if the company fails to prevail with respect to this position  it could incur significant liability and or lose the ability to claim the benefit of tax credits carried forward or generated in the future 
similarly  the financial accounting standards board may issue new accounting rules that would require that uncertain tax benefits such as those associated with the earthco plants be probable of being sustained in order to be recorded on the financial statements  if adopted  this provision could have an adverse financial impact on the company 
the company s ability to utilize tax credits is dependent on having sufficient tax liability 
any conditions that negatively impact the company s tax liability  such as weather  could also diminish the company s ability to utilize credits  including those previously generated  and the synthetic fuel is generally not economical to produce absent the credits 
finally  the tax credits associated with synthetic fuels may be phased out if market prices for crude oil exceed certain prices 
the company s synthetic fuel operations and related risks are described in more detail in note e and in the risk factors section 
hurricane costs hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne struck significant portions of the company s service territories during the third quarter of  significantly impacting pef s territory 
as of december   restoration of the company s systems from hurricane related damage was estimated at million 
pec incurred restoration costs of million  of which million was charged to operation and maintenance expense and million was charged to capital expenditures 
pef had estimated total costs of million  of which million was charged to capital expenditures  and million was charged to the storm damage reserve pursuant to a regulatory order 
in accordance with a regulatory order  pef accrues million annually to a storm damage reserve and is allowed to defer losses in excess of the accumulated reserve for major storms 
under the order  the storm reserve is charged with operation and maintenance expenses related to storm restoration and with capital expenditures related to storm restoration that are in excess of expenditures assuming normal operating conditions 
as of december   million of hurricane restoration costs in excess of the previously recorded storm reserve of million had been classified as a regulatory asset recognizing the probable recoverability of these costs 
on november   pef filed a petition with the fpsc to recover million of storm costs plus interest from retail ratepayers over a two year period 
storm reserve costs of million were attributable to wholesale customers 
the company has received approval from the ferc to amortize these costs consistent with recovery of such amounts in wholesale rates 
pef continues to review the restoration cost invoices received 
given that not all invoices have been received as of december   pef will update its petition with the fpsc upon receipt and audit of all actual charges incurred 
hearings on pef s petition for recovery of million of storm costs filed with the fpsc are scheduled to begin on march  on november   the citizens of the state of florida  by and through harold mclean  public counsel  and the florida industrial power users group fipug  collectively  joint movants  filed a motion to dismiss pef s petition to recover the million in storm costs 
on november   pef responded in opposition to the motion  which was also the fpsc staff s position in its recommendation to the commission on december   that it should deny the motion to dismiss 
on january   the commission ruled in favor of pef and denied the joint movant s motion to dismiss 
pef s january notice to the fpsc of its intent to file for an increase in its base rates effective january   anticipates the need to replenish the depleted storm reserve balance and adjust the annual million accrual in light of recent storm history to restore the reserve to an adequate level over a reasonable time period 
pec does not have an ongoing regulatory mechanism to recover storm costs  therefore  hurricane restoration costs recorded in the third quarter of were charged to operations and maintenance expenses or capital expenditures based on the nature of the work performed 
in connection with other storms  pec has previously sought and received permission from the ncuc and the scpsc to defer storm expenses and amortize them over a five year period 
pec did not seek deferral of storm costs from the ncuc see note b 
regulatory environment and matters the company s electric utility operations in north carolina  south carolina and florida are regulated by the ncuc  the public service commission of south carolina scpsc and the fpsc  respectively 
the electric businesses are also subject to regulation by the ferc  the nrc and other federal and state agencies common to the utility business 
in addition  the company is subject to sec regulation as a registered holding company under puhca 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions  as well as the rate of return the electric utilities are permitted to earn  are subject to the approval of governmental agencies 
pec and pef continue to monitor any developments toward a more competitive environment and have actively participated in regulatory reform deliberations in north carolina  south carolina and florida 
movement toward deregulation in these states has been affected by recent developments  including developments related to deregulation of the electric industry in other states 
the company expects the legislatures in all three states will continue to monitor the experiences of states that have implemented electric restructuring legislation 
the company cannot anticipate when  or if  any of these states will move to increase competition in the electric industry 
the retail rate matters affected by the regulatory authorities are discussed in detail in notes b and c 
this discussion identifies specific retail rate matters  the status of the issues and the associated effects to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the regulatory authorities continue to evaluate issues related to the formation of regional transmission organizations 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters on the company s earnings  revenues or prices or the investments in gridsouth and gridflorida see note d 
a ferc order issued in november on certain unaffiliated utilities triennial market based wholesale power rate authorization updates required certain mitigation actions that those utilities would need to take for sales purchases within their control areas and required those utilities to post information on their web sites regarding their power systems status 
as a result of a request for rehearing filed by certain market participants  ferc issued an order delaying the effective date of the mitigation plan until after a planned technical conference on market power determination 
in december  the ferc issued a staff paper discussing alternatives and held a technical conference in january in april  the ferc issued two orders concerning utilities ability to sell wholesale electricity at market based rates 
in the first order  the ferc adopted two new interim screens for assessing potential generation market power of applicants for wholesale market based rates  and described additional analyses and mitigation measures that could be presented if an applicant does not pass one of these interim screens 
in july  the ferc issued an order on rehearing affirming its conclusions in the april order 
in the second order  the ferc initiated a rulemaking to consider whether the ferc s current methodology for determining whether a public utility should be allowed to sell wholesale electricity at market based rates should be modified in any way 
pef does not have market based rate authority for wholesale sales in peninsular florida 
given the difficulty pec believes it would experience in passing one of the interim screens  on august   pec notified the ferc that it would revise its market based rate tariff to restrict it to sales outside pec s control area and file a new cost based tariff for sales within pec s control area that incorporates the ferc s default cost based rate methodologies for sales of one year or less 
pec anticipates making this filing in the first quarter of although the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these changes  the company does not anticipate that the current operations of pec or pef would be impacted materially if they were unable to sell power at market based rates in their respective control areas 
franchise litigation three cities  with a total of approximately  customers  have litigation pending against pef in various circuit courts in florida 
as previously reported  three other cities  with a total of approximately  customers  have subsequently settled their lawsuits with pef and signed new  year franchise agreements 
the lawsuits principally seek a declaratory judgment that the cities have the right to purchase pef s electric distribution system located within the municipal boundaries of the cities  a declaratory judgment that the value of the distribution system must be determined through arbitration  and injunctive relief requiring pef to continue to collect from pef s customers  and remit to the cities  franchise fees during the pending litigation  and as long as pef continues to occupy the cities rights of way to provide electric service  notwithstanding the expiration of the franchise ordinances under which pef had agreed to collect such fees 
the circuit courts in those cases have entered orders requiring arbitration to establish the purchase price of pef s electric distribution system within five cities 
two appellate courts have upheld those circuit court decisions and authorized the cities to determine the value of pef s electric distribution system within the cities through arbitration 
arbitration in one of the cases with the  customer city of winter park was completed in february that arbitration panel issued an award in may setting the value of pef s distribution system within the city of winter park the city at approximately million  not including separation and reintegration and construction work in progress  which could add several million dollars to the award 
the panel also awarded pef approximately million in stranded costs  which  according to the award  decrease over time 
in september  winter park voters passed a referendum that would authorize the city to issue bonds of up to approximately million to acquire pef s electric distribution system 
while the city has not yet definitively decided whether it will acquire the system  on april   the city commission voted to proceed with the acquisition 
the city sought and received wholesale power supply bids and on june   executed a wholesale power supply contract with pef 
on may   the city solicited bids to operate and maintain the distribution system and awarded a contract in january the city has indicated that its goal is to begin electric operations in june on february   pef filed a petition with the florida public service commission to relieve the company of its statutory obligation to serve customers in winter park on june   or at such time when the city is able to provide retail service 
at this time  whether and when there will be further proceedings regarding the city of winter park cannot be determined 
arbitration with the  customer town of belleair was completed in june in september  the arbitration panel issued an award in that case setting the value of the electric distribution system within the town at approximately million 
the panel further required the town to pay to pef its requested million in separation and reintegration costs and million in stranded costs 
the town has not yet decided whether it will attempt to acquire the system  however  on january   it issued a request for proposals for wholesale power supply and to operate and maintain the distribution system 
proposals are due in early march in february  the town commission also voted to put the issue of whether to acquire the distribution system to a voter referendum on or before october  at this time  whether and when there will be further proceedings regarding the town of belleair cannot be determined 
arbitration in the remaining city s litigation the  customer city of edgewood has not yet been scheduled 
on february   the parties filed a joint motion to stay the litigation for a day period during which the parties will discuss potential settlement 
a fourth city the  customer city of maitland is contemplating municipalization and has indicated its intent to proceed with arbitration to determine the value of pef s electric distribution system within the city 
maitland s franchise expires in august at this time  whether and when there will be further proceedings regarding the city of maitland cannot be determined 
as part of the above litigation  two appellate courts reached opposite conclusions regarding whether pef must continue to collect from its customers and remit to the cities franchise fees under the expired franchise ordinances 
pef filed an appeal with the florida supreme court to resolve the conflict between the two appellate courts 
on october   the court issued a decision holding that pef must collect from its customers and remit to the cities franchise fees during the interim period when the city exercises its purchase option or executes a new franchise 
the court s decision should not have a material impact on the company

liquidity and capital resources overview pec has primarily used a combination of unsecured notes  first mortgage bonds  pollution control bonds  commercial paper facilities and revolving credit agreements for liquidity needs in excess of cash provided by operations 
during  pec extended its million day line of credit to july  and pec s three year million line of credit expires july  as discussed above in the progress energy overview  in october  s p reduced the short term debt rating of pec to a from a as a result of the impact of these actions on pec s ability to access the commercial paper markets  pec has borrowed on its revolving credit agreements 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding borrowings on pec s revolving credit agreements was million

to date  pec s access to the commercial paper markets has not been materially impacted by the rating agencies actions 
however  the changes have increased the interest rate incurred on its short term borrowings by to 
pec expects to have sufficient resources to meet its future obligations either through internally generated funds  its short term term borrowing facilities or through the issuance of long term debt 
historical for as compared to and as compared to in  cash provided by operating activities decreased when compared to the decrease was caused primarily by a million under recovery of fuel costs and a million decrease in payables to affiliates 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased when compared to  largely as a result of improved operating results 
in  cash used in investing activities decreased approximately million in when compared with the decrease is primarily to net proceeds from short term investments in  compared to net purchases in the decrease is partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures  primarily related to increased spending for nc clean air legislation  and an increase in nuclear fuel additions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk progress energy  inc market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
certain market risks are inherent in the company s financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the company s primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to its long term debt and commercial paper  and fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to its nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
the company manages its market risk in accordance with its established risk management policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with the company s operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risks through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
variable rate debt has rates that adjust in periods ranging from daily to monthly 
interest rate derivative instruments may be used to adjust interest rate exposures and to protect against adverse movements in rates 
the following tables provide information at december  and  about the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and fpc obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates for and thereafter and the fair value of the related hedges 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps and the settlement amounts under the interest rate forward contracts

b rate is month libor  which was at december  c notional amount is varying with a maximum of million  decreasing to million after december marketable securities price risk the company s electric utility subsidiaries maintain trust funds  pursuant to nrc requirements  to fund certain costs of decommissioning their nuclear plants 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of these funds was billion and million at december  and  respectively 
the company actively monitors its portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the company s regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings  and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect the earnings of the company 
contingent value obligations market value risk in connection with the acquisition of fpc  the company issued million cvos 
each cvo represents the right to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuel facilities purchased by subsidiaries of fpc in october the payments  if any  are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
these cvos are recorded at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
at december  and  the fair value of these cvos was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in the december   market price would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the cvos 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  electricity and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
the company s exposure to these fluctuations is significantly limited by the cost based regulation of pec and pef 
each state commission allows electric utilities to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines that such costs are prudent 
therefore  while there may be a delay in the timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered from the ratepayers  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results 
in addition  many of the company s long term power sales contracts shift substantially all fuel responsibility to the purchaser 
the company also has oil price risk exposure related to synfuel tax credits 
see discussion in note e 
the company uses natural gas hedging instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the future sales price of the company s natural gas 
in addition  the company may engage in limited economic hedging activity using natural gas and electricity financial instruments 
in  pef entered into derivative instruments related to its exposure to price fluctuations on fuel oil purchases 
at december   the fair values of these instruments were a million long term derivative asset position included in other assets and deferred debits and a million short term derivative liability position included in other current liabilities 
these instruments receive regulatory accounting treatment 
gains are recorded in regulatory liabilities and losses are recorded in regulatory assets
