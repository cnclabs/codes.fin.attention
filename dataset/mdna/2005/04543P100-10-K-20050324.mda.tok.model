com are to the nilson report  issue  dated july  and issue  dated march overview company overview we have been purchasing and collecting defaulted or charged off accounts receivable portfolios from consumer credit originators since the formation of our predecessor company in charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers  consumer finance companies  retail merchants and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we are able to purchase them at a substantial discount 
unlike many of our competitors  we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this affords us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize our profits 
we currently do not collect on a commission or contingent fee basis 
during  cash collections increased to million 
revenues for were million  a increase over the prior year 
net income was million for  compared to million for net income in includes a million compensation charge million on an after tax basis for the vesting of outstanding share appreciation rights and a deferred tax charge of million 
during  we invested million in charged off consumer receivable portfolios  with an aggregate face value of billion  or of face value 
we have seen prices for charged off accounts receivable portfolios increase over the past to months and believe prices to be relatively high at the current time 
although we cannot give any assurances that prices will stabilize  we are determined to remain disciplined and purchase portfolios only when we believe we can achieve acceptable returns 
we regularly utilize unaffiliated third parties  primarily attorneys and other collection agencies  to collect certain account balances on our behalf 
the percent of gross collections from such third parties has steadily increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increased activity in states that we are not located in  but does not reflect any specific strategy to increase third party collections 
during the fourth quarter of  we moved to a new corporate headquarters located in warren  michigan 
the new building lease has a term of months and future contractual cash obligations of million 
additionally  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures related to our new corporate headquarters 
on march   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for a secondary public offering of  shares of our common stock 
all of these shares will be offered by selling stockholders  which include members of management and other holders  and none of the shares will be offered by us 
in addition  certain of the selling stockholders also intend to grant the underwriters an over allotment option to purchase up to an additional  shares 
the selling stockholders will receive all of the net proceeds from the sale of the shares 
as of the date of the filling of this annual report  we do not know whether we will be successful in consummating this secondary offering or  if successful  when it will be consummated 
pursuant to the terms of our registration rights agreement with aac quad c investors llc  mr

in addition  certain of the selling stockholders  pursuant to the registration rights agreement  retain the right to request the registration of specified shares  in which case we will be required to bear such offering expenses in the quarter in which any future offering occurs 
industry overview the accounts receivable management industry is growing  driven by a number of industry trends  including increasing levels of consumer debt obligations according to the us federal reserve board  the consumer credit industry increased from billion of consumer debt obligations in to trillion of consumer debt obligations in november  a compound annual growth rate of 
the nilson report projects that this market will increase to trillion by increasing charge offs of the underlying receivables according to the nilson report  net charge offs of credit card debt have increased from billion in to billion in  a compound annual growth rate of 
the nilson report is forecasting an increase in the net charge offs of credit card debt to billion in increasing types of credit originators accessing the debt sale market according to the nilson report  the cost for all types of purchased debt sold has increased from billion in to billion in  a compound annual growth rate of 
charged off credit card debt averaged of sales for the three year period through compared to for the three year period through sellers of charged off portfolios have expanded to include healthcare  utility and telecommunications providers  commercial banks  consumer finance companies  retail merchants and mortgage and auto finance companies 
historically  credit originators have sought to limit credit losses either through using internal collection efforts with their own personnel or outsourcing collection activities to third party collectors 
credit originators that outsource the collection of charged off receivables have typically remained committed to third party providers as a result of the perceived economic benefit of outsourcing and the resources required to establish the infrastructure required to support in house collection efforts 
the credit originator can pursue an outsourced solution by either selling its charged off receivables for immediate cash proceeds or by placing charged off receivables with a third party collector on a contingent fee basis while retaining ownership of the receivables 
in the event that a credit originator sells receivables to a debt purchaser such as us  the credit originator receives immediate cash proceeds and eliminates the costs and risks associated with internal recovery operations 
the purchase price for these charged off receivables typically ranges from one to ten percent of the face amount of the receivables  depending on the amount the purchaser anticipates it can recover and the anticipated effort required to recover that amount 
credit originators  as well as other holders of consumer debt  utilize a variety of processes to sell receivables  including the following competitive bids for specified portfolios through a sealed bid or  in some cases  an on line process  privately negotiated transactions between the credit originator or other holder of consumer debt and a purchaser  and forward flow contracts  which commit a debt seller to sell  and a purchaser to acquire  a steady flow of charged off consumer receivables periodically over a specified period of time  usually no less than three months  for a fixed percentage of the face amount of the receivables 
we believe a debt purchaser s ability to successfully collect payments on charged off receivables  despite previous collection efforts by the credit originator or third party collection agencies  is driven by several factors  including the purchaser s ability to pursue collections over multi year periods

history and reorganization our chairman s expertise and experience in purchasing and collecting charged off consumer receivables dates back to when he formed lee acceptance company as a sole proprietorship 
our chief executive officer joined lee acceptance company in in  lee acceptance company was incorporated as lee acceptance corp 
the business of purchasing and collecting charged off consumer receivables was subsequently conducted by our chairman and our chief executive officer through several successor companies 
in  our chairman and our chief executive officer formed asset acceptance corp

table of contents seasonality our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections within portfolios tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections within portfolios tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
our historical growth in purchased portfolios and in our resultant quarterly cash collections has helped to minimize the effect of seasonal cash collections 
operating expenses are seasonally higher during the first and second quarters of the year due to expenses necessary to process the increase in cash collections 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level due to the application of the interest method for revenue recognition 
in addition  our operating results may be affected to a lesser extent by the timing of purchases of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with purchasing and integrating these receivables into our system 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
below is a chart that illustrates our quarterly collections for years through quarterly cash collections graph cash collections quarter first second third fourth 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of cash have been from operations and bank borrowings

there was no outstanding balance on our line of credit at december  at december   we had a note payable outstanding to a related party totaling million including principal and accrued interest 
during february  we used million of the proceeds from our initial public offering to pay our related party debt in full 
cash flows the majority of our purchases have been funded with internal cash flow 
for the year ended december   we invested million in purchased receivables  net of buybacks  while our balance under our line of credit decreased by million  including the payment of million from the proceeds of our initial public offering

cash paid for interest consisted of million for the line of credit and million paid for the related party debt for the year ended december  we believe that cash generated from operations combined with borrowing available under our line of credit  should be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in the future  if we need additional capital for investment in purchased receivables  working capital or to grow our business or acquire other businesses  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or we may seek to increase the availability under our line of credit 
new corporate headquarters we relocated to our new corporate headquarters in warren  michigan during the fourth quarter of our new headquarters is in a  square foot building that we believe provides sufficient room for growth  accommodating up to approximately  employees 
as of december   we had approximately employees occupying the new corporate headquarters 
the lease was entered into in october and commenced in december with an annual base rent expense of approximately million compared to approximately  for our previous headquarters 
we expect operating net costs for the new building to decrease because newer buildings require less maintenance and we will receive abatements of most real and personal property taxes due to the building s location in a renaissance zone 
michigan single business taxes are also abated to the extent our business activities are located in the renaissance zone 
the tax abatements will expire in with a three year phase out period beginning in we invested approximately million in capital expenditures related to our new corporate headquarters  primarily during the fourth quarter of it is possible that some of the capital expenditures may be reimbursed based on certain contingent events

four of the contracts have terms beyond with the last contract expiring november two of the contracts call for monthly purchases of between  and  depending upon circumstances  and the other two have unspecified minimum and maximum contractual amounts 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
internal revenue code section p and related treasury regulations internal revenue code section p and the related treasury regulations  in certain circumstances  require creditors to send out form c information returns to those debtors whose debt  in an amount in excess of  has been deemed to have been forgiven for tax purposes  thereby alerting them to the amount of the forgiveness and the fact that such amount may be taxable income to them 
under these regulations  a debt is deemed to have been forgiven for tax purposes if i there has been no payment on the debt for months and if there were no bona fide collection activities as defined in the regulation for the preceding month period  ii the debt was settled for less than the full amount or iii other similar situations outlined in the regulations 
us treasury regulation section p became final in and is effective for and forward and indicates that the rules apply to companies who acquire indebtedness and  therefore  we will need to comply with the reporting requirements 
our cost of compliance with these regulations is uncertain 
in some instances  we may engage in additional monitoring activities of accounts and will send c information returns  which will increase our administrative costs 
if we are required to send a c information return  despite the fact that we are continuing our collections efforts on an account  it may become more difficult to collect from those accounts because debtors may perceive the c as notice of debt relief rather than as tax information 
this mistaken perception may lead to increased litigation costs for us as we may need to overcome affirmative defenses and counterclaims based on this belief by certain debtors 
in addition  we may be required to modify our historical collection practices to conform to the regulation s definition of bona fide collection practices which could increase our costs to monitor accounts and manage our collection activities 
penalties for failure to comply with these regulations are per instance  with a maximum penalty of  per year  except where failure is due to intentional disregard  for which penalties are per instance  with no maximum penalty 
an additional penalty of per information return  with no annual maximum  applies for a failure to provide the statement to the recipient 
critical accounting policies we utilize the interest method of accounting for our purchased receivables because we believe that the amounts and timing of cash collections for our purchased receivables can be reasonably estimated 
this belief is predicated on our historical results and our knowledge of the industry 
the interest method is prescribed by the accounting standards executive committee practice bulletin pb  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans as well as the accounting standards executive committee statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the provisions of sop were adopted by us in january and apply to purchased receivables acquired after december  the provisions of sop that relate to decreases in expected cash flows apply prospectively to receivables acquired before january  other than the provisions relating to decreases in expected cash flow  purchased receivables acquired before january  will continue to be accounted for under pb each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an internal rate of return irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows and applied to the balance of the static pool 
the resulting revenue recognized is based on the irr applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
to the extent there are differences in actual performance versus expected performance  the irr is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
beginning in january  under sop  if the revised estimate of cash flows is less than the original estimate  the irr will remain unchanged and an immediate impairment will be recognized 

table of contents application of the interest method of accounting requires the use of estimates to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than projected cash collections  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected cash collections will have a favorable impact on yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected cash collections will have an unfavorable impact and result in an immediate impairment being recorded 
for  every basis point change in the average yields for all pools would have affected year to date revenue by approximately million or 
a full percentage point change basis points in the average irr for all pools would have affected year to date revenue by approximately million or

r requires all stock based compensation awards granted to employees be recognized in the financial statements at fair value  similar to that prescribed under sfas no

sop  accounting for certain loans of debt securities acquired in a transfer in december  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans of debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
sop requires us to use the interest method of accounting for our purchased receivables similar to the guidance in practice bulletin pb 
under both the guidance of pb and sop  when expected cash flows are higher than prior projections  the increase in expected cash flows results in an increase in the irr and therefore  the effect of the cash flow increase is recognized as increased revenue prospectively over the remaining life of the affected pool 
however  when expected cash flows are lower than prior projections  sop requires that the expected decrease be recognized as an immediate impairment by decreasing the carrying value of the affected pool rather than lowering the irr so that the pool will amortize over its expected life using the original irr 
prior to  under pb  a decrease in expected cash flows resulted in a reduction of the irr and therefore  the effect of the cash flow reduction was recognized as lower revenue prospectively over the remaining life of the affected pool 
the amount of total revenue recognized over the approximate month life of each pool is identical under both pb and sop  however  the timing could differ
