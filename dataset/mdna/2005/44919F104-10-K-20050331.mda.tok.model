item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business overview hythiam  inc is a development stage healthcare services management company  focused on delivering solutions for those suffering from alcoholism and other substance dependencies 
we research  develop  license and commercialize innovative physiological treatment protocols for substance dependence 
our hands protocols are designed for use by healthcare providers to treat those diagnosed with dependence to alcohol  cocaine  methamphetamine  as well as combinations of these drugs 
specifically  there are two hands protocols the hands protocol for alcohol dependence and the hands protocol for stimulant dependence or combined dependence to alcohol and stimulants 
changes in the neurochemistry of the brain underlie the hallmarks of substance dependence  including craving  tolerance  withdrawal symptoms and relapse 
the hands protocols include medically supervised procedures designed to target receptor sites in the brain that regulate neurotransmitters implicated in brain processes of substance dependence 
the hands protocols also provide for a maintenance program that includes medications and incentives for patients to continue with their recovery process through individualized continuing care programs 
as a result  our hands protocols represent a comprehensive approach to managing substance dependence that is designed to address both the physiological and psychological aspects of the disease  thereby offering patients an opportunity to transition into a healthier lifestyle 
we generate revenues by charging fees to licensed healthcare providers for access to our proprietary protocols for use in treating their patients 
we also provide proprietary administrative services to assist physicians and facilities with staff education  marketing and sales support  and outcomes tracking for data analysis 
we intend to provide leased space and management services to a physician practice in under a management services contract with an affiliated physician group 
we have been unprofitable since our inception and may incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next twelve months as we incur expenditures on research and development  implement commercial operations and allocate significant and increasing resources to sales  marketing and other start up activities 
accordingly  our activities to date are not as broad in depth or scope as the activities we may undertake in the future  and our historical operations and financial information are not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition or ability to operate profitably as a commercial enterprise 
we do not currently operate our own healthcare facilities  employ our own treating physicians or provide medical advice or treatment to patients 
the hospitals  licensed healthcare facilities  and physicians that contract for the use of our technology own their facility or professional license and control and are responsible for the clinical activities provided on their premises 
following the treatment procedure  local clinics and healthcare providers specializing in drug abuse treatment administer and provide aftercare treatment 
patients receive medical care in accordance with orders from their attending physicians 
each physician with license rights to use the hands protocols is responsible for exercising their own independent medical judgment in determining the specific application of our protocols  and the appropriate course of care for each patient 
no employment relationship currently exists between us and the attending physicians who treat patients using our protocols 
in the course of performing our administrative duties  we may bill and collect funds from patients on behalf of the healthcare provider  and  in accordance with directions from the providers  disburse a portion of that money to the facility and or to the attending physician for professional services rendered 

table of contents we believe that the structure of our business and operations as outlined above will be in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
however  the healthcare industry is highly regulated  and the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation by various federal and state legislatures  courts  and enforcement and regulatory authorities 
our commercial viability is therefore subject to the legal and regulatory risks outlined in the risk factors section of this report 
background on substance dependence substance dependence disorders comprise a worldwide public health problem that affects many people and has wide ranging social consequences 
in  an estimated million americans suffered from substance dependence or abuse due to drugs  alcohol or both  according to the national survey on drug use and health published by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa in the us department of health and human services 
summarizing data from the office of national drug control policy ondcp and the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa  the economic cost of alcohol and drug abuse exceeds billion annually in the us  of which the health care component is over billion and productivity losses account for approximately billion 
in comparison  the national cancer institute estimates that million americans suffer from cancer  and the centers for disease control report on the health burden of chronic diseases projects the economic cost of cancer in to total more than billion  consisting of over billion in direct medical costs  and over billion for indirect costs such as lost productivity 
historically  the disease of substance dependence has been treated primarily through behavioral intervention  with fairly high relapse rates 
samhsa reports that only of those treated for alcoholism and of those treated for cocaine and other stimulants complete the detoxification procedure 
samhsa s drug and alcohol services information system states that treatment completion rates in for outpatient treatment were only for alcohol and for cocaine 
for patients who do complete treatment  the niaaa reports relapse rates three months following treatment for alcohol dependence to be 
for the treatment of cocaine dependence  the drug abuse treatment outcome survey datos reports a relapse rate of one year following days or less of outpatient treatment and one year following days or less of long term residential treatment 
those suffering from alcohol and or drug dependence have often been characterized as having social disorders or a lack of self discipline and  as noted above  there are relatively high relapse rates utilizing conventional treatment methodologies 
while we believe the psychological approach to substance dependence treatment is important  we recognize that physiological factors should be addressed first to provide the patient the best chance for recovery 
we believe our physiological approach  focused on addressing the neurochemical imbalances in the brain caused or worsened by substance dependence  provides a substantial commercial opportunity 
substance dependence as a disease recent scientific research provides evidence that not only can drugs interfere with normal brain functioning but can also have long lasting effects that persist even after the drug is no longer being used 
at some point  changes may occur in the brain that can turn drug and alcohol abuse into substance dependence  a chronic  relapsing and sometimes fatal disease 
those dependent on drugs may suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and be unable to quit by themselves 
professional medical treatment is often necessary to end this physiologically based compulsive behavior 
we believe that the ability to successfully treat the physiological basis of substance dependence can improve treatment outcome  reduce the cost of treating dependence  and reduce cost to society of managing adverse consequences of alcohol and drug abuse  decreasing related criminality and violence  and reducing the costs associated with high risk behavior 
according to niaaa  of all deaths due to liver cirrhosis are alcohol related  with most of these deaths occurring in people to years old 
one study found that to of all emergency room trauma cases involve alcohol use roizen  j  alcohol and trauma  
another study evaluated the incidence of cardiomyopathy in asymptomatic alcoholic men  finding that exhibited evidence of cardiomyopathy rubin  e  the effects of alcoholism on skeletal and cardiac muscle  

table of contents the consequences of alcoholism and alcohol abuse affect most american families 
one study estimated that of all injury related hospital admissions are the result of alcoholism or alcohol problems waller j  diagnosis of alcoholism in the injured patient  
according to the national commission against drunk driving  nearly  americans are injured in alcohol related traffic crashes each year  resulting in  fatalities 
cocaine and crack use place a heavy load upon our criminal justice system 
according to a bureau of justice statistics bulletin  prisoners in  published in august  approximately of the million state and of the  federal prisoners were convicted of drug offenses 
the ondcp reports that over of all arrestees test positive for cocaine or crack 
in  over of all federal defendants were charged with cocaine crack drug offenses 
the consequences of cocaine and crack use extend beyond the criminal justice system 
the national institute on drug abuse nida reports the medical complications of cocaine use to include heart arrhythmias and heart attacks  chest pain and respiratory failure  strokes  seizures  and headaches  as well as abdominal pain and nausea 
nida also notes that there have been no medications available to treat cocaine dependence 
methamphetamine abuse is now recognized as a major problem in the us the national survey on drug use and health reports that approximately million americans ages and older reported trying methamphetamine at least once during their lifetimes  representing of the population ages and older  an increase from just under of the adult population in according to the ondcp december  publication  what america s users spend on illegal drugs  there was a significant increase in methamphetamine users during the last decade 
in the number of chronic users was reported to be  more than double the  users reported in findings from the drug and alcohol services information system dasis report published by the office of applied studies  samhsa  in september  show that methamphetamine hospital admissions have increased from in to in according to a nida research report methamphetamine abuse and addiction january  the effects of methamphetamine use can include addiction  psychotic behavior  and brain damage 
methamphetamine is highly addictive and users trying to abstain from use may suffer withdrawal symptoms that include depression  anxiety  fatigue  paranoia  aggression  and intense cravings for the drug 
chronic methamphetamine use can cause violent behavior  anxiety  confusion  and insomnia 
users can also exhibit psychotic behavior including auditory hallucinations  mood disturbances  delusions  and paranoia  possibly resulting in homicidal or suicidal thoughts 
according to nida s report methamphetamine linked to long term damage to brain cells march  use of methamphetamine can cause damage to the brain that is detectable months after the use of the drug 
the damage to the brain caused by methamphetamine use is similar to damage caused by alzheimer s disease  stroke  and epilepsy 
development of the company we have acquired  licensed and developed proprietary  patented and patent pending treatment protocols designed to treat the physiological component of the disease of substance dependence 
our first such proprietary technology  the hands protocols  are designed for those diagnosed with dependencies to alcohol  cocaine  methamphetamine  or a combination of these drugs 
specifically  there are two hands protocols the hands protocol for alcohol dependence and the hands protocol for stimulant dependence or combined dependence to alcohol and stimulants 
the hands protocols are medically supervised procedures designed to correct the neurochemical imbalances and alteration in brain neuroreceptors induced or made worse by chronic heavy use of alcohol or stimulant drugs 
the protocols provide for nutritional supplementation  one month of pharmacotherapy  and incentives for patients to participate in psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy of their choice 
the hands protocols are designed to minimize withdrawal symptoms  reduce cravings  and provide patients with aftercare support as they progress through the recovery process 
initiation of the hands protocols offers the convenience of a to day treatment 
in summary  the hands protocols represent a medically supervised approach to treatment rooted in the belief that by addressing the underlying physiologic aspects of substance dependence  dependent persons may be afforded an opportunity to better address the behavioral and environmental components of their disease 
retrospective data collected from patients treated with the hands protocols at our first us licensee treatment center suggest promising results in terms of treatment completion rates  abstinence rates and reduction of cravings based on patient follow up ranging from three to twelve months post treatment 
these limited initial results were not obtained by formal research studies  may not be statistically significant  have not been subjected to detailed scientific scrutiny  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance of our protocols 
we are currently in the process of awarding unrestricted grants for research studies of our protocols to generate data on the efficacy of the protocols 
plan of operation during our initial development stage we have focused on raising capital to fund our development activities  complete the hiring of our senior management team and supporting staff  and the build out  furnishing and equipping of our corporate offices 
we plan to continue to invest in the needed infrastructure  both in management as well as systems and equipment  to develop  market and implement our business plan 
throughout the remainder of the year we will increase our staff  purchase equipment and develop information systems to support new treatment sites which license our hands protocols 

table of contents over the coming year  we will continue to implement commercial operations  commence substantial marketing activities  and allocate significant and increasing resources to sales and marketing 
we have entered into agreements with fourteen hospitals and licensed healthcare providers to date  of which twelve were signed in the last six months and are in various stages of training and start up 
our licensees treated patients in  including in the fourth quarter 
little company of mary san pedro hospital in southern california treated of these patients  in the fourth quarter 
we intend to enter into agreements with additional hospitals and other healthcare providers to increase both geographic penetration and the number of patients treated 
as revenues are generally related to the number of patients treated  key indicators of our financial performance will be the number of facilities and healthcare providers that license our technology  and the number of patients that are treated by those providers using our hands protocols 
our protocols are not currently approved for payment by any health insurance company or third party payor 
to date  patients treated with the hands protocol have been substantially private pay patients 
our plan is to apply our technology to an existing industry we view as fragmented with participants that include healthcare providers such as physicians  psychologists  nurses  therapists  interventionists  counselors  hospitals  residential treatment centers  outpatient treatment facilities  and self help groups 
over time  we expect patients to be referred for treatment by physicians and treatment centers using our technology and through self referrals  patients family members  friends  employers and associated unions  as well as employee assistance programs  criminal justice systems  healthcare providers  third party payors  and government agencies 
we believe that the hands protocols can provide a significant improvement to current treatment methodologies by addressing a spectrum of patient needs  including both physiological and psychological elements of substance dependence 
us market opportunity the us market consists of a broad spectrum of people who are addicted to or have cravings for alcohol  psychostimulants eg  cocaine  crack  methamphetamine  crystal meth  speed  tranquilizers and opiates eg  heroin  morphine  codeine  methadone  vicodin  oxycontin  darvon  dilaudid  demerol 
in  an estimated million americans suffered from substance dependence or abuse due to drugs  alcohol or both  according to samhsa 
according to the report  only million individuals aged twelve or over received some kind of treatment 
further  according to niaaa  approximately of people treated for alcohol dependence relapse within three months 
relapse rates are higher for those suffering from cocaine dependence as opposed to alcohol 
the datos reports cocaine relapse rates of after one year for those undergoing days or less of outpatient drug free treatment 
for those undergoing days or less of long term residential treatment  relapse rates were at one year post treatment 
there are currently no effective pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine or cocaine dependence 
development and acquisition of our technology much of our proprietary  patented and patent pending substance dependence technology  currently known as the hands protocols  was developed by dr 
juan jos legarda  a european scientist educated at the university of london who has spent most of his professional career conducting research related to substance abuse 
through his studies and research  dr 
legarda discovered the adverse physical effects of substance abuse on the brain and began to develop technologies that specifically focused on the neurochemistry of the brain as a core part of addictive behavior modification 
in  dr 
legarda filed patent cooperation treaty pct applications in spain for treatment protocols that he developed for dependencies to alcohol and cocaine  which remain pending 
we acquired the rights to these patent filings in march through a technology purchase and license agreement with dr 
legarda s company  tratamientos avanzados de la adiccion sl subsequent to acquiring these rights  we filed sl patent applications based on the prior pct filings  as well as provisional us patent applications for additional treatment protocols for alcohol  cocaine and other addictive stimulants 
if these patents are issued  they will expire years from the dates of original filing 
these issued and pending patents and ongoing improvements we continue to research and develop comprise our technology known as the hands protocols 

table of contents our innovative medically supervised treatment options studies published by the national institute on drug abuse nida and national institute on alcoholism and alcohol abuse niaaa illustrate the neurochemical and physical changes to the brain wrought by chronic alcohol and drug abuse and dependence 
while treating the psychological component of the disease is important  we recognize that physiological factors of substance dependence should be addressed first to provide patients with an improved chance for recovery 
the hands protocols are innovative medically supervised treatment programs for the treatment of alcohol and or stimulant dependencies 
specifically  there are two hands protocols the hands protocol for alcohol dependence and the hands protocol for stimulant dependence or combined dependence to alcohol and stimulants 
the protocols are designed for use by healthcare providers to treat those diagnosed with dependence to alcohol  cocaine  and methamphetamine  as well as combinations of these drugs  by targeting neurochemical imbalances in the brain that have been caused or worsened by chronic exposure to alcohol and or stimulants 
the hands protocols involve administration of pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplementation in a medically supervised setting which is initiated over a period of to consecutive days 
the hands protocol for stimulant dependence or combination stimulant and alcohol dependence also provides for a second medically supervised procedure of consecutive days about weeks after the initial treatment 
an initial assessment is done prior to beginning the hands protocol 
the hands protocol includes a comprehensive medical exam along with orally and intravenously administered medications and nutritional supplements 
the intravenous treatment sessions typically last about hours 
while there may be mild discomfort from preparing and removing the iv for intravenous administration of medications  the hands protocols are designed to ensure that the patient is as comfortable as possible throughout the medically supervised procedures 
the hands protocols are designed to minimize patient sedation 
some of the medications in the treatment regimen may cause temporary drowsiness 
for those patients who receive their treatment in a hospital  or inpatient setting  the balance of time spent at the treatment facility is intended to ensure that the patient is well rested and comfortable between the relatively short treatment periods 
many patients take meals and choose to sleep much of the time between treatments 
for those patients receiving care in an outpatient facility  the hands treating physician monitors them after the treatment session  after which time the patient is released to an accompanying person and returns the following day s for completion of their treatment 
following the medically supervised treatments  patients receive one month of oral pharmacotherapy and incentives to participate in psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy of their choice 
based on our limited initial experience with a small number of patients in the us  patients who have been through prior treatment programs report that cravings for alcohol or stimulants are significantly reduced or eliminated with the hands protocols  and that they emerge from treatment with greater mental clarity 
initiation of the hands protocols offers the convenience of a to day treatment 
the short period of inpatient or outpatient stay during treatments provides patients convenience and the ability to manage their time away from work and family 
we believe the short treatment period is a major advantage over traditional treatments which typically consist of to days of combined inpatient treatment and washout period  plus up to days in a rehabilitation or residential treatment center 
the traditional treatment requires extended time off work and away from family and friends 
this is particularly relevant since approximately of all current adult illicit drug users are employed  and loss of time from work can be a major deterrent for seeking treatment 
we believe that the hands protocols can be used at any stage of recovery  and can complement existing treatments 
the protocols may be appropriate for alcohol or stimulant dependent patients if they are seeking a targeted  medical approach for combating their disease  disappointed with or have failed other treatment options  are unable to commit to lengthy traditional rehabilitation programs 
additionally  we provide proprietary administrative services to assist physicians and facilities with staff education  marketing and sales support  and outcomes tracking for data analysis 

table of contents competition conventional forms of treatment for alcohol or stimulant dependence are divided into phases detoxification or withdrawal  which is typically conducted in medically supervised environments  and relapse prevention  which is often conducted through short or long term therapeutic facilities or programs  most of which do not offer medical management options 
typically such medically managed programs require long term usage of pharmaceuticals  resulting in low patient compliance 
regardless of the approach  there is great variability in the durations of the treatment procedures  the levels of medical supervision  the costs to the patients and the relapse rates 
currently accepted practice for withdrawing patients from a dependence on alcohol consists of heavily sedating the patient at an inpatient hospital facility for a period of to days 
due to the heavy sedation  the patient typically is stabilized for an additional to days 
this procedure  while medically necessary due to the dangers of convulsions when withdrawing alcoholics from alcohol  does not relieve the patient s cravings or desire to drink 
further  the drugs typically used during this procedure the most commonly utilized medications are valium diazepam  ativan lorazepam  and xanax alprazolam can be addictive  require a time intensive dose tapering and washout period and may cause side effects 
treatment programs there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration samsha that provide substance dependence medical treatment services on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
there appears to be no reliable information about the success rates of these programs  nor agreed upon standards of how outcomes should be measured eg  self reported abstinence or reduction in days of heavy drinking 
samhsa reports that only of those treated for alcoholism and of those treated for cocaine and other stimulants complete the detoxification procedure 
samhsa reports in its drug and alcohol services information system that treatment completion rates in for outpatient treatment were only for alcohol and for cocaine 
these low treatment completion rates are highly associated with relapse rates 
many of these traditional treatment programs have established name recognition and their treatments may be covered in large part by insurance or other third party payors 
our protocols are not currently covered by insurance 
to date  patients treated with the hands protocols have been substantially private pay patients  currently our primary market for the hands protocol 
treatment medications the addiction medication naltrexone  an opiate receptor antagonist  is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia by bristol myers squib  for treatment of alcohol dependence 
however  naltrexone must be administered on a chronic or continuing basis and is associated with relatively high rates of side effects  including nausea 
us sales are estimated to be just under million per year for this treatment 
the french pharmaceutical firm sanofi aventis sa has announced plans to seek fda approval for the experimental drug rimonabant  trade name acomplia  next year 
it claims the drug may be used to treat addiction  including fighting relapse in alcohol and cocaine abuse 
no human test results for rimonabant in alcohol abuse have yet been published 
there are also a number of companies reported to be developing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism 
these include alkermes is developing a long acting injectable form of naltrexone  vivitrex  intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections 
the company reports results from a phase iii clinical study indicated that in the overall study population  patients treated with vivitrex mg experienced approximately a reduction in the rate of heavy drinking relative to placebo 
alkermes reports it intends to submit a new drug application nda to the fda in the first half of 
table of contents merck ag has received fda approval to market campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium 
acamprosate is an nmda receptor antagonist 
the product must be taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis 
forest pharmaceuticals is marketing this product within the us while withdrawal from cocaine dependence is not considered to involve a significant risk of death  withdrawal symptoms from current detoxification procedures are unpleasant 
following an extended period of dependence  cocaine addicts generally are unable to experience the feeling of pleasure during and following detoxification as a result of the effects of cocaine on the brain 
detoxification procedures typically involve the use of sedatives to assist patients through this difficult period 
following treatment  cue induced cravings  however  are especially pronounced and may re occur for months to years 
several classes of pharmaceutical agents have been investigated as potential maintenance agents eg  anti depressants and dopamine agonists  however  none are fda approved for treatment of cocaine dependence or generally accepted in medical practice 
their effects are variable in terms of providing symptomatic relief  and many of the agents may cause side effects or may not be well tolerated by patients 
there are currently no accepted medical treatments for methamphetamine dependence 
anti depressants and dopamine agonists have been investigated as possible maintenance therapies  but none have been fda approved or are generally accepted for medical practice 
in october yaupon therapeutics announced it has initiated human clinical testing of its plant derived experimental treatment for methamphetamine addiction  lobeline  in a phase i safety trial 
as noted above  we believe the hands protocols can be used at any stage of recovery  and can complement existing treatments 
as such  our protocols offer a potentially valuable alternative to traditional medical treatment 
moreover  because treatment with the hands protocols is designed to target neurochemical imbalances in the brain over a short course of treatment  we do not view the current medical therapies as directly competitive 
our competitive advantage we believe the hands protocols can offer an advantage to traditional alternatives for several reasons 
first  treatment provided under the hands protocols is designed to addresses a spectrum of patient needs  including physiological  nutritional and psychological elements 
second  the hands protocols are targeted  medically supervised procedures designed to address the neurochemical imbalances in the brain caused or worsened by substance dependence 
the rationale for the approach is that by addressing the underlying physiologic aspects of substance dependence  dependent persons may be afforded an opportunity to better address the behavioral and environmental components of their disease 
third  initiation of the hands protocols offers the convenience of a to day treatment 
fourth  the hands protocols are designed to minimize withdrawal symptoms  reduce cravings  and provide patients with support as they progress through the recovery process 
fifth  the protocols are designed for use at any stage of recovery  and can complement existing treatments 

table of contents retrospective data collected from patients treated with the hands protocols at our first us licensee treatment center suggest promising results in terms of treatment completion rates  abstinence rates and reduction of cravings based on patient follow up ranging from three to twelve months post treatment 
at little company of mary san pedro hospital  patients were treated from november through december with the hands protocols  of whom approximately had unsuccessfully undergone prior treatment 
for alcohol patients and stimulant patients  who were followed for days and days post treatment  the outcome results are summarized below alcohol days post treatment continuous abstinence use with no problems relapsed unknown total patients stimulants cocaine and methamphetamine days post treatment continuous abstinence use with no problems relapsed unknown total patients patients reporting use of the substance at least once post treatment  but not returning to harmful or compulsive use 
following treatment patient self reports include elimination of cravings and increased mental clarity and focus cognitive function 
further  patients were asked to rate their quality of life before and after treatment  most of whom reported both immediate and sustained post treatment improvement in sleep  appetite  mood  concentration  memory  work  relationships and stress 
the outcomes shown above are for patients treated with the current hands protocols in one treatment center 
outcome information was obtained by follow up phone interview by the clinical site manager 
the limited initial results of the retrospective evaluation were not obtained in a formal research study  may not provide a sufficient sample size to draw any conclusions regarding efficacy  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance of our protocols 
in addition  patients statuses may change after longer periods of post treatment follow up  negatively affecting the overall results of the treatment outcomes collected to date 
we are currently in the process of awarding unrestricted grants for research studies in special populations and controlled studies to test the efficacy of the hands protocols 
formal research  further studies  independent research reports or reviews may qualify or contradict the limited results that we have observed 
we believe that the total cost of providing treatment using the hands protocols falls within the typical range of prices for conventional treatment programs 
we also believe  based on the limited initial results discussed above  that treatment using our protocols may have higher completion rates  greater compliance  reduction or elimination of withdrawal symptoms  reduction or elimination of cravings  improved cognitive functioning and potentially lower relapse rates 
our strategy we intend to continue our efforts to exploit our current proprietary  patent pending treatment technology by expanding the number of treatment sites that license our protocols  increase awareness about the hands approach among consumers and  ultimately  professional audiences  through both local and national marketing initiatives designed to increase patient throughput to sites with license rights to the protocols  and acquire  license  develop and bring to market new substance dependence treatment protocols via our own internal research and development as well as strategic alliances with major research institutions worldwide 

table of contents expand the number of inpatient treatment sites we currently have multi year contracts with fourteen hospitals and healthcare providers to license and utilize the hands protocols  of which twelve were signed in the last six months and are in various stages of training and start up 
for the year ended december   hands licensing fees from one hospital in los angeles accounted for of our revenues 
we intend to continue to develop a system of licensees within the us authorized to use the hands protocols for those diagnosed with dependence to alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine  as well as combinations of these drugs 
we are actively engaged in seeking to expand our base of treatment sites  focusing on large metropolitan areas within the us we will focus our expansion plans on densely populated cities  particularly in states where patients are migrating to other states for treatment at residential facilities 
we believe our treatment protocols will provide hospitals and physicians access to an affordable and convenient treatment alternative for their substance dependent patients 
local and national marketing initiatives to consumers and professionals the hands protocols represent a medically supervised approach to treatment rooted in the belief that by addressing the underlying physiologic aspects of substance dependence  dependent persons may be afforded an opportunity to better address the behavioral and environmental components of their disease 
we intend to utilize both local and national marketing initiatives to raise awareness of the hands approach in order to increase patient awareness of the hands protocols 
the marketing strategy will initially focus on consumers  by providing education and information that emphasizes substance dependence as a disease  highlights the potential benefits of hands as an innovative and convenient medically supervised treatment approach  and encourages consumers to consult treatment for more information 
as data from our research studies become available  we will expand our marketing initiatives to more aggressively target the professional community eg  physicians  counselors  therapists  payors and other allied professionals 
this staged strategic approach to our marketing efforts takes into account i the need to increase patient awareness of licensee sites  and ii that a more robust data dossier will be required by the professional community 
develop new substance dependence treatment protocols our goal is to bring new treatment protocols to market on an ongoing basis 
we will seek to acquire or license new substance dependence treatment protocols that may be developed in the future 
further  we intend our internal research programs will utilize an array of alliances and partnerships with other organizations specializing in the research and development of new substance dependence treatment technologies 
we believe that this research alliance strategy will seek to create  maintain and strengthen our position as a leader in dependence treatment technology 
our technology  products and services our treatment technology is based on studies and research that have established that substance dependence is associated with altered cortical activity and changes in neurotransmitter function  which are critical to brain function 
moreover  the changes in the neurochemistry of the brain underlie the hallmarks of substance dependence  including craving  tolerance  withdrawal symptoms and relapse 
our protocols are designed to address the neurochemical imbalances in the brain induced or exacerbated by substance dependence  as well as provide nutritional supplementation and incentives for individualized continuing care 
we have labeled this proprietary approach the hands protocols 
there are two products available for licensing by hospitals and other healthcare providers the hands protocol for alcohol dependence and the hands protocol for stimulant dependence or combined dependence to alcohol and stimulants 
additionally  we provide proprietary administrative services to assist physicians and facilities with staff education  marketing and sales support  and outcomes tracking for data analysis 

table of contents the hands protocols consist of a comprehensive physical exam  including specific laboratory tests  prior to initiation of treatment medical supervised administration of prescription medications and nutritional supplements discharge prescription medications and nutritional supplements information about and incentives for individualized continuing care options the hands protocols involve the off label administration of both oral and intravenously administered medications that have been fda approved for indications other than substance dependence 
while the risks and benefits of the combinations of the medications used in the hands protocols have not been established  physicians are permitted to prescribe prescription drugs for off label uses in the independent practice of medicine 
the hands protocols are not appropriate for all patients 
it is up to the hands treating physician to decide whether treatment with the hands protocols is appropriate for any given patient 
the hands treating physician must make the treatment decision regarding appropriateness of using the hands protocol during the detoxification  or any other stage  of substance dependence recovery 
some of the medical tests may be performed by the potential patient s primary care physician and be reviewed in collaboration with the hands treating physician 
it is up to the hands treating physician to decide where and by whom any required medical tests will be performed 
we do not endorse or recommend any particular physicians and identify for information purposes only those physicians who have obtained license rights to use the hands protocols 
we make no representations about the quality of care rendered by these or any other physicians 
we do not provide medical advice or medical treatment and make no claims about the effectiveness and suitability of the hands protocols for any individual patient 
sales and marketing substance dependence is a worldwide problem with prevalence rates continuing to rise despite the efforts by national and local health authorities to curtail its growth 
we will focus on expanding our presence in the us market by targeting geographic areas with high numbers of substance dependent individuals  and licensing our protocols and providing our services to healthcare providers in those areas 
we will focus our direct sales efforts on recruiting new healthcare providers in identified target markets to expand our number of treatment site customers 
our marketing strategy is based upon developing and promoting a comprehensive treatment approach integrating proprietary state of the art treatment protocols  assessment tools  education  and information about aftercare programs 
we will co promote programs with our licensees through community outreach initiatives  local sponsorship of professional education programs  public relations  targeted advertising and direct mail 
on a national level  we will promote our proprietary brands through internet marketing  advocacy development  targeted advertising  and sponsorship of educational programs 
our marketing of the hands protocols will be done in two ways promoting broad awareness focused target market initiatives broad awareness will be done via our consumer website  press releases  endorsements  printed media advertising  internet promotions and local radio  television and print media coverage 
we will support local targeted marketing efforts of the hospitals  healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers that license our hands protocols 
additional target market campaigns may be accomplished via local publications  direct mail  seminars  forums  tradeshows  community outreach and email to generate referral sources and referrals 

table of contents community outreach as noted above  a cornerstone to our marketing strategy will be to increase awareness among consumer audiences by providing education and information about substance dependence as a disease  and the hands protocols as an innovative  convenient medically supervised treatment approach 
working in concert with our licensees  we intend to create or leverage community forums eg  community presentations  health fairs  etc 
that will provide opportunities to engage our target segments  most notably consumers ie  potential patients  their families and friends  leaders from the local business communities and  to a lesser extent until data is available from the hands research studies  referral sources within the healthcare community 
we also intend to utilize direct mail or other outreach vehicles to offer branded educational and informational materials to promote a direct and iterative dialogue with consumers and  pending data availability  professional constituents 
our community outreach activities may also involve partnering with third party organizations on either a local or national level to further increase the penetration of these initiatives within targeted market segments  as well as provide a potential public relations platform to enhance the reach of the initiatives 
public relations the goal of our public relations program will be primarily to promote awareness and generate leads from consumers ie  potential patients  their families and friends  with a secondary emphasis on referral sources  healthcare professionals and third party organizations 
this may be done via press releases  endorsements  and media placement campaigns 
the forms of media that will be targeted for placement will be print media  local radio segments and stories  internet postings  local  regional  and national television segments and stories 
we believe this form of awareness lead generation to be superior to advertising both in terms of quality of awareness and number of leads generated 
advertising we anticipate that advertising will be limited to local publications in regional treatment center areas  specific trade publications for occupations with high substance dependence rates  healthcare professional publications with subscribers who would be good referral sources and top internet search engines 
in addition to our goal of the hands protocols becoming a preferred treatment method for individuals seeking to pay for treatment privately  we believe that third party payors  including entities from both the government and private sectors  will be important to our long term growth 
we will conduct business development initiatives to secure the acceptance and endorsement of treatment using our protocols as appropriate for reimbursement by third party payors  nationally recognized substance dependence treatment organizations and governmental organizations 
target payor groups in developing our marketing plan  we have taken into consideration the following market dynamics for our efforts traditional payors private pay to date  patients treated with the hands protocol have been substantially private pay patients 
our protocols are not currently approved for payment by any health insurance companies or other third party payors 
according to reports by samhsa  of persons aged twelve or older who received any alcohol or illicit drug treatment  more paid for all or part of their most recent treatment with their own savings or earnings or those of family or friends than any other source 
we will continue to focus our efforts on targeted communication to private pay patients and their families emphasizing the convenience and potential benefits of treatment using the hands protocols 
moreover  as we are aware of no generally accepted medical treatments for methamphetamine dependence  we will have the opportunity to communicate the potential benefits of the hands protocol for stimulant dependence to persons affected by methamphetamine dependence 

table of contents managed care  insurance and other third party reimbursement in order to compete effectively for managed care agreements and receive adequate reimbursement from payors for treatment using our protocols  clinical evidence must demonstrate that use of the hands protocols is a beneficial and cost effective treatment approach 
we will  through our clinical and market research activities  gather and disseminate appropriate data to the payor community that should validate the benefits and cost effectiveness of treatment using the hands protocols 
we believe that studies involving the hands protocols have the potential to demonstrate cost effectiveness across patient populations 
we plan to include or contract directly with disease state management providers in the design and conduct of our outcome studies 
other payor groups drug courts and prison systems according to a bureau of justice statistics bulletin  prisoners in  published in august  approximately of the million state and of the  federal prisoners were convicted of drug offenses 
a significant number of state and federal prisoners receive alcohol treatment after admission into prison 
we believe that state and federal prison systems are in need of a more beneficial and convenient treatment alternative and we intend to solicit major prison systems to utilize our protocols 
more importantly  we will seek to work with state and federal justice systems to intervene prior to incarceration with a goal of reducing the number of drug offenders admitted into prison 
drug courts first came to prominence in as a means to deal with the growing number of alleged offenders involved with substance abuse 
according to the drug court activity fact sheet  may   the number of drug courts grew to in and as of may   there are  drug courts located in all states  with over  participants to date 
drug courts generally encourage the user to seek treatment in lieu of incarceration 
we will seek to engage and educate all parties judges  attorneys  physicians  counselors that influence the selection of the drug treatment facility 
employee assistance programs approximately of the american workforce is unionized 
many of these unions and large employers support employee assistance programs eaps that are well positioned to assist employees with a variety of social  legal  financial  and medical issues including substance dependence 
for many blue collar workers with addictive disabilities  eaps are the first line of defense and support 
for us  these eaps may provide a potential referral source for centers that license our technology for qualified clients with third party financial support 
according to infousa  there are approximately  eaps in the united states 
we plan to begin addressing this market by targeting discussions with large benefit companies that administer eaps 
research and development we have contracted with a contract research organization cro to establish a clinical outcomes registry for the monitoring and evaluation of up to patients undergoing the hands protocols at our commercial licensee sites 
we are also in the process of awarding unrestricted grants for a number of research studies commencing in to generate clinical data on the hands protocols 
the research studies will include open label studies for alcohol and methamphetamine dependence as well as controlled  double blind studies conducted by preeminent researchers in the field of substance dependence 
the combined cost of these studies and patient outcomes registry is estimated at approximately million over the next two years 
we expect the outcomes data from these studies may serve as validation for third party payors 
we intend to continually enhance our substance dependence treatment technology and products as well as research and develop new products to maintain technological competitiveness and deliver increasing value to new and existing customers 
we are in the process of seeking to establish research collaborations with researchers specializing in the science of substance dependence 
we will continue to expand our target markets by acquiring or licensing treatment methods for other substance dependencies as new technology is developed and becomes available 

table of contents proprietary rights and licensing our success depends upon a number of factors  including our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to help ensure compliance with our license joint venture agreements  we intend to deploy onsite business area managers 
in march we acquired the patent pending treatment protocols for alcohol and stimulants  which we have branded the hands protocols 
we have the following branded trade names hythiam hands hands protocols hands protocol the hands patient protocol hands treatment protocol we impose restrictions in our protocol license agreements on our customers rights to utilize and disclose our technology 
we also seek to protect our intellectual property by generally requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and by restricting access to our proprietary information 
we require that  as a condition of their employment  employees assign to us their interests in inventions  original works of authorship  copyrights and similar intellectual property rights conceived or developed by them during their employment with us 
financial information about segments we currently have only one business segment  domestic licensing of the hands protocols  which generated of our revenues for the year ended december  employees as of december   we employed persons 
we anticipate hiring additional employees over the next year to meet our growth expectations

we consider terren s 
peizer  anthony m 
lamacchia  chuck timpe  monica alfaro welling  james w 
elder and david e 
smith  md to be our executive officers 
codes of ethics we have adopted a code of conduct and ethics that applies to all company directors  officers and employees 
we have also adopted a code of ethics for ceo and senior financial officers that applies to our chief executive officer and senior financial officers  including our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer 
risk factors you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this report  including the risk factors listed below 
risks and uncertainties in addition to those we describe below  that may not be presently known to us  or that we currently believe are immaterial  may also harm our business and operations 
if any of these risks occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements contained in this report 

table of contents risks related to our business we are a development stage company with a limited operating history  making it difficult to evaluate our future performance we are a development stage company with a very limited history of operations 
we were formed in february and commenced operations in june investors have no substantive financial information on prior operations to evaluate the company as an investment 
our potential future success must be viewed in light of the problems  expenses  difficulties  delays and complications often encountered in the formation of a new business 
we will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of a startup development stage company such as regulatory setbacks and delays  fluctuations in expenses  competition  the general strength of regional and national economies  and governmental regulation 
any failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties would seriously harm our business and prospects 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses  and if we are not able to raise necessary additional funds we may have to reduce or stop operations we have not generated significant revenues or become profitable  may never do so  and may not generate sufficient working capital to cover the cost of operations 
we had revenues of  in and  in  primarily generated from a single hospital 
our accumulated deficit through december  was million 
we anticipate that operating deficits will continue to arise during the next months of our operations 
because many of our costs generally will not decrease  the cost of operating the company will exceed the income therefrom during this period 
no party has guaranteed to advance additional funds to us to provide for any such operating deficits 
our cash and marketable securities reserves were approximately million as of december  our current cash burn rate is approximately million per month 
we expect to increase our monthly expenditures over the next twelve months as we increase staff  commence marketing activities  expand the number of licensees and initiate research studies 
if our revenues do not meet expectations and our expenses continue to increase  our cash reserves will be exhausted in approximately fifteen months  and we will be required to seek additional funds 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings or collaborative arrangements 
if we obtain additional capital through collaborative arrangements  these arrangements may require us to relinquish greater rights to our technologies and protocols than we might otherwise have done 
if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity  or securities convertible into equity  further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
if we raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt  our business may be affected by the amount of leverage we incur  and our borrowings may subject us to restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we may be required to delay  reduce or stop operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on third party healthcare providers licensing and using our products and services  and if they delay or fail to do so our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected only a physician may treat patients using the hands protocols  which requires us to enter into licenses with hospitals  properly equipped outpatient settings or other treatment facilities in order to provide convenient treatment access points for patients 
our sales are therefore dependent to a significant degree upon the relationships we can establish with hospitals  physicians and other healthcare facilities to license our protocols for treating their patients 
through december   substantially all of our revenues have been derived from licensing fees from only one hospital 
as of march   fourteen hospitals and healthcare providers have entered into agreements with us  twelve of whom have signed contracts with us since september  the number of patients treated in by our licensees was  including in the fourth quarter 
rollout is anticipated to be dependent on our ability to negotiate and conclude licensing agreements within major metropolitan areas across the country and their ability to generate patients 
if we are unable to enter into similar arrangements with additional healthcare providers for any reason  that would significantly limit our growth potential and negatively impact our business prospects 
in addition  if hospitals and healthcare providers do not attract sufficient patient volume and revenue they may not be willing to carry or continue to offer our products and services 

table of contents the success of our protocols is ultimately dependent upon referrals of patients to facilities that license our technology and upon the use of our protocols by physicians in treating their patients 
there is no requirement for physicians to refer their patients to facilities that license our protocols  or to use our protocols in treating their patients 
they are free to refer patients to any other substance dependence treatment service  program or facility  and to treat their patients using whatever method they determine to be in the patients best interests 
the failure of our products and services to generate physician referrals to facilities that use our products and services  or the loss of key referring physicians or physicians that use our protocols could have a material adverse effect on operations and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
we may be dependent on third party collaborations to develop our products and services and  if they fail or refuse to perform  commercialization of our protocols may be delayed our future success will depend in part on establishing and maintaining effective strategic partnerships and collaborations to gain access to treatment modalities  expand and complement our research  development and commercialization capabilities  and reduce the cost of developing and commercializing protocols on our own 
while we are in discussions with a number of companies and institutions to establish relationships and collaborations  we may not reach definitive agreements with any of them 
even if we enter into these arrangements  we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms 
furthermore  these arrangements may require us to grant rights to third parties or may have other terms that are burdensome to us  and may involve the acquisition of our securities 
our partners may decide to develop alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
if any of our partners terminate their relationship with us or fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner  the development or commercialization of our potential technology and protocols may be substantially delayed 
we may fail to successfully manage and maintain the growth of our business  which could adversely affect our results of operations as we implement commercial operations and continue expanding our sales and marketing activities  this expansion could put significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
to manage future growth  we will need to continue to hire  train and manage additional employees  particularly a specially trained sales force to market our protocols 
concurrent with expanding our operational and marketing activities  we will also be increasing our research and development activities  most significantly the development of protocols for other types of addictions  with the expectation of ultimately commercializing those products 
we have maintained a small financial and accounting staff  and our reporting obligations as a public company  as well as our need to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  the rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq national market  will place significant demands on our financial and accounting staff  on our financial  accounting and information systems and on our internal controls 
as we grow  we will need to add additional accounting staff and continue to improve our financial  accounting and information systems and internal controls in order to fulfill our reporting responsibilities and to support growth in our business 
we cannot assure you that our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our anticipated growth or that management will be able to hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
our failure to manage growth effectively could limit our ability to achieve our marketing and commercialization goals or to satisfy our reporting and other obligations as a public company 
our treatment protocols may not be as effective as we believe them to be  which could limit or prevent us from establishing and maintaining product revenues our belief in the efficacy of our treatment protocols is based on a limited number of unpublished studies  primarily in spain  and our very limited initial experience with a small number of patients in the united states 
such results may not be statistically significant  have not been subjected to detailed scientific scrutiny  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance of our protocols 
while we have not experienced such problems  if our treatment protocols cannot be effectively implemented on a large scale basis or the initially indicated results cannot be successfully replicated  we may be unable to implement our business model 

table of contents our marketing efforts may not result in acceptance of our protocols in the marketplace  which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings while we have been able to generate initial interest in our protocols among a limited number of healthcare providers  there can be no assurance that our efforts or the efforts of others will be successful in fostering acceptance of our protocols in the target markets 
if our marketing and promotional efforts are not as successful as we expect them to be  the likelihood of expending all of our funds prior to reaching a level of profitability will be increased 
marketplace acceptance of our protocols may largely depend upon healthcare providers interpretation of our limited data  or upon reviews and reports that may be given by independent researchers 
we are in the process of awarding unrestricted grants to academic and affiliated research institutions and other research organizations interested in conducting research studies of our hands protocols 
in the event the testing by such groups does not give our treatment technology high approval ratings  it is unlikely we will be able to achieve significant market acceptance 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully the healthcare business in general  and the substance dependence treatment business in particular  are highly competitive 
hospitals and healthcare providers that treat substance dependence are highly competitive  and we must convince them that they will benefit by use of our protocols 
we will compete with many types of substance dependence treatment facilities and other service providers  many of whom are more established and better funded than we are 
many of these other products and services are well established in the same markets we will target  have substantial sales volume  and are provided and marketed by companies with much greater financial resources  facilities  organization and experience than we have 
the addiction medication naltrexone is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia by bristol myers squibb for the treatment of alcohol dependence 
however  naltrexone must be administered on a chronic or continuing basis and is associated with relatively high rates of side effects  including nausea 
us sales are estimated to be just under million per year for this treatment 
the french pharmaceutical firm sanofi aventis sa has announced plans to seek fda approval for the experimental drug rimonabant  trade name acomplia  next year 
it claims the drug may be used to treat addiction  including fighting relapse in alcohol and cocaine abuse 
no human test results for rimonabant in alcohol abuse have yet been published 
there are also a number of companies reported to be developing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism 
these include alkermes is developing a long acting injectable form of naltrexone  vivitrex  intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections 
the company reports results from a phase iii clinical study indicated that in the overall study population  patients treated with vivitrex mg experienced approximately a reduction in the rate of heavy drinking relative to placebo 
alkermes intends to submit a new drug application nda to the fda in the first half of merck ag has received fda approval to market campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium 
acomprasate is an nmda receptor antagonist 
the product must be taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis 
forest pharmaceuticals is marketing this product within the us we see these products as being potentially useful during the continuing care phase of treatment following treatment using the hands protocols  but not being directly competitive 
to the best of our knowledge  there are no treatment protocols or medications approved  marketed or in development within the us that reduce the cravings for cocaine  methamphetamine or other additive prescription psychostimulants 
however  our competitors may develop and introduce new processes and products that are equal or superior to our protocols in treating substance dependences 
accordingly  we may be adversely affected by any new processes and technology developed by our competitors 

table of contents there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration that provide substance dependence medical treatment services on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
we believe the hands protocols offer an advantage to traditional alternatives because they provide a medically supervised treatment methodology that is non sedating  the initial treatment can be completed in only two to three days  and they are designed to offer an immediate improvement in cognitive function and to reduce craving  a primary cause of relapse 
for cocaine and other addictive stimulants there is a two day follow up treatment three weeks later 
however  we anticipate several potential points of resistance to penetrating the substance dependence treatment market 
first  there is the historical focus on the use of psychological or behavioral therapies as opposed to medical or physiological treatments for substance dependence 
healthcare providers and potential patients may be resistant to the transition of treating substance dependence as a disease rather than as a behavioral aberration 
second  healthcare providers may be reluctant to use the hands protocols due to the absence of published clinical studies supporting their efficacy 
while we have embarked upon an active clinical program which is intended to lead to publications in medical journals  there can be no assurance that the clinical program will lead to acceptable results or that the results will be published 
if we are unable to penetrate these substantial barriers to entry we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which could impact the ability to manage our business our future success depends on the performance of our senior management and key professional personnel 
it therefore depends to a significant extent on retaining the services of our key executive officers  in particular our chairman and chief executive officer  terren s 
peizer  our director and chief operating officer  anthony m 
lamacchia  our chief financial officer  chuck timpe  our senior vice president of marketing  monica alfaro welling  and our senior vice president of medical affairs  david e 
smith  md each of these key executives is party to an employment agreement which  subject to termination for cause or good reason  has a term of four or five years 
while we believe our relationships with our executives are good and do not anticipate any of them leaving in the near future  the loss of the services of mr 
peizer or any other key member of management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business 
while we have not experienced any problems in attracting and retaining desirable employees  our success is dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified management  professional  administrative and sales personnel to support our future growth 
we are subject to personal injury claims  which could result in substantial liabilities that may exceed our insurance coverage all significant medical treatments and procedures  including treatment utilizing our protocols  involve the risk of serious injury or death 
while we do not treat patients and have not been the subject of any personal injury claims for patients treated by providers using our protocols  our business entails an inherent risk of claims for personal injuries  which are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards 
a significant source of potential liability is negligence or alleged negligence by physicians treating patients using our protocols 
in addition  our contracts may require us to indemnify physicians  hospitals or their affiliates for losses resulting from claims of negligence 
there can be no assurance that a future claim or claims will not be successful or  including the cost of legal defense  will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage 
we currently have insurance coverage for up to million per year for personal injury claims 
we may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance  in accordance with standard industry practice  with appropriate coverage based on the nature and risks of our business  at acceptable costs and on favorable terms 
insurance carriers are often reluctant to provide liability insurance for new healthcare services companies and products due to the limited claims history for such companies and products 
in addition  based on current insurance markets  we expect that liability insurance will be more difficult to obtain and that premiums will increase over time 
in the event of litigation  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  or an award against us during a time when we have no available insurance or insufficient insurance  we may sustain significant losses of our operating capital which may substantially impair or destroy the investments of stockholders 

table of contents risks related to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect the proprietary treatment protocols which are the core of our business we consider the protection of our proprietary treatment protocols to be critical to our business prospects 
we obtained the rights to some of our most significant patent pending technologies through a license agreement which is subject to a number of conditions and restrictions  and a breach or termination of that agreement could significantly impact our ability to use and develop our technologies 
in addition  the patent applications filed and licensed by us may not issue as patents  and any issued patents may be too narrow in scope to provide us with a competitive advantage 
our patent position is uncertain and includes complex factual and legal issues  including the existence of prior art in the literature that may preclude a claim of novelty 
other inventors may have filed earlier patent applications of which we are unaware and which may prevent our applications from being granted 
patent examiners and third parties may object to the validity or scope of some or all of our claims 
any of the patents that have been or may be issued to us will expire twenty years after they are filed 
competitors or others may at any time institute challenges against the validity or enforceability of any patent owned by us  and if successful our patents may be denied  rendered unenforceable  or invalidated 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents  and to protect and prevent infringement of patents can be substantial 
maintaining  prosecuting  and enforcing a patent portfolio might require funds that may not be available 
we may not be able to adequately protect the aspects of our treatment protocols that are not subject to patent protection  or are subject to only limited patent protection 
furthermore  competitors and others may independently develop similar or more advanced treatment protocols and technologies  may design around aspects of our technology  or may discover or duplicate our trade secrets and proprietary methods 
to the extent we utilize processes and technology that constitute trade secrets under state laws  we must implement appropriate levels of security for those trade secrets to secure the protection of such laws  which we may not do effectively 
for some of our proprietary rights  we may need to secure assignments of rights from independent contractors and third parties to perfect our rights  and if we fail to do so they may retain ownership rights in the intellectual property upon which our business is based 
policing compliance with our confidentiality agreements and unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and we may be unable to determine whether piracy of our technology has occurred 
in addition  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the united states 
while we have not had any significant issues to date  the loss of any of the proprietary rights which we believe are protected under the foregoing intellectual property safeguards may result in the loss of our competitive advantage over present and potential competitors 
confidentiality agreements with employees  licensees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we rely in part on confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees  licensees  treating physicians and others 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information 
to date we have had one instance  in february  in which it was necessary to send a formal demand to cease and desist using our protocols to treat patients to a consultant who had signed a confidentiality agreement 
he subsequently complied with the demand and signed an innovation  proprietary information and confidentiality agreement  and an intellectual property assignment agreement 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 

table of contents we may not be able to adequately protect our other intellectual property rights  which could limit our ability to compete while we believe we have proprietary ownership  assigned or licensed rights in intellectual property which is capable of protection under federal copyright and patent laws  and under state laws regarding trade secrets  we may not have taken appropriate legal measures  and may not be able to adequately secure the necessary protections for our intellectual property 
we have not patented all of our technologies  or registered all of our trademarks or copyrights and  until we do so  we must rely on various state and common law rights for enforcement of the rights to exclusive use of our trade secrets  trademark and copyrights 
our trademark applications for our trademarks hands  the hands patient protocol  hands treatment protocol  hands protocol  hands protocols  hythiam and the hythiam logo are pending before the us patent and trademark office  and we have not yet been granted registration for these marks 
if our trademark registrations are objected to or denied that may impact our ability to use and protect our brand names and company and product identity 
although we have applied for trademarks for some of our brand names  and patents on some of our products  in the future we may decide not to secure federal registration of certain copyrights  trademarks or patents to which we may be entitled 
failure to do so  in the case of copyrights and trademarks  may reduce our access to the courts  and to certain remedies of statutory damages and attorneys fees  to which we may be entitled in the event of a violation of our proprietary and intellectual rights by third parties 
similarly  the failure to seek registration of any patents to which we may be entitled may result in loss of patent protection should a third party copy the patentable equipment  technology or process 
the loss of any proprietary rights which are protectable under any of the foregoing intellectual property safeguards may result in the loss of a competitive advantage over present or potential competitors  with a resulting decrease in the profitability for us 
there is no guarantee that such a loss of competitive advantage could be remedied or overcome by us at a price which we would be willing or able to pay 
we may be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and unfavorable outcomes could harm our business our future operations may be subject to claims  and potential litigation  arising from our alleged infringement of patents  trade secrets or copyrights owned by other third parties 
we intend to fully comply with the law in avoiding such alleged infringements 
however  within the healthcare  drug and bio technology industry  established companies have actively pursued such infringements  and have initiated such claims and litigation  which has made the entry of competitive products more difficult 
there can be no guarantee that we will not experience such claims or litigation initiated by existing  better funded competitors 
court ordered injunctions may prevent us from bringing new products to market  and the resulting loss of revenues and expenses of litigation may substantially affect our ability to meet our expenses and continue operations 
risks related to our industry the healthcare industry in which we operate is subject to substantial regulation by state and federal authorities  which could hinder  delay or prevent us from commercializing our protocols we generate revenues by charging fees directly to the healthcare providers who license our technology and contract for our services 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes as third party payors  such as medicare and medicaid  traditional indemnity insurers  managed care organizations and other private payors increase efforts to control cost  utilization and delivery of healthcare services 
although our licensees do not currently bill or seek reimbursement from medicare  medicaid or other governmental organizations for the treatment of patients using the hands protocols  we are nevertheless subject to the overall effect of the changes created by increased cost control and financial pressures on the industry 
we believe that this industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation  political and legal action  the scope and effect of which we cannot predict 
legislation is continuously being proposed  enacted and interpreted at the federal  state and local levels to regulate healthcare delivery and relationships between and among participants in the healthcare industry 
many healthcare laws are complex  applied broadly and subject to interpretation by courts and government agencies 
many existing healthcare laws and regulations were enacted without anticipation of our business structure or our products and services  yet these laws and regulations may be applied to us and our products and services 
our failure  or the failure of our customers and business partners  accurately to anticipate the application of these healthcare laws and regulations could create liability for us and negatively impact our business 

table of contents healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal  state and local laws  regulations and judicial decisions governing various matters such as the licensing and certification of facilities and personnel  the conduct of operations  billing policies and practices  policies and practices with regard to patient privacy and confidentiality  and prohibitions on payments for the referral of business and self referrals 
there are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals  physician financial relationships  submission of healthcare claims and inducement to beneficiaries of federal healthcare programs 
many states prohibit business corporations from practicing medicine  employing or maintaining control over physicians who practice medicine  or engaging in certain business practices  such as splitting fees with healthcare providers 
some or all of these state and federal regulations may apply to us or the services we intend to provide or may provide in the future 
in addition  the food and drug administration  or fda  regulates development  testing  labeling  manufacturing  marketing  distribution  record keeping and reporting requirements for prescription drugs  medical devices and biologics 
compliance with laws and regulations enforced by these agencies may be required relative to any medical products or services developed or used by us 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may require modification and redesign of our products  or elimination of the product 
we may not have the financial resources to modify our products or implement new designs 
accordingly  our ability to market our protocols in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be a threshold test for our survival 
there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our proposed products and services or the interpretation thereof will not change and any such changes could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products and services for a period of time or permanently 
we are unable to predict the extent of adverse governmental regulation which might arise from future federal  state or foreign legislative  judicial or administrative action 
the federal government from time to time has made proposals to change aspects of the delivery and financing of healthcare services 
we cannot predict what form any such legislation may take  how the courts would interpret it  or what effect such legislation would have on our business 
it is possible that any such legislation ultimately enacted will contain provisions which may adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to regulatory and investigative proceedings  which may find that our policies and procedures do not fully comply with complex and changing healthcare regulations we have established policies and procedures that we believe will be sufficient to ensure that we operate in substantial compliance with applicable laws  regulations and requirements 
patients treated using the hands protocols receive medical care in accordance with orders from their attending physicians 
each licensed physician is responsible for exercising their own independent medical judgment in determining the specific application of our treatment protocols  and the appropriate course of care for each patient 
no employment relationship is expected to exist between us and the attending physicians who treat patients using our protocol 
in the course of performing our administrative duties  we may bill and collect funds from patients on behalf of the healthcare provider  and disburse a portion of that money to the facility and or the attending physician for professional services rendered 
we do not currently operate our own healthcare facilities  employ our own treating physicians or provide medical advice or treatment to patients 
the hospitals and licensed healthcare facilities that contract for the use of our technology own their facility license  and control and are responsible for the clinical activities provided on their premises 
after the treatment procedure  local clinics and healthcare providers specializing in drug abuse treatment administer and provide follow up care 
while we believe that our business practices are consistent with applicable law  the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation 
we may become the subject of regulatory or other investigations or proceedings  and our interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s time and attention 
thus  any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  regardless of whether it ultimately is successful 
if we fail to comply with any applicable laws  or a determination is made that we have failed to comply with these laws  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  changes in health care laws or regulations may restrict our operations  limit the expansion of our business or impose additional compliance requirements 

table of contents the promotion of our products and services may be found to violate federal law concerning off label uses of prescription drugs  which could prevent us from marketing our protocols the food drug cosmetic act  or fdc act  requires that prescription drugs be approved for a specific medical indication by the fda prior to their marketing in interstate commerce 
while we do not manufacture  sell  or distribute prescription drugs  our procedural medical protocols call for the use of prescription drugs for the treatment of chemical dependence and drug addiction  conditions not named in the drugs official labeling 
while the fda allows for pre approval exchange of scientific information  provided it is nonpromotional in nature and does not draw conclusions about the ultimate safety or effectiveness of the unapproved drug  and generally does not regulate licensed physicians who prescribe approved drugs for non approved or off label uses in the independent practice of medicine  our promotion of our products and services may be found to violate fda regulations or the fdc act 
the fda has broad discretion in interpreting those regulations 
if the fda determines that our promotion of our medical treatment protocols constitutes labeling or the promotion of prescription drugs for unapproved uses  or brings an enforcement action against us for violating the fdc act or fda regulations  we may be unable to continue operating under our current business model 
even if we defeat any fda challenge  the expenses associated with defending the claim or negative publicity concerning our off label use of drugs could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
treatment using our protocol may be found to require review or approval  which could delay or prevent the study or use of our protocols the fda asserts jurisdiction over all clinical trials  or experiments  in which a drug is administered to human subjects 
hospitals and clinics have established institutional review boards  or irbs  to review and approve clinical trials using investigational treatments in their facilities 
certain investigations involving new drugs or off label uses for approved drugs are subject to fda approvals 
while the decision about seeking irb review is in the discretion of  and is the responsibility of  each hospital or physician  use of our treatment protocol by individual physicians in treating their patients may be found to constitute a clinical trial or investigation that requires irb review or fda approval 
fda has broad authority in interpreting and applying its regulations  so there can be no assurance that fda will not find that use of our protocols by our licensees or collection of outcomes data on that use constitutes a clinical investigation subject to irb and fda jurisdiction 
individual hospitals and physicians may also submit their use of our protocols in treatment to their irbs and there is no assurance individual irbs will not find that use to be a clinical trial that requires fda approval or that they will not prohibit or place restrictions on that use 
either of these results may adversely affect our business and the ability of our customers to use our protocols 
our business practices may be found to constitute illegal fee splitting or corporate practice of medicine  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business many states  including california in which our principal executive offices are located  have laws that prohibit business corporations  such as hythiam  from practicing medicine  exercising control over medical judgments or decisions of physicians  or engaging in certain arrangements  such as employment or fee splitting  with physicians 
courts  regulatory authorities or other parties  including physicians  may assert that we are engaged in the unlawful corporate practice of medicine by providing administrative and ancillary services in connection with our protocols  or that our contractual arrangements to license our technology for a portion of the patient fees constitute improper fee splitting  in which case we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable  in whole or in part  or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements 
there can be no assurance that this will not occur or  if it does  that we would be able to restructure our contractual arrangements on favorable terms 
our business practices may be found to violate anti kickback  self referral or false claims laws  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to financial relationships and kickbacks involving healthcare providers  physician self referral arrangements  filing of false claims and other fraud and abuse issues 
federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit certain offers  payments or receipts of remuneration in return for i referring patients covered by medicare  medicaid or other federal health care program  or ii purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending any service  good  item or facility for which payment may be made by a federal health care program 
in addition  federal physician self referral legislation  commonly known as the stark law  generally prohibits a physician from ordering certain services reimbursable by medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare program from any entity with which the physician has a financial relationship 
while providers who license our protocols currently do not seek such third party reimbursement for treatment using our protocols  we anticipate they may do so in the future 
in addition  many states have similar laws  some of which are not limited to services reimbursed by federal healthcare programs 
other federal and state laws govern the submission of claims for reimbursement  or false claims laws 
one of the most prominent of these laws is the federal false claims act 
in recent cases  the government has taken the position that violations of other laws  such as the anti kickback laws or the fda prohibitions against promotion of off label uses of drugs  may cause the filing of claims that should also be prosecuted as violations of the false claims act 

table of contents while we believe we have structured our relationships to comply with all applicable requirements  federal or state authorities may claim that our fee arrangements  agreements and relationships with contractors  hospitals and physicians violate these anti kickback  self referral or false claims laws and regulations 
these laws are broadly worded and have been broadly interpreted by courts 
it is often difficult to predict how these laws will be applied  and they potentially subject many typical business arrangements to government investigation and prosecution  which can be costly and time consuming 
violations of these laws are punishable by monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from participation in government sponsored health care programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws 
some states also have similar anti kickback and self referral laws  imposing substantial penalties for violations 
if our business practices are found to violate any of these provisions  we may be unable to continue with our relationships or implement our business plans  which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to healthcare anti fraud initiatives  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business state and federal governments are devoting increased attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers  taking an expansive definition of fraud that includes receiving fees in connection with a healthcare business that is found to violate any of the complex regulations described above 
recent legislation expanded the penalties for heath care fraud  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicare  medicaid and other healthcare programs 
while to our knowledge we have not been the subject of any anti fraud investigations  if such a claim were made defending our business practices could be time consuming and expensive  and an adverse finding could result in substantial penalties or require us to restructure our operations  which we may not be able to do successfully 
our use and disclosure of patient information is subject to privacy regulations  which may result in increased costs in conducting research or providing administrative services to healthcare providers in connection with the use of our protocols  we may collect  use  maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state  federal and international laws and regulations govern the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of and related rules  or hipaa 
the three rules that were promulgated pursuant to hipaa that could most significantly affect our business are the standards for electronic transactions  or transactions rule  the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy rule  and the health insurance reform security standards  or security rule 
the respective compliance dates for these rules for most entities were and are october   april  and april  hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most healthcare facilities and health plans that will contract for the use of our protocols and our services 
the hipaa rules require covered entities to bind contractors like hythiam to compliance with certain burdensome hipaa rule requirements 
other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy of patient information also apply to our customers directly and to us  either directly or indirectly 
the hipaa transactions rule establishes format and data content standards for eight of the most common healthcare transactions 
when we perform billing and collection services on behalf of our customers we may be engaging in one of more of these standard transactions and will be required to conduct those transactions in compliance with the required standards 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  requires entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored 
table of contents electronically 
we may be required to make costly system purchases and modifications to comply with the hipaa rule requirements that will be imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the federal trade commission  or ftc  and state attorneys general to regulate the collection  use and disclosure of personal or patient information  through web sites or otherwise  and to regulate the presentation of web site content 
courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the ftc  which concern consumer notice  choice  security and access 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of patient information 
these laws in many cases are not preempted by the hipaa rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense  adverse publicity and liability 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use and transmission of personal or patient information and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa  congressional action or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle health care related data  and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant 
if we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information in conducting research or providing services we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions 
we may not be able to profitably adapt to the changing healthcare and substance dependence treatment industry  which may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity healthcare organizations  public and private  continue to change the manner in which they operate and pay for services 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of government regulation of reimbursement rates and capital expenditures  among other things 
for example  while we do not believe it will impact our operations because providers do not currently seek medicare reimbursement for treatment using our protocols  the recently enacted medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of changes substantially the way medicare will pay for prescription drugs and also creates or reforms other healthcare reimbursement 
proposals to reform the healthcare system have been considered by congress and state legislatures 
any new legislative initiatives  if enacted  may further increase government regulation of or other involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for healthcare companies 
we cannot predict the likelihood of all future changes in the healthcare industry in general  or the substance dependence treatment industry in particular  or what impact they may have on our earnings  financial condition or business 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may be subject to substantial volatility  and you may lose all or a substantial part of your investment our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
there is a limited public float  and trading volume historically has been limited and sporadic 
over the last year  our common stock traded between and per share on limited and sporadic volume ranging from zero to  shares per day 
as a result  the current price for our common stock on the nasdaq is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our fair market value 
the price at which our common stock will trade may be highly volatile and may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  without limitation  the number of shares available for sale in the market  quarterly variations in our operating results and actual or anticipated announcements of new products or services by us or competitors  regulatory investigations or determinations  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  recruitment or departures of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in the estimates of our operating performance  market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 

table of contents the company is controlled by a single principal stockholder who has the ability to determine the election of directors and the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders as of march   reserva  llc  a limited liability company whose sole managing member is terren s 
peizer  our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially owned  shares  which represent approximately of our  shares of outstanding common stock 
as a result  he presently and may continue to have the ability to determine or significantly influence the election of our board of directors and the outcome of all other issues submitted to our stockholders 
the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and it may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 
one consequence to this substantial stockholder s control is that it may be difficult for investors to remove management of the company 
it could also deter unsolicited takeovers  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could discourage a change in control  and adversely affect existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company  even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue one or more series of preferred stock  which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock 
delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with interested stockholders 
these provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
these provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not intend to do so we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends 
payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition  results of operations and capital requirements  as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
we may incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted or proposed by the securities and exchange commission and by nasdaq  will result in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of any new rules and respond to their requirements 
new rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with any new rules and regulations 
item property our principal executive offices  including all of our sales  marketing and administrative functions  are located in leased office space of approximately  square feet in los angeles  california 
the lease commenced on december   and has an initial base rent of approximately  per month  subject to annual adjustment over its seven year term 
we plan to lease an additional approximately  square feet in in near proximity to our executive offices to accommodate our general and administrative needs for the next twelve months 
as we expand  we may lease additional regional office facilities  as necessary  to service our customer base
