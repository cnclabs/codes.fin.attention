the following should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview our earnings and cash flows are heavily dependent on financial market conditions 
significant increases or decreases in the various securities markets  particularly equity markets  can have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we derive our revenues primarily from providing investment management  distribution  and administrative services to the funds and institutional and separately managed accounts 
investment management fees  our most substantial source of revenues  are based on the amount of average assets under management and are affected by sales levels  financial market conditions  redemptions  and the composition of assets 
underwriting and distribution revenues  another substantial source of revenues  consist of commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products  distribution fees on certain variable products and fees earned on fee based asset allocation products  as well as advisory services 
the products sold have various commission structures and the revenues received from sales of products vary based on the type and amount sold 
rule b distribution fees earned for distributing certain mutual fund shares are based upon a percentage of assets and fluctuate based on sales  redemptions  and financial market conditions 
service fees include transfer agency fees  custodian fees for retirement plan accounts  and portfolio accounting 
our distinct business model helped us achieve a solid year 
during  in the advisors channel we focused our efforts on improving advisor productivity  improving retention and increasing headcount 
we introduced a new fee based asset allocation product  managed allocation portfolio map  structured and priced to be competitive with other products offered in the industry 
additionally  to aid our advisors as they strive to stay abreast of the ever changing financial landscape  we deployed four wholesalers devoted to the securian and legend sales forces to also lend support to our proprietary sales force in the advisors channel 
these wholesalers provide our advisors with precise  specialized product details and sales insight  making our advisors more competitive and valuable to their clients 
finally  we have fully implemented core  a state of the art comprehensive client relationship management system used by our advisors to significantly enhance client services 
our advisors are better prepared than ever to provide a full spectrum of financial planning services  built around four complete fund families comprising mutual funds with investment styles and annuities and insurance products 
the breadth and depth of the products offered by our advisors has never been stronger 
during  we made significant progress in our non proprietary distribution efforts within our wholesale channel 
we continued our strategy to build relationships with key broker dealers  registered investment advisors and third party retirement plan administrators 
we also made significant strides in placing our funds within important national retail and fee based programs 
a wholesaling staff of external wholesalers  assisted by internal wholesalers and key account representatives  supports this effort 
this year represented the first full year of distribution of the re launched ivy funds through non proprietary channels  and the results achieved were noteworthy 
during  our non proprietary distribution efforts resulted in gross sales of billion  exceeding the billion threshold 
net sales were also very strong at million for the year  representing an organic growth rate of  which we believe compares favorably within our public asset manager peer group 
our institutional efforts  also included within the wholesale channel  were somewhat subdued compared to last year s strong sales results  nonetheless  this effort yielded gross sales of billion during  or of total sales 
at the heart of our business is our investment management division 
we have a seasoned team of portfolio managers who average years of industry experience and years of tenure with us 
generally  portfolio managers have had extensive experience as investment research analysts prior to acquiring portfolio management assignments 
they have substantial resources available to them  including the efforts of equity and fixed income analysts who conduct primary fundamental research including numerous on and off site meetings annually with management of the companies in which they invest 
in addition  we use research provided by brokerage firms and independent outside consultants 
portfolio managers participate in a collaborative process that blends their individual accountability with the ideas of their peers  which when supported by an intensive research capability supports our efforts to deliver consistent long term performance 
we have significant experience in broad asset classes  each involving multiple investment management styles 
our investment strategy generally emphasizes investments at attractive valuations in companies that the portfolio managers believe can produce above average growth in earnings 
our portfolio managers also strive for consistent long term performance while seeking to provide downside protection in turbulent markets 
our investment philosophy lends itself well to the financial planning approach used in our advisors channel while our consistent long term investment performance record supports our distribution efforts in our wholesale channel 
our advisors channel s focus is on financial planning  providing clients with advice and in depth financial planning services 
our wholesale distribution channel encompasses garnering institutional assets for which we provide investment management services and offering our funds for sale in non proprietary distribution outlets and through legend retirement advisors 
as a result of our investment philosophy and results  our advisor channel has developed a loyal customer base with clients maintaining their accounts for approximately years on average as compared to years for the mutual fund industry  as derived from statistics provided by the investment company institute 
the investment performance delivered by our investment management team continues to improve 
the percentage of equity funds that rank in lipper s top quartile and top half  whether you look at the one  three or five year periods is approaching the best we have experienced 
the same holds true for our morningstar rankings 
for the year ended december   of our equity funds ranked in the top quartile and ranked in the top half according to lipper 
for the three and five years ended december   and of our equity funds ranked in the top quartile and top half while  and of our equity funds ranked in the top quartile and top half  respectively 
looking ahead to  in the advisors channel we intend to focus on improvements in the productivity and retention of our financial advisors  as well as expanding our sales force 
we have a strong foundation in place to achieve these goals 
our financial advisors now have a broader array of product choices and investment styles 
they also have a new comprehensive client relationship management system to significantly enhance client services 
we will also continue to leverage our wholesaling activities in the advisors channel to provide sales support and strategies 
in the wholesale channel  we intend to continue building on the momentum that has developed in through focused  target strategic marketing efforts with a greater concentration on a limited number of distributors 
results of operations compared to net income for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share compared to million  or per diluted share for the same period in the increase in net income of approximately million was primarily a result of charges recorded during in march of  we completed a tender offer to exchange certain out of the money employee stock options for an economically equivalent grant of restricted stock 
this resulted in a charge of approximately million million after tax in the first quarter of also  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million million after tax for estimated damages and legal costs for both the third quarter of and future legal costs in connection with the uilic litigation  the nasd sales practice exam and ongoing disputes with former sales personnel in our advisors channel 
exclusive of the charges for the tender offer and legal costs  net income increased by million over last year 
total revenues the following table summarizes our total revenues for the year ended variance amount percentage in thousands  except percentage data investment management fees    underwriting and distribution fees    shareholder service fees    total revenues    of the million increase in total revenues in  over half  or million  was attributable to an increase in revenues from investment management fees received on retail mutual fund average net assets 
additionally  growth in sales at legend had a positive impact on total underwriting and distribution revenues  contributing an increase of approximately million from last year 
furthermore  reorganization in the structure of mutual fund shareholder service fees effective july  due to growth in the number of mutual fund portfolios and assets serviced contributed million to the increase in shareholder service fee revenue for investment management fee revenues investment management fee revenues are earned for providing investment advisory services to the funds and to institutional and separate accounts  and accounted for and of total revenues for the years ended and  respectively 
investment management fee revenues increased million  or  in a significant majority of investment management fee revenues   are earned from portfolio management services provided to the funds 
revenues from the management of institutional and separate accounts make up the remaining portion 
revenues from the management of the funds increased million  or  to million as the funds average assets under management increased to billion 
while the primary factor for growth in the funds average assets under management is attributed to the improvement in the equity markets during as evidenced by the increase in the s p  the strategic alliance with securian  which brought in billion of assets under management during the third and fourth quarters of  also contributed to the increase in average assets in during  we observed a shift in the composition of mutual fund assets under management  moving away from fixed income funds toward equity funds  which generally carry a higher management fee rate 
we attribute this shift to investors renewed interest in the equity markets after several years of a downturn 
this shift accounted for approximately million in revenue growth from the funds for revenues from the management advisory services for institutional and separate accounts increased to million in institutional and separate account business growth  by nature  is sporadic  and is typically attained in large blocks less frequently than our retail mutual fund business 
in  we saw growth in institutional and separate account average assets under management due mostly to market appreciation 
the long term redemption rate  which includes our funds and institutional and separate accounts but excludes money market fund redemptions  was  essentially flat compared to last year s rate of 
we also track the redemption rate by the two channels of distribution 
the advisors channel long term redemption rate hit a five year high in at  but improved slightly in  decreasing to 
the long term redemption rate of the wholesale channel decreased slightly from in to in we expect the advisors channel long tem redemption rate to remain lower than that of the wholesale channel due to the personal and customized nature in which our financial advisors provide service to their clients 
underwriting and distribution revenues and expenses the advisors channel is the primary source of underwriting and distribution revenue  as most of the mutual fund shares sold in the wholesale channel are sold on a load waived basis  with the exception of investment product sales by the legend retirement advisors 
the majority of underwriting and distribution fee revenues are derived from sales commissions charged on front end load products sold by our financial advisors that include mutual fund class a shares those sponsored by the company and those underwritten by other non proprietary mutual fund companies  variable annuities  and financial planning fees 
to a lesser extent  underwriting and distribution revenues are received from rule b asset based distribution fees earned on deferred load products sold by our financial advisors and third party intermediaries in our wholesale channel  asset based fees earned on our asset allocation products  and commissions earned on the sale of other insurance products 
we divide the costs of underwriting and distribution into two components direct costs and indirect costs 
direct costs of selling fluctuate with sales volume such as advisor commissions and commission overrides paid to field management  advisor incentive compensation  and commissions paid to third parties in our wholesale channel 
indirect costs are discretionary costs that do not tend to fluctuate in correlation with sales levels and are therefore more fixed in nature 
indirect costs include expenses incurred by our home office and field offices related to costs of marketing  promoting and distributing our products through both the advisors channel and the wholesale channel  costs of managing and supporting our financial advisors such as overhead expenses relating to field offices  sales programs  and technology infrastructure  and costs of managing and supporting our wholesale efforts for technology infrastructure and personnel 
we recover certain of our underwriting and distribution costs through rule b service and or distribution fees  which are paid by the funds 
rule b service and distribution fees are received predominantly from the advisors funds class a shares under a sales and servicing reimbursement plan agreement  which allows reimbursement to us from the advisors funds class a shares of certain rule b eligible expenses  not to exceed a maximum of basis points of average daily net assets under management 
we recognize the reimbursement paid by the advisors funds class a shares monthly as a reduction to rule b eligible expenses paid by us on the mutual fund s behalf 
we also have a compensatory rule b service and or distribution plan for the ivy funds  target funds  invested  and advisor funds  excluding class a shares  which is recorded in a similar manner 
total rule b fees collected from the funds and offset against related expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

offsetting larger sales of proprietary class a shares  sales of variable annuity products were down from last year  which resulted in a million decrease in revenue 
revenues earned on the sale of insurance products by our financial advisors decreased during resulting in a million  or  decline from last year 
the current environment of low interest rates had a negative impact on fixed annuity insurance sales and competitive pricing pressure in the long term care sector of the industry negatively impacted sales of these insurance products in the following table illustrates commissionable proprietary investment product sales by our financial advisors  including sales of our invested portfolios

asset based fees earned on our allocation products were million  declining million  or  from last year directly corresponding to a decrease in average assets under management in asset allocation products 
underwriting and distribution expenses of the advisors channel increased million  or  to million in direct expenses were up million  or  to million primarily due to higher commissions resulting from increased sales of front end load products 
commissions for the sale of front end load products increased million  or  fluctuating directly with the increase in the revenue earned from front end load sales 
higher amortization of class b and class c deferred selling costs in contributed million to the overall increase in direct expenses 
partially offsetting the increase in direct expenses resulting from the sale of front end load products and higher amortization was a million decrease in commission expense from insurance sales due to lower sales of these products in and lower commissions from our asset allocation products of million compared to indirect expenses increased million  slightly less than from last year as a savings of million from the reorganization of certain field offices was offset by a million increase in expense for an advisor incentive compensation program implemented effective january  for the top performing advisors 
during  our advisor productivity level increased to thousand per advisor 
we are targeting a annual growth in the number of financial advisors over the long term 
wholesale channel revenues earned in the wholesale channel increased million  or  to million 
the majority of the increase is attributable to revenue earned by legend 
legend contributed million to wholesale channel revenue  an increase of million  or  from last year 
legend s commission revenues grew million  or  primarily due to a growth in sales volume  while b revenue was million higher than last year 
legend s advisory fee revenues increased million  or  as a result of growth in average assets with asset based advisory fees 
while the majority of mutual fund sales through non proprietary third parties are load waived  we do receive commissions in certain limited situations  which increased million in underwriting and distribution expenses of the wholesale channel increased million  or  to million in direct expenses increased million  or  due in part to the growth in investment product sales at legend during and in part to a full year of expenses associated with asset based fees 
sales growth at legend resulted in an increase to direct selling commission expenses of million  or  from last year 
direct costs from asset based fees on variable annuities resulting from our strategic alliance with securian increased million from commissions paid to our wholesalers for sales of the ivy funds increased million 
as sales of ivy funds class b and class c shares picked up in  amortization of deferred selling costs increased million from last year 
indirect expenses increased million  or  from primarily due to a full year of costs for our continued effort to develop non proprietary distribution efforts within the wholesale channel 
these efforts demonstrated significant growth this year  non proprietary distribution of ivy funds yielded gross sales of billion in a full year of costs associated with marketing and distributing the ivy funds  including sales brochures  prospectuses and other publicity  training for wholesalers  business meetings and travel expenses  systems support  and the addition of employees during  including internal and external wholesalers and support staff  collectively contributed almost entirely to the increase in indirect expenses 
shareholder service fee revenues shareholder service fee revenues primarily include transfer agency fees  custodian fees from retirement plan accounts  and portfolio accounting and administration fees 
in  shareholder service fee revenue increased to million due in part to an increase in the average number of shareholder accounts for which transfer agency fees are charged  the growth in assets in shareholder accounts for which certain other fees are based  and to a change in the structure of portfolio asset based fees that are charged for accounting and administrative services provided to the funds 
transfer agency fees  which comprised approximately of total shareholder service fee revenue and are based on annual charges per shareholder account  increased million  or  due to a increase in the average number of shareholder accounts during the average number of shareholder accounts grew to million in compared to million in as the ivy accounts were added to our shareholder system in june and securian accounts were added in december asset based fees for mutual fund portfolio accounting and administration were million in  an increase of million from effective july   due to the growth in the number of mutual fund portfolios and assets serviced  we implemented a change to the rate structure of the accounting service fee for certain administrative costs  such as services provided to the funds including  but not limited to  preparation of regulatory filings and blue sky filings  legal services  and other types of internal reporting 
approximately of the increase in portfolio accounting service fee revenue is attributed to the rate structure change effective july   while the remainder is attributed to growth in assets 
custodian fees were essentially unchanged compared to total operating expenses the following table summarizes our total operating expenses for the year ended variance amount percentage in thousands  except percentage data underwriting and distribution    compensation and related costs    equity compensation    general and administrative    subadvisory fees    depreciation    total operating expenses    the decrease in total operating expenses of million  or  in is principally due to decreases in equity compensation and general and administrative expenses  offset by increases in underwriting and distribution expenses discussed above

exclusive of these temporary costs  compensation and related expense increased million 
base salaries and payroll taxes were up million  or  exclusive of the temporary transition costs  while our average employee headcount was up from incentive compensation increased million primarily due to investment performance compensation paid to employees of the investment adviser 
equity compensation equity compensation includes expenses incurred due to the granting of restricted stock awards as part of our overall compensation program to attract and retain key personnel and encourage a greater personal financial investment in the company 
restricted stock awards are expensed on a straight line basis over a four year vesting period  with the exception of the restricted stock issued in the stock option tender offer discussed below 
on february   the company made a tender offer to exchange certain out of the money stock options for an economically equivalent grant of restricted stock in an effort to reduce the total number of options outstanding  and improve our ability to retain key employees 
option values for various strike prices were determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
option values were then divided by the company s share price on the date of the tender offer to determine an equivalent fraction of a restricted share to be issued for each option tendered 
the company issued a total of  shares of restricted stock in connection with the tender offer 
of the total number of shares of restricted stock issued  the company repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million from the participants to pay individual income tax liabilities 
as a result   net shares of restricted stock were issued 
all shares of restricted stock issued pursuant to the tender offer were issued under the company s stock incentive plan and are fully vested  but remain subject to transfer restrictions 
equity compensation for the year ended december  decreased million from last year to million for in  we recorded a one time charge of million million after tax to equity compensation due to the tender offer that resulted in the issuance of fully vested restricted shares 
equity compensation for and included approximately million and million  respectively  primarily related to amortization expense of regular restricted stock awards granted during each of the years since that carry a four year vesting period and are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period

these other asset managers  in most cases  were subadvising the managed assets prior to our acquisition and specialize in investment styles not offered by the company 
gross management fees earned from these assets are included as part of management fee revenues discussed above 
the growth in these subadvised funds has been significant during the year

the transfer of investment securities resulted in the recognition of an unrealized gain of million 
investment income in included a gain of million from the sale of mutual funds  net of other investment losses 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or  to million for compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to a reduction of million in savings in the current year from the interest rate swap on long term debt due to the rise in the short term interest rate markets 
the interest rate swap agreement was entered into in march of  and effectively converted our fixed rate debt to variable debt 
interest savings as a result of the swap agreement were million during and million during at december   the floating interest rate paid on long term debt as a result of our interest rate swap was compared to at december  average borrowings on money market loans were higher by million when comparing periods  with a slight increase in average interest rates from to in  resulting in a increase in interest expense compared to total average debt outstanding in was million compared to million in our overall average interest rate  which includes other borrowing costs such as commitment fees  was compared to for income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended was compared to for the prior year

overall management fee rates increased to basis points in compared to basis points in primarily due to a mix shift towards equity products in our mutual funds and higher management fee rates on some of the funds acquired

in addition  the company recorded a million charge in for the cost of the payment of the compensatory damage and attorney s fees portion of the award against us in the nasd arbitration with a former financial advisor 
excluding these charges  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to the inclusion of temporary iico general and administrative costs in  an increase in insurance costs  and the inclusion of costs associated with the launch of the new ivy funds family

on january   the ny supreme court ordered the appeal bond released as a result of the award being reversed and vacated  however  we remain subject to the collateral requirements of the standby letter of credit because the issuer of the appeal bond has yet to release the bank of their obligation under the letter of credit agreement

as in the past  any bond posted would be satisfied with a combination of current liquidity and borrowings on our money market loan program 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we rely on historical experience  third party professionals  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  pension and postretirement benefits  deferred sales commissions  valuation of investments  and litigation contingencies 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
additionally  see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies 
accounting for intangible assets and goodwill as of december  our total intangible assets and goodwill was million  or  of our total assets 
two significant considerations arise with respect to these assets that require management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation of impairment 
in connection with all of our acquisitions  an evaluation is completed to determine reasonable purchase price allocations 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgments as to expectations for the various products  distribution channels  and business strategies 
for example  certain growth rates and operating margins were assumed for different products and distribution channels 
if actual growth rates or operating margins  among other assumptions  differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill could be subject to charges for impairment in the future 
we complete an ongoing review of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets using a fair value based approach on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the approach for the review of goodwill has two steps  the first being to identify a potential impairment and the second being to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets with indefinite lives  primarily mutual fund advisory contracts to manage assets obtained through acquisitions  are tested for impairment annually using a one step approach that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
we consider mutual fund advisory contracts indefinite lived intangible assets as they are expected to be renewed without significant cost or modification of terms 
factors that are considered important in determining whether an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets might exist include significant continued underperformance compared to peers  the likelihood of termination or non renewal of a mutual fund advisory or subadvisory contract or substantial changes in revenues earned from such contracts  significant changes in our business and products  material and ongoing negative industry or economic trends  or other factors specific to each asset or subsidiary being evaluated 
because of the significance of goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated balance sheets  the annual impairment analysis is critical 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a detailed evaluation was performed as of june  as a result of these analyses  it was determined that no impairment of goodwill or other intangibles existed as the fair value of each business unit exceed its carrying value 
see note goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our estimate of taxable income for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  including the determination of any valuation allowances that might be required for deferred tax assets 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of the current reporting period based on our belief that operating income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trend of positive operating income changes  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
pensions and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for other postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
we use certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the selection of i the discount rate used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  ii the expected return on plan assets  and iii the expected health care cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption is based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during the year 
the expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected future market conditions 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates  future pension costs and funding requirements may change materially 
deferred sales commissions we pay upfront sales commissions to our financial advisors and third party intermediary broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of mutual fund shares sold without a front end sales charge 
these costs are capitalized and amortized over the period during which the shareholder is subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  not to exceed five years 
we recover these costs through rule b distribution plan payments fees  which are paid by the applicable share classes of the advisors funds  ivy funds  and invested funds  along with contingent deferred sales charges paid by shareholders who redeem their shares prior to completion of the required holding periods 
should we lose our ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and contingent deferred sales charges  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
we periodically review the recoverability of deferred sales commission assets as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of deferred sales commission assets may not be recoverable and adjust the deferred sales commissions assets accordingly 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income  in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of the other than temporary decline in the value of our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
litigation contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records an accrual for losses related to litigation at such time an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount of the range will be recorded 
in addition  it is the company s policy to include legal costs  net of expected insurance recoveries  that it expects to incur in connection with a loss contingency as part of the loss contingency charge 
see note contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of legal proceedings 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas r provides investors and other users of financial statements with more complete and neutral financial information by requiring public companies to recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions in their financial statements 
using a modified version of prospective application  compensation cost will be recognized on or after the effective date for the portion of all outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered 
compensation cost will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
entities electing to apply a modified version of retrospective application for periods prior to the required effective date will adjust results on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures previously made under sfas no 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
the cumulative effect of initially applying this statement  if any  is recognized as of the required effective date 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  we will adopt sfas r on july  using the prospective method of accounting 
based on the number of stock options outstanding as of december   the effect of the adoption of sfas r would be to increase equity compensation expense by approximately million in the second half of had we implemented the provisions of sfas no 
as revised for the years ended december   and  diluted earnings per share would have been reduced to  and  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and sfas r 
sfas r revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans and requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
this amendment to sfas was adopted by the company in in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities as revised in december  fin r 
this interpretation changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
an entity is subject to fin r and is called a variable interest entity vie if it has i equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or ii equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations  or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity 
a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary  which is the party involved with the vie that is expected to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin r apply to all vies created after january  for vies that existed prior to february   the provisions of fin r are generally effective beginning with the first interim or annual period ending after december  as of december   fin r has not had an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonability and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations 
risk factors regulatory risk is substantial in our business 
non compliance with regulations or changes in regulations could have a significant impact on the conduct of our business and our prospects  revenues and earnings 
our investment management business is heavily regulated  primarily at the federal level 
non compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against us  including fines and censures  suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses 
see item legal proceedings for a more complete description of these matters 
non compliance with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation  prospects  revenues  and earnings 
in addition  changes in current legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  or compliance requirements or in governmental policies could adversely affect our operations  revenues  and earnings by increasing expenses and reducing investor interest in certain products offered by the company  among other things 
we are at risk of litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and adversely impact our earnings 
the company announced on october  that it was recording a charge of million million after tax to recognize liabilities for estimated damages and legal costs in connection with the uilic litigation  the nasd action  and ongoing disputes with former sales personnel  including the sawtelle arbitration as referenced in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in this charge were third quarter legal expenses related to these matters 
actual damages for these litigation matters potentially could exceed our recorded estimates of damages for the litigation charge 
these matters and other legal matters could result in additional costs to the company and divert resources and management s attention from operations 
such additional costs and diversions could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings for a more complete description of these matters 
we could experience adverse effects on our revenues  profits and market share due to strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with stock brokerage firms  investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  internet investment sites  and other financial institutions and individual registered investment advisers 
many of these companies not only offer mutual fund investments and services but also offer an ever increasing number of other financial products and services 
many of our competitors have more products and product lines  services  and brand recognition and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
many larger mutual fund complexes have developed relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks  which may enable those fund complexes to reach broader client bases 
in recent years  there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than us 
there has also been a trend toward online internet financial services 
if existing or potential customers decide to invest with our competitors instead of with us  our market share  revenues  and income could decline 
the terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations that may adversely impact our prospects and the operations of our business 
there are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital if needed which could negatively impact our liquidity  prospects and operations 
we have entered into a day revolving credit facility with various lenders for a total of million  whereby the lenders could  at their option upon our request  expand the facility to million 
in august  we also began using money market loans  which function similarly to commercial paper 
at december   there was no balance outstanding under the line of credit and the outstanding balance related to the money market loans was million 
the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility and the money market loans impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  make capital expenditures and acquisitions  merge  sell assets  pay dividends  and create or incur liens 
our ability to comply with the financial covenants set forth in the credit facility can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that will comply with such terms and conditions  a breach of which could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the banks could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility  all interest thereon  and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
our ability to meet our cash needs and satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  asset values  perception of our creditworthiness  and indirectly  the market value of our stock 
these factors will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other circumstances  some of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that borrowings from our existing credit facility or its refinancing  money market loans  and or cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our business plans  meet our operating expenses  and service our debt obligations as they become due 
however  in the event that we require additional capital  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our credit facility upon its maturity or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plan 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
there are no assurances that we will pay future dividends which could adversely affect our stock price 
our board of directors currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on our class a common stock  however  the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board 
any determination as to the payment of dividends  as well as the level of such dividends  will depend on  among other things  general economic and business conditions  our strategic plans  our financial results and condition  and contractual  legal  and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and  as such  our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash 
there can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends in any future period s 
any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect our stock price 
our ability to hire and retain key personnel and financial advisors is significant to our success and growth 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct our fund management and investment advisory business 
the market for qualified fund managers  investment analysts  and financial advisors is extremely competitive 
we are dependent on our financial advisors and select wholesale distributors to sell our mutual funds and other investment products 
our growth prospects will be directly affected by the quality  quantity  and productivity of financial advisors we are able to successfully recruit and retain 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel 
there may be adverse effects on our revenues and earnings if our funds performance declines 
success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts relative to market conditions and the performance of competing funds 
good relative performance stimulates sales of the funds shares and tends to keep redemptions low 
sales of the funds shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues 
good relative performance also attracts institutional and separate accounts 
conversely  poor relative performance results in decreased sales  increased redemptions of the funds shares and the loss of institutional and separate accounts  resulting in decreases in revenues 
failure of our funds to perform well could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
our revenues  earnings and prospects could be adversely affected if the securities markets decline 
our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors  including the level of the securities markets 
these adverse economic factors may be exacerbated by war or terrorism 
as a result of the significant declines in the securities markets and highly publicized financial scandals during and and the market timing and late trading issues within the mutual fund industry during  investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets 
the existence of adverse market conditions and lack of investor confidence  together with uncertainty surrounding terrorist threats and geopolitical tensions could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment  either of which could adversely affect our revenues  earnings  and growth prospects 
because our revenues are  to a large extent  investment management fees based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of these assets adversely affects our revenues 
our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets  and in an adverse economic environment  this may prove difficult 
our growth rate has varied from year to year and there can be no assurance that the average growth rates sustained in the recent past will continue 
the combination of adverse markets reducing sales and investment management fees could compound on each other and materially affect earnings 
adverse conditions in the us domestic stock market are particularly material to us due to high concentration of assets under management in that market 
systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our clients 
our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems  including our mutual fund transfer agency system maintained by a third party service provider 
we are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and the proper functioning of computer systems of third parties 
we rely heavily on financial  accounting  and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to expand could be affected 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot be sure that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by a fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
potential misuse of funds and information in the possession of our employees and or advisors could result in liability to our clients and subject us to regulatory sanctions 
our financial advisors handle a significant amount of funds for our clients as well as financial and personal information 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate or that a taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors  can be prevented 
we could have liability in the event of a taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions 
although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any future liability 
there may be an adverse effect on our revenues and profits if our investors remove the assets we manage on short notice 
a majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with our funds that  as required by law  are terminable on days notice 
each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund s board or its shareholders  as required by law 
some of these investment management agreements may be terminated or may not be renewed  and new agreements may be unavailable 
in addition  mutual fund investors may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without any prior notice 
investors can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  and financial market performance 
the decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stockholders rights plan could deter takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may believe to be in their best interest 
under certain conditions  the rights under our stockholders rights plan entitle the holders of such rights to receive shares of our class a common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right 
the rights are attached to each share of our outstanding class a common stock and generally are exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of the voting power represented by our class a common stock 
our stockholders rights plan could impede the completion of a merger  tender offer  or other takeover attempt even though some or a majority of our stockholders might believe that a merger  tender offer  or takeover is in their best interests  and even if such a transaction could result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares of our stock over the then current market price of our stock 
provisions of our organizational documents could deter takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may believe to be in their best interest 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board has the authority  without action by our stockholders  to fix certain terms and issue shares of our preferred stock  par value per share 
actions of our board pursuant to this authority may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of the company 
other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and in our bylaws impose procedural and other requirements that could be deemed to have anti takeover effects  including replacing incumbent directors 
our board is divided into three classes  each of which is to serve for a staggered three year term after the initial classification and election  and incumbent directors may not be removed without cause  all of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board 
in addition  as a delaware corporation we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
with certain exceptions  section imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our voting stock 
our holding company structure results in structural subordination and may affect our ability to fund our operations and make payments on our debt 
we are a holding company and  accordingly  substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flow and our ability to service our debt  including million of our senior notes  is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries  and we are dependent on the distribution of earnings  loans  or other payments by our subsidiaries to us 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans  or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans  or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization  and therefore the right of the holders of our debt to participate in those assets  would be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors 
in addition  even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries  our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments with certain inherent market risks  primarily related to interest rates and securities prices 
the principal risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed relate to interest rates on debt and marketable securities 
generally  these instruments have not been entered into for trading purposes 
management actively monitors these risk exposures  however  fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
as a matter of policy  we only execute derivative transactions to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for speculative or trading purposes 
the following information  together with information included in other parts of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which are incorporated herein by reference  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to us 
interest rate sensitivity our interest sensitive liabilities include our long term fixed rate senior notes and obligations for any balances outstanding under our credit facility or other short term borrowings 
increases in market interest rates would generally cause a decrease in the fair value of the senior notes and an increase in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
decreases in market interest rates would generally cause an increase in the fair value of the senior notes and a decrease in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
based upon short term borrowings outstanding at december   a fluctuation in market rates would impact interest expense by approximately million annually 
based upon long term borrowings outstanding at december   a fluctuation in market rates would impact interest expense by approximately million annually 
on march   our million fixed rate senior notes maturing in january the notes were effectively converted to variable rate debt by entering into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we have agreed with another party to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and various floating rate interest amounts  calculated using a notional amount of million 
the difference in the floating rate interest paid and the fixed rate interest received is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense during the period that the related debt is outstanding 
as of december   the floating rate being paid was 
the average floating rate paid on the interest rate swap for the year ended december  was 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet by adjusting the carrying amounts of the notes by an offsetting amount for the swap 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we account for the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the notes 
this interest rate swap is considered effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the notes arising from changes in interest rates  and accordingly  there has been no impact on earnings resulting from any ineffectiveness associated with this transaction 
interest expense savings realized as a result of the hedge was approximately million  million  and million for years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   we have recorded a cumulative increase in other assets of million to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap and a cumulative increase in long term debt of million to reflect the fair value of the notes 
available for sale investments sensitivity we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
our portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade debt securities and equity mutual funds 
a substantial portion of investments are classified as available for sale investments pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and  are consequently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
any unrealized gain or loss is recognized upon the sale of the investment 
at any time  a sharp increase in interest rates or a sharp decline in the us stock market could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary by management  the cost basis of the individual security or mutual fund is written down to fair value as a new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
conversely  declines in interest rates or a significant rise in the us stock market could have a material positive impact on our investment portfolio 
however  unrealized gains are not recognized until the investment is sold 
we do not currently hedge these exposures 
securities price sensitivity our revenues are dependent on the underlying assets under management in the funds to which investment advisory services are provided 
the funds include portfolios of investments comprised of various combinations of equity  bond  and other types of securities 
fluctuations in the value of these securities are common and are generated by numerous factors  including  without limitation  market volatility  the overall economy  inflation  changes in investor strategies  availability of alternative investment vehicles  government regulations and others 
accordingly  declines in any one or a combination of these factors  or other factors not separately identified  may reduce the value of investment securities and  in turn  the underlying assets under management on which our revenues are earned 
these declines have an impact in our investment sales  thereby compounding the impact on our earnings
