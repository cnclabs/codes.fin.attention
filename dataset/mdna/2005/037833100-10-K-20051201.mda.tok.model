the company participates in several highly competitive markets  including personal computers with its macintosh line of computers  consumer electronics with its ipod line of digital music players  and distribution of third party digital content through its online itunes music store 
while the company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content  these are all highly competitive markets that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the company s management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments  warranty costs  and income taxes 
management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  peripherals  digital content  and service and support contracts 
the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped  and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the us  and for certain other sales  the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not  or is presumed not to be  fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs  including reseller and end user rebates  and other sales programs and volume based incentives 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the company has sold the product and committed to the relevant program 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company distributes its products through third party resellers and directly to certain education  consumer  and commercial customers 
the company generally does not require collateral from its customers 
however  when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america  europe  and asia and by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the company s direct customers 
these credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer 
as such  the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements 
however  considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral  third party flooring arrangements  or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of the company s distribution channels  and the aging of such receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition  if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the personal computer and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
the company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods ranging from to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified 
warranty costs the company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected cost per claim  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection  and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
the company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of  which  if implemented by the company  would affect the company s tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if the company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position

desktop net sales and unit sales increased by and  respectively  and ipod sales increased by during compared to the overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in portable system net sales during compared to  which the company believes might be attributable to a shift in sales from portables to the new imac g and mac mini  and a shift to the retail segment as a result of opening two additional stores in japan during japan s net sales and macintosh unit sales were down and  respectively  during compared to  which lagged behind all of the company s other operating segments 
these decreases in net sales and unit sales were believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the japan segment to the retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in japan in in addition  such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of quark xpress for mac os x  which did not occur until september the decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong ipod and ibook sales during compared to retail the company opened new retail stores during  including international stores in the u 
k  japan  and canada  bringing the total number of open stores to as of september  this compares to open stores as of september  and open stores as of september  net sales of the retail segment grew to billion during from billion and million in and  respectively

as measured by the company s operating segment reporting  the retail segment reported operating income of million during as compared to operating income of million during and an operating loss of million during this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment s year over year increase in average revenue per store  the impact of opening new stores  and the segment s year over year increase in net sales  which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy  depreciation  and other fixed costs 
expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure  operating lease commitments  personnel  and other operating expenses 
capital expenditures associated with the retail segment were million in  bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the retail segment to approximately million 
as of september   the retail segment had approximately  employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately million 
the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores 
such costs could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
gross margin gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows in millions  except gross margin percentages september  september  september  net sales cost of sales gross margin gross margin percentage gross margin increased in to of net sales from of net sales in the company s gross margin during increased due to more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including lcd flat panel displays and dram memory  an increase in higher margin software sales  a favorable shift in direct sales related primarily to the company s retail and online stores  and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs 
these increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin ipod sales 
the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure in light of price competition  especially for the ipod product line 
the company expects gross margin percentage to decline in the first quarter of primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as the ipod and content from the itunes music store 
the foregoing statements regarding the company s expected gross margin are forward looking 
there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products  including ipods  will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services  and potential changes to the company s product mix  including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins 
in response to these downward pressures  the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
due to the company s significant international operations  financial results can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components 
the company s operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
gross margin declined in to of net sales from of net sales in the company s gross margin during declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin ipod and ibook sales  pricing actions on certain power macintosh g models that were transitioned during the beginning of  higher warranty costs on certain portable macintosh products  and higher freight and duty costs during these unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a year over year increase in higher margin software sales

management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations 
however  the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty 
should any issues addressed in the company s tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations  the company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs 
on october   the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law

stock repurchase plan in july  the company s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock 
this repurchase plan does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time 
since inception of the stock repurchase plan  the company had repurchased a total of million shares at a cost of million 
the company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock during or the company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional million of its common stock as of september  on february   the company effected a two for one stock split to shareholders of record as of february  all share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments  or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the company

lease terms on the company s existing major facility operating leases range from to years 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers the company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the company s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company  which typically covers periods ranging from to days 
the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
as of september   the company had outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately billion 
subsequent to september   the company entered into long term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor  inc  intel corporation  micron technology  inc  samsung electronics co  ltd  and toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar year as part of these agreements  the company intends to prepay a total of billion for flash memory components by the end of the second quarter of asset retirement obligations the company s asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination

other obligations the company s other obligations of approximately million are primarily related to internet and telecommunications services 
indemnifications the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party 
however  the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third party and  in the opinion of management  does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition because of the following factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
general economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the company s products and the financial health of its suppliers  distributors  and resellers 
the company s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the us and abroad 
at times in the past  demand for the company s products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions 
additionally  some of the company s education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding 
although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery  continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the company s products and related operating results 
should global and or regional economic conditions deteriorate  demand for the company s products could be adversely affected  as could the financial health of its suppliers  distributors  and resellers 
war  terrorism  public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply  delivery or demand of products  which could negatively affect the company s operations and performance 
war  terrorism  public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the us or abroad  have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy  the company  and the company s suppliers or customers 
the company s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake  other natural disasters  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  labor disputes  public health issues  and other events beyond its control 
the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  information technology systems  and other critical business operations  including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses  the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 
although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events  such events could result in a decrease in demand for the company s products  make it difficult or impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers  and could create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain 
in addition  should major public health issues  including pandemics  arise  the company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions  additional limitations in the availability of freight services  governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions  delays in production ramps of new products  and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been  and in the future may be  adversely affected by these events 
the market for personal computers and related peripherals and services  as well as digital music devices and related services  is highly competitive 
if the company is unable to effectively compete in these markets  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  downward pressure on gross margins  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  evolving industry standards  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics  rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors  price sensitivity on the part of consumers  and a large number of competitors 
over the past several years  price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell windows and linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal computing products 
the company s results of operations and financial condition have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 
the personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality  hardware performance  and features based on existing or emerging industry standards 
further  as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet  an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the company s existing products 
several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company s key market segments  including consumer  education  professional and consumer digital video editing  and design and publishing 
several of the company s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products and or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design  technical features  and solutions of the company s products 
the company has a significant number of competitors  many of whom have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources  as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company 
additionally  there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the company s markets 
the company is currently the only maker of hardware using the mac os 
the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market  which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems  including windows and linux 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms 
additionally  if unauthorized copies of the mac os are used on other companies hardware products and result in decreased demand for the company s hardware products  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected 
the company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices  including ipods 
the company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products  including music enabled cell phones  distribution services  and free peer to peer music services 
these competitors include both new entrants with different market approaches  such as subscription services models  and also larger companies that may have greater technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than those of the company  as well as established hardware  software  and digital content supplier relationships 
failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the company s operating results and financial position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the us the company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and or increasing features which could adversely affect the company s music product gross margins as well as overall company gross margins 
the company also faces increased competition in the us education market 
us elementary and secondary schools  as well as college and university customers  remain a core market for the company 
uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers  which could negatively affect the company s market share 
in an effort to regain market share and remain competitive  the company has been and will continue to pursue one to one learning solutions in education 
learning solutions typically consist of ibook portable systems for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server 
these learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses  particularly for larger deals 
although the company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements 
failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s transition from powerpc microprocessors used by macintosh computers to microprocessors built by intel is subject to numerous risks 
in june  the company announced its intention to transition from the use of powerpc microprocessors to the use of intel microprocessors in all of its macintosh computers by the end of calendar year this transition is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the company s ability to timely develop and deliver new products using intel microprocessors  the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware and software products  including the company s applications  to support intel microprocessors  market acceptance of intel based macintosh computers  the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the company to timely deliver intel based macintosh computers  and the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand for both powerpc and intel based macintosh computers 
in addition  the company is dependent on third party software developers such as microsoft and adobe continuing to support current applications that run on powerpc based computers and timely developing versions of current and future applications that run on intel and powerpc based macintosh computers 
the company s inability to timely deliver new intel based products or obtain developer commitment both to continue supporting applications that run on powerpc microprocessors and timely transition their applications to run natively on intel based products may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s announcement of its intention to transition to intel microprocessors may negatively impact sales of current and future macintosh products containing powerpc microprocessors  as customers may elect to delay purchases until the intel based products are available 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its historical gross margin percentages on its products  including intel based macintosh computers  which may adversely impact the company s results of operations 
future operating results are dependent upon the company s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components  including microprocessors  some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources 
although most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources  certain key components including microprocessors and asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources 
some key components including without limitation dram  nand flash memory  and tft lcd flat panel displays  while currently available to the company from multiple sources  are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
in addition  new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for  and subsequently qualifies  additional suppliers 
in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies  initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured 
the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products 
the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics 
continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the company s requirements 
if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s ability to produce and market competitive products is dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and freescale semiconductor  inc freescale to supply powerpc microprocessors and intel to supply its microprocessors for the company s macintosh computers and to provide the company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the company s competitors 
while the company has supply agreements with ibm and freescale  the company s recent announcement of plans to transition to intel microprocessors may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services  including powerpc g and g microprocessors  which are essential to the company s business and are currently obtained by the company from sole or limited sources 
additionally  there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the company s suppliers to provide advanced powerpc microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
in addition  ibm is currently the company s sole supplier of the powerpc g processor  which is used in the company s current power mac  xserve  and imac g products 
freescale is the sole supplier of the g processor  which is used in the company s emac  mac mini  and portable products 
ibm experienced manufacturing problems with the powerpc g processor  which resulted in the company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of and the first quarter of manufacturing problems experienced by any of the company s suppliers in the future or failure by them to deliver components to the company in sufficient quantities with competitive price performance features could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand 
due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries  which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances  the company must continually introduce new products and technologies  enhance existing products in order to remain competitive  and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the company s existing products 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including market acceptance  the company s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions  including the transition to intel based macintosh computers  and production ramp issues  the availability of application software for new products  the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  including anticipated demand for powerpc based and intel based macintosh computers  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction 
accordingly  the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 
the company s products from time to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits 
the company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture 
sophisticated operating system software and applications  such as those sold by the company  often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software 
defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells 
failure to do so could result in lost revenue  loss of reputation  and significant warranty and other expense to remedy 
because orders for components  and in some cases commitments to purchase components  must be placed in advance of customer orders  the company faces substantial inventory risk 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled 
although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are currently adequate  given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the transition to intel based macintosh computers  no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges 
in addition  such charges have had  and may have  a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  and because of the transition to intel based macintosh computers  there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
consistent with industry practice  components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
the company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties  many of whom are located outside of the us most of the company s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers 
in addition  the company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations  they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered  or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company may remain at least initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition 
final assembly of products sold by the company is currently performed in the company s manufacturing facility in cork  ireland  and by external vendors in fremont  california  fullerton  california  taiwan  korea  the people s republic of china  and the czech republic 
currently  manufacturing of many of the components used in the company s products is performed by third party vendors in taiwan  china  japan  korea  and singapore 
final assembly of substantially all of the company s portable products including powerbooks  ibooks  and ipods is performed by third party vendors in china 
if for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic  business  labor  environmental  public health  or political issues  as well as information technology system failures or military actions  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the company s products 
the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  national and regional retailers  and cataloguers  many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers 
in addition  the company sells many of its products and resells certain third party products in most of its major markets directly to end users  certain education customers  and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores 
many of the company s resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by weak economic conditions over the last several years 
considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens  if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
the company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales  including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors 
these programs could require a substantial investment from the company  while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment 
over the past several years  an increasing proportion of the company s net sales has been made by the company directly to end users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the us  canada  japan  and the uk some of the company s resellers have perceived this expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products 
perception of such a conflict could discourage the company s resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the company s products 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the company s products 
further information regarding risks associated with marketing and distribution may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading markets and distribution 
the company relies on third party digital content  which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the company contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers through the company s itunes music store 
the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third party digital content 
the company s licensing arrangements with these third party content providers are short term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed alliances  which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the itunes music store 
further  some third party content providers currently  or may in the future  offer music products and services that compete with the company s music products and services  and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their digital content in the future 
if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules  or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the us  then sales and gross margins of the company s itunes music store as well as related hardware and peripherals  including ipods  may be adversely affected 
third party content providers and artists require that the company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms 
if the requirements from content providers or artists change  then the company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner  if at all  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial position 
the company s future performance is dependent upon support from third party software developers 
if third party software applications cease to be developed or available for the company s hardware products  then customers may choose not to buy the company s products 
the company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the company s personal computers  as opposed to windows based systems  are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications such as microsoft office 
the company also believes the availability of third party application software for the company s hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products versus software for the larger windows market or growing linux market 
this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated  continued acceptance by customers of mac os x  and the costs of developing such software products 
to the extent the minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market has caused software developers to question the company s prospects in the personal computer market  developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market or growing linux market 
moreover  there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x  the company s operating system  on a timely basis or at all 
in june  the company announced its plan to begin using intel microprocessors in its macintosh computers 
the company plans to begin shipping certain models with intel microprocessors by june and to complete this transition to intel microprocessors for all of its macintosh computers by the end of calendar year the company depends on third party software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run on intel and powerpc microprocessors 
the company s inability to timely deliver new intel based products  or a decline in available applications that run on the company s powerpc products or the lack of applications that run on intel based macintosh systems could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial position 
in addition  past and future development by the company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers  such as microsoft and adobe  to develop  maintain  and upgrade similar or competitive software for the company s products 
the company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals  consumers  and education customers that could influence the decisions of third party software developers to develop or upgrade macintosh compatible software products 
software applications currently marketed by the company include software for professional film and video editing  professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions  professional music production and music post production  professional and consumer dvd encoding and authoring  professional digital photo editing and workflow management  consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management  digital music management  desktop based database management  word processing  and high quality presentations 
the company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing  page layout  image manipulation  spreadsheets  databases  and presentations in a single application 
discontinuance of third party products for the macintosh platform  including microsoft office could have an adverse effect on the company s net sales and results of operations 
the company s business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties  and the company s future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 
many of the company s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods  the company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
however  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms 
because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is possible certain components of the company s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others 
the company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be time consuming  result in significant expenses  and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel 
several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation 
the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases 
however  no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a third party  the company s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in part i  item of this form k 
in the opinion of management  the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  or financial condition 
however  the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in part i  item of this form k or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
the company s retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
through october  the company had opened retail stores 
the company s retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements  information systems  inventory  and personnel 
the company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from to years  the majority of which are for years 
the company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores 
such costs could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  a relatively high proportion of the retail segment s costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense 
as a result  significant losses would result should the retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason 
certain of the company s stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing  corporate events  and brand awareness 
because of their unique design elements  locations and size  these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the company s more typical retail stores 
the company has opened seven such stores through october because of their location and size  these high profile stores also require the company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores 
current leases on such locations have terms ranging from to years with total remaining commitments per location ranging from million to million 
closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
many of the general risks and uncertainties the company faces could also have an adverse impact on its retail segment 
also  many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control  that could adversely affect the retail segment s future results  cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected  and or have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the retail segment include  among other things  macro economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity  inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation  failure to attract new users to the macintosh platform  inability to sell third party hardware and software products at adequate margins  failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners  lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the us  costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of apple branded and third party retail inventory  and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost 
investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company s ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated 
the company has and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the company s strategic direction and product roadmap 
such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including distraction of management s attention away from normal business operations  insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy  and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence process 
because these new ventures are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
declines in the sales of the company s professional products  software  accessories  or service and support contracts  or increases in sales of consumer products  including ipods  may negatively impact the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages 
the company s professional products  including power macintosh and powerbook systems  software  accessories  and service and support contracts  generally have higher gross margins than the company s consumer products  including imacs  ibooks  ipods  and content from the itunes music store 
a shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the company s future gross margin and operating margin percentages 
the company s traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products  specifically the imac g and ibook  instead of professional products 
professional users may choose to buy the imac g due to its relative price performance  use of the same powerpc g processor used in the company s power macs  and unique design featuring a flat panel screen 
potential powerbook customers may also choose to purchase ibooks instead due to their price performance and screen size 
additionally  significant future growth in ipod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages 
it is likely that some of the company s current and potential professional  creative  and small business customers  who are most likely to utilize professional systems  believe that the relatively slower mhz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the company utilizes in its macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance 
these factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the company s professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages 
the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 
the company s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels 
the company s direct sales  primarily through its retail and online stores  generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales 
additionally  the company s direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products  which generally have higher gross margins  than its indirect channels 
as a result  the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product  geographic  or channel mix  or new product announcements  including the transition to intel based macintosh computers 
in addition  the company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months  a pattern typical in the personal computer industry 
this sales pattern can produce pressure on the company s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the company s ability to predict its financial results accurately 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products  an internal systems failure  or failure of one of the company s key logistics  components suppliers  or manufacturing partners  can have significant adverse impacts on the company and its results of operations and financial condition 
the company has higher research and development and selling  general and administrative costs  as a percentage of revenue  than many of its competitors 
the company s ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace 
as a result  the company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems 
many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures 
further  as a result of the expansion of the company s retail segment and costs associated with marketing the company s brand including its unique operating system  the company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors 
if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins  its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure 
the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long term supply agreements 
this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
the company distributes its products through third party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers 
a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
the company also has unsecured non trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company 
in addition  the company has entered into long term supply agreements to secure supply of nand flash memory and intends to prepay a total of billion under these agreements 
while the company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments  there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses 
additionally  if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate  it becomes more likely that the company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors 
the company s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 
much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including its chief executive officer  members of its executive team  and those in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley  where the majority of the company s key employees are located 
the company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent 
recent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the company s future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 
the company is subject to risks associated with the selection  availability  and cost of insurance 
the company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance 
such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs  higher policy deductibles  lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions 
for some risks  because of cost and or availability  the company does not have insurance coverage 
because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks  and in some cases self insures completely  unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the company relies could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the company s ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders  impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information 
management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures 
however  there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the company or a third party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations 
a large portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased 
the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  australia  canada  and certain parts of asia and non dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world 
weaknesses in foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen and the euro  can adversely impact consumer demand for the company s products and the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales 
conversely  a strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can cause the company to modify international pricing and affect the value of the company s foreign denominated sales  and in some cases  may also increase the cost to the company of some product components 
margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries  and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers  can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations  including tariffs and antidumping penalties 
derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
further information related to the company s global market risks may be found in part ii  item a of this form k under the subheading foreign currency risk and may be found in part ii  item of this form k at notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including  in some instances  the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life  and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates  including various european union member countries  japan  and certain states within the us in the future  these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in accounting rules could affect the company s future operating results 
financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies  including the fasb and the sec  who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards 
a change from current accounting standards could have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for share based payments  sfas no 
r 
in april  the sec deferred the effective date of sfas no 
r to years beginning after june  therefore  sfas no 
r will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal the company expects the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately for the first quarter of fiscal although the effect from the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock based compensation expense 
changes in the company s tax rates could affect its future results 
the company s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
in addition  the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse affect on the company s net income and financial condition 
the company s stock price may be volatile 
the company s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and its competitors 
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  including lack of positive general economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s stock in the future 
in addition  increases in the company s stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures  there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s operating results and financial position 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s short term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital  meet liquidity requirements  and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment 
the company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio 
the external managers adhere to the company s investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents  highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments 
as of september   approximately million of the company s short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from to years 
as of september   million of the company s investment portfolio classified as short term investments had maturities ranging from to years 
the remainder all had underlying maturities between and months 
the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities  due to liquidity needs  in anticipation of credit deterioration  or for duration management 
the company recognized a net loss before taxes of  in  and net gains before taxes of million and million in  and  respectively as a result of such sales 
in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million decline in fair value 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
except in instances noted above  the company s policy is to hold investments to maturity 
from time to time  the company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the company s floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its debt  and or to diversify a portion of the company s exposure away from fluctuations in short term us interest rates 
the company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during or and had no open interest rate derivatives at september  foreign currency risk in general  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures 
however  the company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate random market price paths 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
