page 
table of contents contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake  our contracts generally fall into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price  and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table presents the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september in millions cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract  it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones  or performance factors defined in the contract 
in general  we prefer cost reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum bid contracts 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project 
under lump sum bid contracts  we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks that are reduced by the negotiation process  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received  problems with new technologies  and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of our fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turn key construction 
page 
table of contents guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then we will bear at least some  if not all  of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
competition we engage in a highly competitive business 
some of our competitors are larger than us or are subsidiaries of larger companies  and therefore may possess greater resources than we do 
furthermore  because the technical professional aspects of our business do not usually require large amounts of capital  there is relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications 
accordingly  we compete with regional  national  and international firms 
within any specific geographic area  certain competitors  including regional competitors  may possess greater resources than we do 
the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate 
our largest competitors for engineering  construction  and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel group  inc  fluor corporation  foster wheeler corp  washington group international  kellogg brown root  aker kvaerner  technip  and amec plc 
in the area of buildings  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr  inc  hellmuth  obata kassabaum  aecom technology  turner construction  and day zimmermann 
in the area of infrastructure  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff  urs corporation  hntb  and ws atkins 
in the area of ws federal programs  our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the shaw group  saic  chm hill  weston solutions  lockheed martin corporation  tetra tech  and computer sciences corporation 
and in the area of pulp and paper  our principal competitors include be k  and amec plc 
employees at september   we had approximately  full time  staff employees including contract staff 
additionally  as of september   there were approximately  persons employed in the field on a project basis 
the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

we also rent a portion of our construction equipment on a short term basis 
item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees  litigation and investigations 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  environmental exposure  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
in addition  as a contractor providing services to agencies of the united states government  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations and claims by  or on behalf of  the government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations  and procurement practices 
management believes  after consultation with counsel  that such guarantees  litigation  united states government contract related audits  investigations and claims should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the matters described above  we are involved in a dispute with a client relating to a large waste incineration project in europe 
the contract was entered into by one of our subsidiaries several years ago  prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary 
the dispute involves proper waste feed  content of residues  final acceptance of the plant  and costs of operation and maintenance of the plant 
we have initiated litigation against the client and are seeking in excess of million approximately million in damages 
the client has filed a counterclaim against us  which we believe is without merit 
we believe our claims are valid and enforceable and that we will be ultimately successful in obtaining a favorable judgment

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this management s discussion and analysis md a is to provide an overview of the company s financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 
in this discussion  we may make statements that are not based on historical fact 
all such statements are expressly forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of although such statements are based on management s current estimates and expectations  and currently available competitive  financial  and economic data  forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
we therefore caution the reader that there are a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forward looking statements 
a list of some of the factors most likely to occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward looking statements is presented at the end of this md a 
in this md a  we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows apb accounting principles board babtie group the babtie group limited is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients operating in the infrastructure  facilities  environmental  defense  and outsourcing markets  among other 
the babtie group employs approximately  people in offices located throughout primarily the united kingdom and asia  and was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal backlog backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us 
our policy with respect to o m contracts  however  is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year  regardless of the remaining life of the contract 
for federal programs other than federal o m contracts  our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award  whether funded or unfunded  and exclude option periods 
operating profit from the consolidated statements of earnings  operating profit means revenues  less direct costs of contracts and sg a expenses 
sfas statement of financial accounting standards  an accounting standard adopted by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
sg a expenses from the consolidated statements of earnings  sg a expenses means selling  general and administrative expenses 
overview net earnings in fiscal increased by as compared to last year  and eps diluted grew by 
we saw increased revenues from clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve  but in particular  oil gas and refining  and infrastructure 
contributing to the increase in revenues were the effects of including the results of operations of the babtie group for all page 
table of contents of fiscal  and a increase in pass through costs 
when we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs 
since pass through costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not have significant margins  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 
our cash balances more than doubled during fiscal cash and cash equivalents increased from million at september  to million at september  our net cash defined as cash and cash equivalents less bank debt increased from million at september  to million at september  additions to property and equipment used million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal as compared to million last year 
our cash balances  combined with a borrowing capacity of million under our long term  unsecured revolving credit facility  provide sufficient capital resources for us to fund our on going operations 
critical accounting policies in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results  a reader of this md a should endeavor to understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business entity performing long term engineering and construction type contracts requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
although our significant accounting polices are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures in accounting for long term engineering and construction type contracts  we follow the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  we recognize revenues at the time we provide services 
depending on the commercial terms of the contract  we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred  or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion 
this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule  the cost of materials and labor  and productivity  and the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  and achievement of contractual performance standards 
many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
in certain instances  we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates  target costs  and or other performance criteria 
failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 
one such contract is with the us department of energy for the fernald closure project 
this contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost 
in addition  the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the doe until the completion of the project  currently estimated to occur in at september  we had recognized million of deferred fees relating to this contract completion 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
page 
table of contents the nature of our business results in clients  subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract  we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore  the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate  based on all relevant facts and circumstances available  of the additional costs to be incurred 
in those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible  we may present a claim to the client for such costs 
in such situations  we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred  without profit  to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue  and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 
certain cost reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment 
in this situation  revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts 
in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract  we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 
as is common in the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures 
for certain of these joint ventures ie  where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture  we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues  costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings 
for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures  we use the equity method of accounting 
accounting for stock issued to employees we account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method  in accordance with apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  on the date a stock option is granted to an employee  we measure compensation cost based on the excess  if any  of the market price of the company s common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option 
in accordance with current accounting standards  we compute a pro forma expense amount for stock options issued  and we disclose this pro forma expense amount in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the pro forma expense amount 
the black scholes model  however  was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable 
in addition  the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical  fair value of an option 
changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option 
accordingly  we caution the readers of our consolidated financial statements that the results of applying the black scholes model are not necessarily a reliable measure of the true fair value of stock options granted to employees 
in december  the fasb adopted sfas no 
r accounting for share based payment 
sfas r supersedes apb and requires companies to record an expense in their financial statements for stock based awards using valuation methods like black scholes 
sfas r will be effective for the company beginning with the first quarter of fiscal although we presently intend to adopt sfas r retrospectively  there are several reasons why the expense we expect to record in the future relating to share based compensation may differ from the amounts we ve disclosed in our prior pro forma disclosures 
first  we have modified certain provisions of our broad based employee page 
table of contents stock purchase plans to substantially eliminate the amount of expense that would otherwise be recorded under sfas r 
second  the amount of stock options we will grant in the future is likely to be different from the level of awards that were made in the past 
and third  the value assigned to the stock options we award in the future will be dependent on the assumptions used to value them 
to the extent these assumptions change  the amount of expense we ll recognize in the future will most likely vary from amounts recognized in the past 
accounting for pension plans in accounting for pension plans  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
sfas requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost  and the value of the plans assets and liabilities 
these assumptions involve discount rates  investment returns  and projected salary increases  among others 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans  and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used 
the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal ranged from to  unchanged from last year 
we believe this range of rates reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets  considering projected rates of inflation  the diversification of the plans assets  and the expected real rates of market returns 
the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were lowered from a range of to in fiscal to a range of to in fiscal changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities  and the associated pension expense 
management  together with our actuaries  monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 
in connection with the fiscal acquisition of certain engineering and contracting businesses from stork nv  we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a multiemployer pension plan into a new  single employer pension plan we formed during fiscal for the benefit of our employees in the netherlands 
if such a transfer were to occur presently  we believe the value of the assets we would receive would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume 
included in other deferred liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september  is approximately million for the prior service obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the netherlands 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
our effective tax rate increased from during each of fiscal and fiscal to during fiscal we routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 
insurance matters  litigation  claims  and contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the company as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  environmental exposure  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under our insurance programs 
page 
table of contents this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
in addition  as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations  and claims by  or on behalf of  the us federal government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations  and procurement practices 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims  guarantees  litigation  and audits and investigations 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurance related claims that are known and have been asserted against us  and for insurance related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis  but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates 
we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 
testing goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment 
in conducting the impairment test  we may apply  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party 
since the adoption of sfas in fiscal  we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill 
foreign currencies in general  our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies 
in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
results of operations general our business focuses exclusively on providing technical  professional  and construction services to a large number of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients around the world 
the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering  design  architectural  and similar services  construction services which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities  operations and maintenance o m services which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large  complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities  and process  scientific  and systems consulting services which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients 
page 
table of contents the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete  single responsibility  design build operate contracts 
the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september in thousands project services construction operations and maintenance process  scientific and systems consulting certain amounts for fiscal have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal and fiscal presentation 
we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets 
we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources 
the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september in thousands oil gas and refining federal programs chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings technology and manufacturing pulp and paper other other includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products  and basic resources such as mining  minerals  and fertilizers 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased by billion  or  to billion  compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve  lead by a increase in revenues from clients operating in the oil gas and refining industries  and a increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market 
the increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil gas and refining industries was due primarily to continuing projects we re executing in the area of clean fuels  combined with new awards of projects assisting refiners improve and enhance capacity 
also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the upstream area of this market relating to oil sands extraction projects 
the increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market was due primarily to the page 
table of contents inclusion of the babtie group for all of fiscal the babtie group contributed approximately million of revenue during fiscal  compared to approximately million last year the babtie group was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
also contributing to the increase in revenues was a million increase in pass through costs 
when we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs 
the level of pass through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and o m projects 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding pass through costs 
as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 
the increase in direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenues was due to the increase in pass through costs  off set in part by the inclusion of the babtie group for all of fiscal whose revenues are weighted towards project services 
since pass through costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not generate significant margins  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 
sg a expenses during fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal contributing to the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal was the inclusion of the babtie group for the entire year 
the babtie group contributed approximately million of sg a expenses during fiscal  versus approximately million of sg a expenses last year 
the balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation  and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities 
operating profit fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal the increase in operating profit during fiscal as compared to last year was due to the overall increase in business activity 
as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for fiscal and in spite of the significant increase in pass through costs  the company was able to maintain its level of operating profit by limiting the increase in sg a expenses 
interest income increased by million to million during fiscal  compared to million of interest income during fiscal the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal as compared to last year 
interest expense increased by million to million during fiscal  compared to million of interest expense during fiscal the increase in interest expense reflects the effects of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group being outstanding for all of fiscal  versus only a portion of fiscal we recorded income tax expense of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal our overall effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our page 
table of contents estimates 
the increase in our overall tax rate during fiscal as compared to last year was due primarily the effects of the non deductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of certain intangible assets we acquired in connection with the babtie group  combined with a shift in earnings among our non us operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal total revenues for fiscal remained relatively unchanged from fiscal at billion 
the amount of pass through costs included in revenues in fiscal declined by approximately million  or  as compared to fiscal off setting this decline in field services activity in part was approximately million of revenues of the babtie group  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal compared to for fiscal in general  the percentage improvement in this performance indicator from fiscal to was due primarily to a higher portion of our total revenues being derived from technical professional services versus field services 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal included in sg a expenses for fiscal is approximately million of sg a expenses from the babtie group 
the balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation  and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities 
operating profit for fiscal totaled million  relatively unchanged from the fiscal amount of million 
as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for both fiscal and interest income increased by million to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was due primarily to slightly higher borrowings under our long term  revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september  in thousands payments due by fiscal period total less than year years years more than years bank debt operating leases obligations under defined benefit pension plans a obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans b purchase obligations c total page 
table of contents a assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal  allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases  but limited to the amount recorded as of september  actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including amounts required by local laws and regulations  and other funding requirements 
b assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal  allowing for certain growth 
due to the nonqualified nature of the plans  and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service  the payments included in the schedule was limited to the amount recorded as of september  c represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of september  backlog the following table summarizes our total backlog at september    and in millions technical professional services total because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time  and many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years  we evaluate our backlog on a year over year basis  rather than on a sequential  quarter over quarter basis 
our backlog at september  increased by billion  or  to billion from billion at september  the increase in backlog during fiscal was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating within the oil gas  federal programs  and the civil and infrastructure industry groups and markets 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client 
however  we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts 
in a situation where a client terminates a contract  we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and  in certain instances  we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 
while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog  our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 
total backlog at september  included approximately billion  or of total backlog  relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies 
this compares to approximately billion  or of total backlog  and billion  or of total backlog  of us federal backlog at september  and  respectively 
most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year 
in general  these contracts must be funded annually ie  the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency  and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 
we estimate that approximately billion  or of total backlog at september  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 
page 
table of contents effects of inflation during fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were earned under cost reimbursable type contracts 
because a significant portion of our revenues is earned from such contracts  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low 
however  as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future 
to the extent permitted by competition  we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts with fixed price and lump sum terms  we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates 
on these projects  we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of our business  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations 
at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and million of available capacity under our million unsecured  revolving credit facility discussed below 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million  to million 
this compares to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million during fiscal  and to a net increase of million during fiscal during fiscal  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of million and million  respectively 
these inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of million and million  respectively 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in net earnings and a million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts 
also contributing to the increase in cash flows from operations were a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense a non cash expense  an million decrease in gains attributable to the sale of assets a common reclassification within the consolidated statements of cash flows so that the cash flows from the sales of assets may be shown in the investing section of the statements  and the effects of a million change in the deferred income tax accounts 
we used million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal for investing activities 
this compares to net cash outflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
in comparing our investing activities during fiscal to last year  the largest single variance related to cash used for acquisitions of businesses  we used million of cash and cash equivalents for acquisitions last year  and zero during fiscal this reduction in cash outflows was partially off set by a million increase in miscellaneous  non current assets relating primarily to increases in prepaid pension assets  and a million increase in additions to property  plant and equipment 
our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million during fiscal  and net cash outflows of million during fiscal the million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million decrease in borrowings  net of page 
table of contents repayments  under our long term credit facilities  combined with a net million increase during fiscal in short term borrowings 
the higher borrowing activity during fiscal was due primarily to the acquisition of the babtie group 
also contributing to the improvement in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal as compared to last year was a million increase in proceeds from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans 
we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at september   compared to million at september  our consolidated working capital position at september  was million  compared to million at september  we have a long term  unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to million of debt capacity  under which only million was utilized at september  in the form of direct borrowings 
we believe that the capacity  terms and conditions of our long term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 
we also had  at september   million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed  short term credit facilities 
under our stock repurchase program  we are authorized by our board of directors to buy back up to million shares of the common stock of the company in the open market 
repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances 
from inception of the program through september   we have repurchased a total of  shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of million 
no shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal and substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans

r accounting for share based payment was issued 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires companies to record compensation expense for stock based awards using a fair value method and is effective for annual periods beginning after june  effective in fiscal for the company 
compensation expense will be recorded over the requisite service period  which is typically the vesting period of the award 
we currently plan to adopt sfas r effective october   using the modified retrospective application method  and have begun the process of collecting and analyzing the information required 
we estimate that the adoption of sfas r will have an after tax impact of approximately million in fiscal factors that may affect forward looking statements as mentioned above  there are a variety of factors that could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this md a  including  in no particular order  the following increase in competition by united states and international competitors  changes in global business  economic  political  and social condition  availability of qualified engineers  architects  designers and other home office staff needed to execute contracts  availability of qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located  page

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our only source for long term credit is a million syndicated revolving credit facility 
the total amount outstanding under this facility at september  was million 
this agreement expires in january  and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations 
foreign currency risk in general  our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
page 
table of contents we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because  in general  our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies 
in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
concurrent with the acquisition of the babtie group  we entered into a forward contract with a large  us bank in the notional amount of million approximately million 
the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company s exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries 
based on the terms of the contract  we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september  should be limited to million of expense 
in addition  we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement with another us bank which fixes the effective rate of interest on million then  approximately million of bank debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group 
this instrument allows us to receive a floating rate payment tied to the month libor plus a spread from the counterparty  in exchange for a fixed rate payment from us 
both of the aforementioned contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions sfas no
