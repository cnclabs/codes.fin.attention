during times of economic slow down  the healthcare industry continues to remain strong with annual cost increases of between for medical devices 
these trends establish a clear mapping for the future of the new  innovative and clinically proven medical devices such as we provide

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the company s estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranty reserves and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sales of products is recognized when products are shipped to customers provided that title has passed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the company accounts for shipping and handling fees passed on to customers as sales 
the corresponding costs are recorded as cost of sales 
revenue from multi year contracts is considered deferred revenue and is recognized as revenue when product is shipped 
inventory valuation 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market on the first in  first out fifo method of actual cost or the current estimated market value 
it regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage for the prior twelve month period and future sales forecasts 
although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact of the value of its inventory and its reported operating results 
warranty reserves 
the company s warranties require it to repair or replace defective products returned to it during the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
it records an estimate for warranty related costs based on actual historical return rates  anticipated return rates  and repair costs at the time of sale 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair products  could have a material adverse impact on future operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize and thereafter 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on the company s estimates of taxable income and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  it may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce its current valuation allowance which could materially impact its tax provision
