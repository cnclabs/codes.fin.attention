item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  we undertook a significant change in our strategic plan and related business operations by exiting the chewing gum business and refocusing entirely on the development  production and sale of over the counter pharmaceutical products 
in july  we sold substantially all of our assets and business related to our chewing gum operations to wrigley 
in december  we acquired the remaining interest of gel tech  making it a wholly owned subsidiary of matrixx 
in july  the name gel tech  llc was changed to zicam  llc 
our financial results reflect our former chewing gum operations as discontinued operations  and consequently these operations are not reflected in the following discussion and analysis 
we report zicam  llc s financial results on a consolidated basis 
our restructuring process continued in as we reincorporated in delaware  changed our name to matrixx initiatives  inc and consolidated our operations in our phoenix office 
moreover  as part of our focus on over the counter pharmaceutical products  we introduced five new zicam nasal gel products in  improved package graphics for the entire zicam product line and engaged a new sales team to represent our products to retailers 
we continued to expand the zicam product line in by introducing three zicam cold remedy oral products chewables  rapidmelts and oral mist 
furthering our growth  we introduced six zicam cough mist products in the third quarter of executive summary the company currently markets products within the billion overall cough and cold category at retail 
the products we market are seasonal in nature  and sales at retail generally increase as the level of population 
table of contents suffering from colds rises 
the company records sales when we ship products from our warehouse facilities 
during the third quarter the company usually realizes increased sales volume as retailers stock our products and order displays to prepare for the upcoming cough and cold season 
additional sales re orders to retailers are highly dependent upon the incidence of illness within the population 
retail consumption of our products is highest during the cough and cold season  which usually runs from september through april 
the company begins extensive advertising campaigns to coincide with the cough and cold season and generally realizes higher advertising expense in the fourth and first quarters of each year 
the second quarter of each year generally accounts for less than of annual sales 
our products are currently available at all of the major food  drug  and mass merchant retailers 
net sales for increased to approximately million  or above net sales in of million 
approximately of the increase was attributable to the six new zicam cough mist products that we began shipping in july additionally  approximately of the increased sales were due to increased sales of zicam cold remedy products and approximately of the increase was attributable to higher sales of our allergy and sinus products 
we expect the trend of increasing net sales will continue as we improve consumer awareness of our products  increase distribution of our products  and introduce new products 
the company expects annual net sales will increase over the million recorded in net income for was approximately million  an increase of approximately million over net income in of approximately million 
we expect net income in future periods will be significantly affected by the level of sales  the timing and amount of our advertising and research and development expenses  and the timing and amount of expenses incurred in the defense of product liability and securities litigation matters 
expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different in than the amounts incurred in the same periods in earlier years 
we expect that advertising expenses will be highest in the fourth and first quarters in conjunction with the cough and cold season 
the company expects annual net income in will grow above the level realized in we anticipate quarterly earnings will continue to vary along with the seasonality of sales 
we believe the second quarter of may result in a significant loss due to increased marketing support for the new nasal comfort brand  increased research and development expense  and continued high levels of legal expense 
since the introduction of our new zicam cough mist products  we now market zicam products in the cold nasal delivery products and oral delivery products  allergy sinus nasal delivery products  and cough oral delivery products market groups of the overall cough and cold category 
we expect that our mix of products sold will change due to seasonality and varying growth rates within the market groups 
for the year ended december  our mix of products sold units was cold nasal and oral  allergy sinus  and cough  compared to cold and allergy sinus for the year ending december  in february  the company announced nasal comfort  a new brand and product for nasal health 
the initial offering under the new brand is a unique product designed to help maintain the critical functions of the nasal cavity and its role in the respiratory process 
nasal comfort is a preservative free  sterile  hyper tonic aqueous solution with essential salts and oils that cleanses and moisturizes the nose 
the new product will be packaged in a pharmaceutical grade dispenser  employing a patented one way  micro filtration pump 
the company anticipates initial sales and shipments will begin in the second quarter of the company s management reviews several key performance indicators 
first  we compare our annual sales and net income performance against our goals for growth  which for  we stated as annual growth for each 
we exceeded both goals in second  we monitor our share of the cough and cold market 
for the weeks ended december   retail sales of our products as measured by three outlet syndicated scanner data  not including our customer wal mart increased approximately over the comparable period in the previous year  while the entire cough and cold category declined approximately over the same period 
the increased sales of our products achieved a share of approximately of the entire cough and cold market compared to a share of in the previous year 
third  we measure our ability to maintain strong gross margins on our products 
during  we achieved an average gross margin of  which is slightly below our goal of  due to the mix of products sold gross margin on our current products varies between and 
fourth  we evaluate our operating performance by reviewing  over time  our ability to decrease administrative and general costs as a percentage of net sales 
for fiscal  our operating expenses were approximately of our net sales compared to for fiscal operating expenses have been negatively impacted by an increase in legal expense million in  compared to million in primarily related to the product liability lawsuits which have been filed against the company see part ii  item legal proceedings 
finally  we review the distribution of our products by key national retailers 
in  our ten largest retail customers carried  on average  of our zicam products compared to seven of our ten products in those customers accounted for approximately of net 
table of contents sales in and of net sales in we expect to expand the distribution of our existing products among these retailers during the next year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  accounting for returns and allowances associated with our products  accounting for sales discounts and promotional programs  and accounting for legal contingencies 
intangible assets and goodwill we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the zicam  llc interest that we acquired from zensano  inc in december under sfas no 
 goodwill must be tested when a triggering event occurs or at least annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss 
factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share  a general decline in zicam product sales  higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters 
any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of zicam  llc  or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting zicam  llc  could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our annual evaluation of goodwill was completed in the third quarter of and no impairment was identified 
income taxes due to our significant operating losses prior to  we possess a sizeable tax loss carry forward which can be used to reduce our taxable income in future periods 
due to our history of operating losses  we recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in and prior years to offset the entire deferred tax asset arising from our tax loss carry forward 
however  due to the significant improvement in our net income in  together with our expectation of continuing profitability in future years  we determined that we are more likely than not to realize the tax benefit associated with our tax loss carry forward 
consequently  we reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a large portion of the deferred tax asset in the effect of this change was a decrease in our income tax expense of approximately million in in and  we recorded income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for the year and will continue to do so in future periods 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate the deferred tax valuation allowance regularly and adjust the amount to reflect our expectation of our ability to realize the tax benefit arising from our tax loss carry forward and other deferred tax items on a quarterly basis 
should there be a significant change in our expectations of future income or the ability to realize the deferred tax asset  the impact of increasing the deferred tax valuation allowance could be significant which would negatively impact our earnings 
customer returns and allowances we recognize revenues on the sale of our products when they are shipped from our warehouse facilities  and at that time record a provision for estimated product returns 
the estimate for product returns is based on our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects potential product returns 
to date  our sales returns experience has been consistent with our estimate for returns  except for returns of outdated products arising from excess production during the introduction of zicam cold remedy in the cough and cold season  which resulted in out of date product two years later 
in july  we reviewed the return provision for the three oral delivery cold remedy products that were introduced in the third quarter of based on our product return experience we reduced the return provision from to on sales of these three products in mid currently  we are recording a provision of of gross sales for the ten zicam products introduced in or earlier for potential returns and allowances 
in establishing the appropriate reserve level for the six new zicam cough mist products  that began shipping in july  we reviewed the similarities and differences of the six products relative to the ten zicam products for which we have longer product return experience 
based on that review  we believe that our past experiences with other products is a good indicator of the estimate of returns to be expected from the new products and are recording a provision of of 
table of contents gross sales for these products 
we will review the return provision at least quarterly and adjust these reserve amounts as actual product return experience continues to develop 
should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates  our operating and financial results would be materially affected 
in addition  we expect that a higher sales returns allowance will be recorded for any other new products that we introduce until such products achieve market acceptance 
legal contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business 
we are being sued by over individuals in approximately different lawsuits generally alleging that our zicam cold remedy nasal products caused damage to their sense of smell and or taste 
two of these lawsuits have been filed as class action lawsuits  although one has been dismissed 
various defendants in the lawsuits  including manufacturers and retailers  have sought indemnification or other recovery from us for damages related to the lawsuits 
in addition  two class action lawsuits which have been consolidated have been filed against matrixx  our president and chief executive officer  carl j 
johnson  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  william j 
hemelt  and our vice president of research and development  timothy l 
clarot  alleging violation of federal securities laws see part ii  item legal proceedings 
while we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in each of these proceedings  the outcome of these and any other proceedings that may arise cannot be predicted with certainty 
therefore  loss provisions arising from such matters will be recorded when a loss outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated  to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise 
at present  we have not been able to determine the probability of a loss outcome in any of the litigation to which we are currently subject 
accordingly  we have not recorded any loss provisions related to such litigation 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research development income from operations interest and other income interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales net sales for increased to approximately million  or above net sales in approximately of the million increase in net sales was attributable to sales of the six new zicam cough mist products introduced in the third quarter of  approximately of the increase was due to increased sales of our zicam cold remedy products  particularly the oral products introduced in  and the remainder of the increase was due to increased sales of zicam allergy and sinus products 
we believe increased sales of our products is primarily due to greater brand awareness and marketing efforts 
cost of sales the cost of sales for increased approximately million or over the cost of sales in the increase is due to the higher number of units sold in the cost per unit sold in decreased approximately compared to the cost per unit sold in the lower cost per unit sold is due to lower costs across our entire product line  including the new swab product introduced in the first quarter of gross profit gross profit for increased to approximately million or above gross profit in  primarily due to the increase in sales 
the gross margin achieved in remained unchanged from the prior year s gross 
table of contents margin of 
the gross margin on our current products varies between and 
gross margin will continue to be affected by the relative mix of products sold 
operating expenses operating expense for increased to approximately million from million in the increase is primarily due to a million increase in legal expense associated with product liability and securities litigation claims 
total legal expense in was approximately million compared to million in also contributing to the higher expenses were increases in advertising expense of million approximately million in compared to million in  non advertising marketing expense of million primarily related to consumer research as well as public relations expense associated with the anosmia claims  higher insurance expense of million  higher sales commission expense of million  higher labor expense of approximately million  and increased quality control and customer service expense of million 
the company also recorded an increase in charitable contributions of million 
we expect expenses in future periods will vary largely in relation to the level of our advertising expenditures  which are heaviest in the first and fourth quarters 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur approximately million to million in higher legal expense each quarter as a result of the zicam cold remedy product liability and securities litigation matters in which we are engaged see part i  item legal proceedings 
the company continues to pursue an agreement with various of its insurers concerning recovery of defense costs relating to these matters 
research and development research and development expense decreased from approximately million in to million in we had previously announced our intention to spend of net sales annually on research and development efforts  however  due to research and development efforts being diverted as a result of product liability litigation matters  we did not spend at that level in we continue to maintain research and development efforts and remain focused on developing new products 
interest other income other income increased to almost million in  approximately million higher than the increase is attributable to royalty income associated with a gum product marketed by wrigley 
we do not anticipate any future royalty income under this agreement 
interest expense interest expense of  for was approximately  below the level incurred in the decrease was attributable to the repayment of the debt of million we incurred in connection with the acquisition of the interest in gel tech  llc in december this debt with imputed interest of was fully repaid in november in july  we borrowed million against our credit facility with comerica bank  which we repaid in the fourth quarter of we ended the year with no debt outstanding 
our credit facility included interest at above prime or at december  
income before income taxes income before income tax for increased to approximately million from million in the increase is due to higher gross profit resulting from higher sales  which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
we expect that net income in future periods will be significantly impacted by the success of our current products  new product introductions including new products we plan to introduce in  and year over year changes in our advertising  research and development  and legal expenses 
provision for income tax expense in  we recorded a provision for income tax expense at our combined federal and state estimated  effective tax rates 
due to operating income recorded in  we recognized income tax expense of approximately million 
net income net income increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in compared to net income for of approximately million 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research development income from operations interest and other income interest expense income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income net sales net sales for increased to approximately million  or above net sales in approximately one half of the million increase in net sales was attributable to increases in sales of zicam cold remedy nasal gel products  particularly the swab products  approximately of the increase was due to the three new zicam cold remedy oral products introduced in  and the remainder of the increase was due to increased sales of zicam extreme congestion relief 
sales of zicam cold remedy nasal swab products increased due to the greater distribution and availability of supply in and a severe cold season 
zicam extreme congestion relief sales increased due to greater retail distribution of the product in sales of all of the products increased due to greater brand awareness resulting from our increased marketing efforts 
we ended with a backlog in orders of million for our adult swab product 
in anticipation of year end demand  we built inventory of adult swab products starting in april  but it was not sufficient as demand for all of our products  including the swab products  spiked in december due to the severe cold season 
cost of sales the cost of sales for increased approximately million or over the increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales 
the higher per unit cost of the swab products  including the higher cost agreed to in our previously announced settlement with innovative swab technologies  the manufacturer of the old swab product  contributed to the increase in cost of sales 
gross profit gross profit for increased to approximately million  or above the level  due to the higher sales level 
offsetting the higher sales was the higher unit cost of sales  primarily due to the higher cost of the swab products  which is reflected in a decrease in gross profit percentage of sales to in from in operating expenses operating expenses increased from approximately million in to million in the increase is largely due to higher advertising expense million in compared to million in  higher sales commission expense of million related to the increase in sales  and higher labor costs of million 
research and development research and development expense amounted to million for compared to million for  reflecting costs associated with the three new zicam products that were introduced in  development cost of the new swab product  and research expense of product concepts that we expect to introduce in and beyond 
interest and other income net 
table of contents interest and other income for amounted to approximately  or approximately  less than the level 
approximately  of the decrease is due to a decline in royalty income associated with a gum product marketed by wrigley and  is due to a decrease in interest income from a lower invested cash balance 
interest expense interest expense decreased to approximately  for from approximately  in the decrease is entirely attributable to the repayment of the debt incurred with our acquisition of the interest in zicam  llc in december this debt was paid in full in november income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest our income before income taxes and minority interest in was approximately million  an increase of approximately million from the million reported for the increase is due to a higher gross profit resulting from higher net sales 
provision for income tax expense due to the income we recorded in and our expectation of net income in future periods  we concluded that  more likely than not  we will be able to utilize the accumulated tax loss carry forward that had been generated in prior years but not reflected as an asset 
based on this determination  we recorded a decrease in the provision for income taxes of almost million in the income tax expense in reflects a full provision for income tax expenses at our combined federal and state tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital increased to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of approximately million 
during  we experienced an increase in available cash of approximately million 
in addition  we restricted million of cash for a self structured product liability insurance program 
the overall increase in cash from operations was almost million 
the increase in cash from operations was driven by higher sales during the company generates cash from sales of zicam products to retailers and distributors 
the majority of sales are given day credit terms  however payment terms are occasionally extended  as retailers begin to increase inventory of our products prior to the onset of the cough and cold season 
the company recognizes an allowance for bad debt at the time of sale 
the bad debt allowance is reviewed on a monthly basis and we believe our allowance is sufficient to cover outstanding receivables 
the annual change in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses largely reflects the increase in the company s business and the number of new products 
on a quarterly basis  changes in these items reflect the seasonal nature of the company s business 
the company records the bulk of its sales  which is reflected in higher accounts receivable  in the third  fourth and first quarters  builds inventory during the second through fourth quarter periods  and advertises its products  which is the largest component of accrued expenses  in the fourth and first quarters 
although affected by the build up of inventory in the second through fourth quarters  accounts payable and accrued expenses are more significantly affected by advertising spending which largely occurs in the fourth and first quarters 
during  investing activities used approximately million of cash 
the use of cash was primarily due to million being restricted to secure a million letter of credit related to the new product liability insurance program  as discussed below 
the company also invested approximately  for capital purchases related to information systems  office improvements  and new laboratory equipment 
cash flow from financing activities provided approximately  from exercise of stock options 
we have very little capital expenditures since we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our products 
generally  to the extent our operations are profitable  our business is cash flow positive 
additionally  due to our sizeable tax loss carryforward  we are able to avoid sizeable income tax payments 
we expect that this ability to avoid large tax payments should continue through we do have working capital requirements arising from the increase of inventory and accounts receivable in excess of the increase in accounts payable  but these vary throughout the year reflecting the seasonal nature of our business 
in april  we established a fully funded deductible insurance program through a product liability insurance carrier 
under the program  we have agreed to reimburse our insurer for its claims administration expenses and for amounts paid out by it in settlement of product liability claims filed after the initial date of the 
table of contents program and which are not covered by insurance programs from prior years 
the terms of the program require us to maintain an irrevocable  evergreen letter of credit issued by a bank or other financial institution to secure our reimbursement obligations to our insurer 
we have a million letter of credit with comerica bank and have reserved an equal amount of cash to secure repayments of amounts that become due under the letter of credit 
the million reserve is noted as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet and has been placed in an interest bearing certificate of deposit 
we have a million credit facility with comerica bank which was renewed for a two year term in may the credit facility includes interest at above prime or at december  in july  we borrowed million under the facility to meet our working capital needs in the third quarter 
the borrowing was used to pay for the substantial inventory increase needed for sales during the peak cough and cold season 
we repaid the debt in the fourth quarter of and ended the year with no debt 
we are in compliance with the earnings and financial covenants contained in our credit agreement 
we believe that our existing capital resources and our credit line will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations we have entered into certain long term contractual obligations that will require various payments over future periods as follows contractual cash obligations in thousands of dollars payments due by period as of december  less than after total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

risk factors our new business focus means we have a limited operating history on which to assess our current and prospective performance 
table of contents although we have been in operations for a number of years  the significant change of direction and focus in our business that we made in by exiting the chewing gum business and refocusing entirely on the development  production and sale of over the counter pharmaceutical products presents a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our current and prospective performance 
the possibility of our future success must be considered relative to the problems  challenges  complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development and operation of a new business  and the development and marketing of relatively new products such as the zicam products 
if our zicam products do not gain widespread market acceptance or receive additional adverse publicity  our anticipated sales and results of operations will suffer although we believe that each of our products  and in particular our zicam cold remedy nasal products  offer unique benefits to consumers  we cannot be certain that any of these products will achieve widespread acceptance by the market 
in addition  given their recent introduction in late  our three new oral zicam products have not yet reached the level of market recognition achieved by the original zicam cold remedy nasal gel pump or swab products 
while we are working to increase the market presence of all of our products  including our new cough mist products  we cannot be certain that demand for these products will grow 
if problems arise concerning the efficacy or safety of any of our products  or if any of our products receives additional adverse publicity  or if any of our products fails to achieve widespread market acceptance for any other reason  our operating results and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
our results could also be affected by fluctuations in buying patterns and inventory levels of major customers 
unanticipated problems associated with product development and commercialization could adversely affect our operating results our successful development of existing and new products is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development and commercialization of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that we may experience unanticipated or otherwise negative research and development results  existing or proposed products may be found to be ineffective or unsafe  or may otherwise fail to receive required regulatory clearances or approvals  we may find that existing or proposed products  while effective  are uneconomical to commercialize or market  we may be unable to produce sufficient product inventories to meet customer demand  existing or proposed products do not achieve broad market acceptance  or proprietary rights held by third parties preclude us from developing or marketing existing or proposed products 
our inability to develop and commercialize our existing products or any new products  including our nasal comfort product  on a timely basis and within our financial budgets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and future prospects 
our inability to provide scientific proof for product claims may adversely affect our sales the marketing of our zicam products involves claims that these products assist in reducing the duration and severity of the common cold in the case of zicam cold remedy products and controlling allergy symptoms in the case of zicam allergy relief 
under food and drug administration fda and federal trade commission ftc rules  we are required to obtain scientific data to support any health claims we make concerning our products 
we have obtained scientific data for our product claims  however  we cannot be certain that the scientific data we have obtained in support of our claims will be deemed acceptable to the fda  ftc or other regulatory bodies 
if any regulatory body requests supporting information and we are unable to provide support that is acceptable  either the fda or ftc could force us to stop making the claims in question or restrict us from selling the affected products 
fda and other government regulation may restrict our ability to sell our products we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting our business 
our zicam products are subject to regulation by the fda  including regulations with respect to labeling of products  approval of ingredients in products  claims made regarding the products  and disclosure of product ingredients 
if we do not 
table of contents comply with these regulations or if these regulations change in the future  the fda could force us to stop selling the affected products or require us to incur substantial costs in adopting measures to maintain compliance with these regulations 
if the fda came to believe that any of our products caused harm to consumers  we could be required to stop selling that product or subject the product to a recall 
our advertising claims regarding our products are subject to the jurisdiction of the ftc as well as the fda 
in both cases we are required to obtain scientific data to support any advertising or labeling health claims we make concerning our products  although no pre clearance or filing is required to be made with either agency 
if we are unable to provide the required support for such claims  the ftc may stop us from making such claims or require us to stop selling the affected products 
we may fail to compete effectively  particularly against  larger more established pharmaceutical and health products companies  or low cost generic drug manufacturers  causing our business and operating results to suffer the consumer health products industry is highly competitive 
we compete with companies with sales in the united states that are engaged in the development of both traditional and innovative healthcare products 
many of these companies have much greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do 
as well  many of these companies have already achieved significant product acceptance and brand recognition with respect to products that compete directly with our zicam and new products 
our competitors may successfully develop and market superior or less expensive products which could render our zicam and other future products less valuable or unmarketable 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe the intellectual property of others  our financial condition and future prospects could be materially harmed we rely significantly on the protections afforded by patent and trademark registrations that we routinely seek from the us patent and trademark office uspto and from similar agencies in foreign countries 
we cannot be certain that any patent or trademark application that we file will be approved by the uspto or other foreign agencies 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any trademark  trade name or patent that we hold against claims from  or use by  competitors or other third parties 
no consistent policy has emerged from the uspto or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under biotechnology and similar patents 
our future success will depend on our ability to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights  as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
we may be required at times to take legal action to protect our proprietary rights and  despite our best efforts  we may be sued for infringing on the patent rights of others 
patent litigation is costly and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could adversely affect our financial condition 
if we do not prevail  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
we cannot be certain that any required license would be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain a license  our business might be materially adversely affected 
in addition to seeking patent protection  we rely upon a combination of non disclosure agreements  other contractual restrictions and trade secrecy laws to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or that our competitors will not independently develop technology or trade secrets that compete with our proprietary information 
we may incur significant costs resulting from product liability claims or securities litigation we are subject to significant liability should use or consumption of our products cause injury  illness or death 
presently  we are being sued by over individuals in approximately different product liability lawsuits two of which have been filed as class action lawsuits  although one of the class action suits has been dismissed relating to our zicam cold remedy product 
various defendants in the lawsuits  including manufacturers and retailers  have sought indemnification or other recovery from us for damages related to the lawsuits 
although we carry product liability insurance  we cannot be sure that our insurance will be adequate to protect us against product liability claims or that insurance coverage will continue to be available 
product liability claims  such as those described in the annual report on form k for our fiscal year and in our subsequent reports on form q  even if without merit or for which we have substantial coverage  could result in significant legal defense costs  thereby increasing our expenses and lowering our earnings 
such claims  whether or not proven to be valid  could have a material adverse effect on our product branding and goodwill  resulting in reduced market acceptance of our products 
in addition  any adverse decision in such litigation could require significant damages to be paid or result in adverse publicity  either of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
separately  the company and three of its officers are also subject to two class action lawsuits which have been consolidated alleging violations of securities laws 
any adverse decision in such litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we do not have manufacturing capabilities of our own we currently do not have the physical or human resources to independently manufacture our zicam products or any other products that we may develop 
we currently outsource all of our product manufacturing and packaging operations and intend to continue this outsourcing for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to enter into cost effective or otherwise suitable arrangements for manufacturing of our zicam products or any other products  or if our third party contractors fail to adequately perform their manufacturing operations as occurred with our old swab products  our sales and related financial results could be materially adversely affected 
if  in the future  we decide to establish our own manufacturing facilities  we will require substantial additional funds and significant additional personnel to undertake such operations 
we cannot be certain that such funding or a sufficient number of such qualified persons will be available for such an undertaking 
we may experience product backlogs at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million in backlog of swab orders 
this backlog continued into march of fiscal we have undertaken significant measures to remedy the manufacturing problems that led to this backlog  including replacing our swab manufacturer and redesigning our swab product to permit higher volume production 
we built a substantial inventory of swab products to reduce the likelihood of any backlog occurring in the cough and cold season 
we increased the inventory of our other products in preparation of anticipated sell in during the third quarter of  and we established inventory plans to support sales through the cough and cold season 
however  we cannot be certain that these measures will be sufficient to prevent future backlog of these products or that other product backlogs will not occur in the future 
any such future backlogs will potentially result in higher production costs  higher freight costs to expedite shipment of raw materials and finished goods  fines from certain retailers  cancelled orders and lost opportunity costs 
these in turn could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock that could have rights superior to our outstanding shares of common stock  and  if issued  could adversely impact the value of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors  in its sole discretion  to issue up to  shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock 
these shares may be issued by our board without further action by our shareholders  and may include any of the following rights among others as our board may determine  which rights may be superior to the rights of our outstanding common stock voting rights  including the right to vote as a class on particular matters  preferences as to dividends and liquidation rights  conversion rights  anti dilution protections  and redemption rights since our board of directors has the authority to determine  from time to time  the terms of our authorized preferred stock  there is no limit on the amount of common stock that could be issuable upon conversion of any future series of preferred stock that may be issued 
the rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the issuance of any series of preferred stock with voting or other rights superior to those of our common stock 
the issuance of any series of preferred stock could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock 
the price of our stock may continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock  which is quoted for trading on the nasdaq national market  has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
any or a combination of the following factors could cause the market value of our common stock to decline quickly operating results that differ from market expectations  negative or other unanticipated results of clinical trials or other testing  delays in product development  technological innovations or commercial product introductions by our competitors  changes in government regulations  developments concerning proprietary rights  including pending or threatened patent litigation  public concerns regarding the safety of any of our products  the outcome of litigation against the company  and general economic and stock market conditions 
since the spring of  the stock market has experienced  and it may continue to experience  significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of small capitalization companies  like matrixx 
often  the effect on the price of 
table of contents such securities is disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in addition  we believe our stock price may fluctuate as investors increase and cover short positions in the stock 
in our case  such fluctuations may adversely affect our stockholders ability to dispose of their shares of matrixx at a price equal to or above the price at which they purchased such shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to our variable rate revolving line of credit with comerica bank 
at no time during fiscal or the first six months of fiscal did we have any outstanding balance against this line of credit 
in july  we borrowed million against our credit facility with comerica bank 
the primary purpose for the borrowing was to provide additional liquidity as we built inventory for expected increases in sales during the second half of we generally extend payment terms for customers during the third quarter as customers purchase new products and build inventory for the upcoming cough and cold season 
we repaid the debt in the fourth quarter of and ended fiscal with no debt 
consequently  we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future 
as of december  and december   we did not participate in any market risk sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases of which there were none in fiscal or commodity price risk
