item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we pursue growth by seeking to increase the number of our carloads and our average rate per carload and by continuing our selective acquisition program of seeking railroads that we believe will provide operating efficiencies  strategic advantages and or profit improvement opportunities 
our operating costs include labor  equipment rents locomotives and railcars  purchased services contract labor and professional services  diesel fuel  casualties and insurance  materials and other expenses 
each of these costs is included in one of the following functional departments maintenance of way  maintenance of equipment  transportation  equipment rental  and selling  general administrative 
in addition  depreciation of our fixed assets and asset sale gains and losses are significant components of our operating income

potential claims against railamerica for violations of most of the representations and warranties are capped at aud million us million 
we believe the ultimate impact of the representations and warranties will not have a material impact on our future results of operations 
however  they could have a material impact on future cash flows 
during the year ended december   we recognized a pre tax gain of million  or million  net of income taxes as a result of this sale 
the million tax provision on the sale of freight australia includes a provision of million for the previously unremitted earnings of freight australia 
the proceeds from the sale of freight australia were used to repay senior debt and repurchase our senior subordinated notes 
freight australia s results of operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements

commodity mix our railroads operate independently with their own management  employees and customer base 
they are spread out geographically and carry a diverse mix of commodities 
for the year ended december   bridge traffic accounted for  coal accounted for  and lumber and forest products accounted for of our carloads in north america 
as a percentage of revenue  which is impacted by several factors including the length of the haul  lumber and forest products generated  chemicals generated and paper products generated of our north american freight revenue for the year ended december  bridge traffic  which neither originates nor terminates on our line  generally has a lower rate per carload and generated of our freight revenue during the year ended december  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the critical financial statement accounts that are subject to significant estimation are reserves for litigation  casualty and environmental matters  deferred income taxes and property  plant and equipment depreciation methods 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies  an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and are based upon 
table of contents an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
subsequent changes to those estimates are reflected in our statements of income in the period of the change 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax asset  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on earnings 
additionally  changes in our estimates regarding the statutory tax rates to be applied to the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially affect the effective tax rate 
property  plant and equipment comprised of our total assets as of december  these assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
we use the group method of depreciation under which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in our track assets 
upon normal sale or retirement of track assets  cost less net salvage value is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized 
expenditures that increase asset values or extend useful lives are capitalized 
repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to operating expense when the work is performed 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment 
this review is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations

cash flows provided by operations of million less capital expenditures of million resulted in a net outflow of million for the year ended december  compared to a net outflow of million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash outflow is primarily due to the million initial lease payment to csx  changes in working capital and the timing of capital projects in north america and australia 
due to the capital intensive nature of our business  we believe this is an important cash flow measure 
our long term business strategy includes the selective acquisition and disposition of transportation related businesses 
accordingly  we may require additional equity and or debt capital in order to consummate acquisitions or undertake major business development activities 
it is impossible to predict the amount of capital that may be required for such acquisitions or business development  and whether sufficient financing for such activities will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

the covenants limit our ability to  among other things incur more debt  redeem or repurchase our common stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  
table of contents make acquisitions or investments  use assets as security in other transactions  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  create liens on our assets  make certain payments or capital expenditures  and extend credit 
in addition  the amended and restated senior credit facility also contains financial covenants that require us to meet a number of financial ratios and tests 
our ability to meet these ratios and tests and to comply with other provisions of the amended and restated senior credit facility can be affected by events beyond our control 
failure to comply with the obligations in the amended and restated senior credit facility could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of the term loans and revolving loans or other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we were in compliance with each of these covenants as of december   and anticipate being in compliance with our covenants for the next twelve months 
our amended and restated senior credit facility allows us to invest in permitted acquisitions of up to million in any one transaction but not to exceed million over the seven year term of the amended and restated credit facility and requires us to be in compliance with our financial covenants on a pro forma basis taking into account the acquisition and any related financing for the prior four fiscal quarters 
although we have no current plans to make acquisitions that do not meet these criteria  if proposed acquisitions exceed these limits we would seek to obtain waivers from the lenders or their consent to amend the relevant provisions

we do not believe these restrictions are likely to affect our acquisition program

in october  the american jobs creation act of the jobs act was signed into law 
the jobs act created a temporary dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria are met 
such repatriations must occur in either an enterprise s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  which indicates that the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the jobs act and the timing of the enactment necessitate a practical exception to the sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
requirement to reflect in the period of enactment the effect of a new tax law 
accordingly  an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
fsp requires that the provisions of sfas no 
be applied as an enterprise decides on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of its unremitted foreign earnings 
based on preliminary identification of potential repatriation and reinvestment opportunities  we expect that adoption of the repatriation provision of the act will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently use derivatives to hedge against increases in fuel prices and interest rates 
we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging instrument 
this documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet  commitments or forecasted transactions 
when we enter into a derivative contract  and at least quarterly  we assess whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas no 
 is recognized in current period earnings 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity  and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings 
we monitor our hedging positions and credit ratings of our counterparties and do not anticipate losses due to counterparty non performance 
foreign currency 
our foreign currency risk arises from owning and operating railroads in canada 
as of december   we had not entered into any currency hedging transactions to manage this risk 
a decrease in the canadian dollar could negatively impact our reported revenue and earnings for the affected period 
during  the canadian dollar increased 
the increase in the canadian dollar led to an increase of million in reported revenue and million increase in reported operating income in  compared to interest rates 
our interest rate risk results from issuing variable rate debt obligations  as an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows

fuel costs represented of total revenues during the year ended december  due to the significance of fuel costs to our operations and the historical volatility of fuel prices  we maintain a program to hedge against fluctuations in the price of our diesel fuel purchases 
each one cent change in the price of fuel would result in approximately a million change in fuel expense on an annual basis 
the fuel hedging program includes the use of derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges
