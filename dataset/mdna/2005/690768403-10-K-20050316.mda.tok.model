total consideration for the acquisition was approximately billion  including the assumption of approximately million of debt  a portion of which was refinanced in connection with the acquisition 
bsn was the second largest glass container manufacturer in europe with manufacturing facilities in france  spain  germany and the netherlands 
the acquisition was financed with borrowings under the company s second amended and restated secured credit agreement see note 
in order to secure the european commission s approval  the company committed to divest the barcelona  spain  and corsico  italy glass plants 
the company completed the sale of these plants in january and received cash proceeds of approximately million 
the acquisition was part of the company s overall strategy to improve its presence in the european market in order to better serve the needs of its customers throughout the european region and to take advantage of synergies in purchasing and cost reductions 
this integration strategy should lead to significant improvement in earnings from the european operations by the end of certain actions contemplated by the integration strategy may require additional accruals that will increase goodwill or result in additional charges to operations 
as of december   the company has determined to reduce capacity in one of the acquired plants 
during the first half of  the company expects to conclude the evaluation of its acquired capacity 
the total purchase cost of approximately billion will be allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values 
such allocations will be based upon valuations which have not been finalized

discontinued operations on october   the company announced that it had completed the sale of its blow molded plastic container operations in north america  south america and europe  to graham packaging company 
cash proceeds of approximately billion were used to repay term loans under the company s bank credit facility  which was amended to permit the sale 
the sale agreement included a post closing purchase price adjustment based on changes in certain working capital components and certain other assets and liabilities of the business 
because the level of working capital declined during the several months prior to closing  primarily due to seasonal factors  the company expects that an amount will be payable to graham packaging under this price adjustment provision 
the process for determining the amount payable to graham packaging has not been completed  however  the company expects that it will not have a material effect upon results of operations or cash flows 
included in the sale were plastics manufacturing plants in the us  two in mexico  three in europe and two in south america  serving consumer products companies in the food  beverage  household  chemical and personal care industries 
the blow molded plastic container operations were part of the consumer products business unit of the plastics packaging segment 
as required by fas no 
 the company has presented the results of operations for the blow molded plastic container business in the consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and as a discontinued operation 
interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that was required to be repaid from the proceeds

the sale of the blow molded plastic business resulted in a substantial capital loss  primarily related to previous goodwill write downs that were not deductible when recorded 
the gain on the sale of discontinued operations of million includes a credit for income taxes of million  representing the tax benefit from offsetting a portion of the loss against otherwise taxable capital gains

these charges resulted from the company s comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs 
in each case  the company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review 
see critical accounting estimates for further information 
asbestos related cash payments for were million  a reduction of million  or  from during  the company disposed of approximately  claims 
certain dispositions in and prior years have included deferred amounts payable over periods ranging up to seven years 
deferred amounts payable at december  were approximately million compared with approximately million at december  the company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis 
as of december   the number of asbestos related claims pending against the company was approximately  up from approximately  pending claims at december  in the second quarter of  the company received approximately  new filings in advance of the effective date of the recently enacted mississippi tort reform law 
approximately of those filings are cases with exposure dates after the company s exit from the business for which the company takes the position that it has no liability 
the company anticipates a significant number of the mississippi cases will be dismissed without prejudice subject to the possibility of such cases being re filed in other jurisdictions 
a former business unit of the company produced a minor amount of specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from until  when the business was sold 
in line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over years ago  the company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the company s products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law

non operational items mark to market of hedge contracts the company uses commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid for natural gas and the potential volatility in cash flows from future market price movements 
the company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its future usage requirements 
the company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve to eighteen months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements through the next twelve to eighteen months 
as discussed further below  prior to december   the company accounted for the above futures contracts on the balance sheet at fair value 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that was designated as  and met the required criteria for  a cash flow hedge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
any material portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge that was deemed to be ineffective was recognized in current earnings 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the commodity futures contracts described above did not meet all of the documentation requirements to qualify for special hedge accounting treatment and began to recognize all changes in fair value of these contracts in current earnings

the company compared the estimated net realizable values to the book values of the asset and determined that an asset impairment existed 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million million after tax to write down the assets to realizable values 
certain of the plastics businesses in the asia pacific region operate in highly competitive markets leading to reduced profit margins 
in addition  the company s pet container business has lost a significant amount of business in the past few years 
the reduced business and overall excess capacity in the industry has caused a reduction in the overall value of the business 
during  the company completed the sale of a portion of this business and is continuing to evaluate prospective buyers for the remaining businesses 
the company does not expect to record any further material losses related to this business

the company s decision to sell its assets related to the production of plastic trigger sprayers and finger pumps was consistent with its objectives to improve liquidity and to focus on its core businesses 
write down of equity investment during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the value of its investment in a north american soda ash mining operation was impaired and not likely to recover 
increasing global competition and recent development of foreign sources of soda ash have created significant excess capacity in that industry 
the resulting competitive environment caused management of the soda ash mining operation to significantly lower its projections of earnings and cash flows 
following an evaluation of future estimated earnings and cash flows  the company determined that its carrying value should be written down to estimated fair value and recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter which substantially reduced the carrying value of this equity method investment 
capital resources and liquidity current and long term debt the company s total debt at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  the decrease in the total debt from to was primarily the result of increased cash provided by operating activities  as discussed further below  partially offset by higher capital spending as a result of the company s announced investment in a new glass container manufacturing plant in the us the debt was also affected by several large transactions during the year 
the june  acquisition of bsn glasspack discussed above increased debt by billion and the october  divestiture of the blow molded plastic container business discussed above reduced debt by billion 
in addition  on october  the company received million in cash proceeds from the sale of its equity interest in consol limited of south africa  which was used to further reduce outstanding term debt 
in  the company also incurred debt of million for finance fees and repurchase premiums related to the financing of the bsn acquisition  the refinancing of the bsn senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of the company s senior notes due on october   in connection with the sale of the company s blow molded plastic container operations  the company s subsidiary borrowers entered into the third amended and restated secured credit agreement the agreement 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay c and d term loans and a portion of the b term loan outstanding under the previous agreement 
at december   the third amended and restated secured credit agreement includes a million revolving credit facility and a million a term loan  each of which has a final maturity date of april  it also includes a million b term loan  and million c term loan  and a million c term loan  each of which has a final maturity date of april  the third amended and restated secured credit agreement eliminated the provisions related to the c term loan that was canceled on august  the third amended and restated secured credit agreement also permits the company  at its option  to refinance certain of its outstanding notes and debentures prior to their scheduled maturity 
at december   the company s subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of million available under the agreement 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the third amended and restated secured credit agreement at december  was 
including the effects of cross currency swap agreements related to borrowings under the third amended and restated secured credit agreement by the company s australian  european and canadian subsidiaries  as discussed in note  the weighted average interest rate was 
the third amended and restated secured credit agreement contains covenants and provisions that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments  pay dividends  create liens on assets  enter into contingent obligations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  change the business conducted  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities 
in addition  the third amended and restated secured credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  maximum leverage ratios and specified capital expenditure tests 
as part of the bsn acquisition  the company assumed the senior subordinated notes of bsn 
the senior subordinated notes were due august  and had a face amount of million at the acquisition date and were recorded at the acquisition date at a fair value of million 
the senior subordinated notes were due august  and had a face amount of million at the acquisition date and were recorded at the acquisition date at a fair value of million 
the majority of these notes were repurchased in the fourth quarter of as discussed below 
during december  a subsidiary of the company issued senior notes totaling million and senior notes totaling million 
the notes bear interest at  and are due december  both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
the indentures for both series of notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued  and senior secured notes and senior notes 
the issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately million in addition to borrowings under the agreement to purchase in a tender offer million of the million senior notes due  million of the million bsn notes due and million of the million bsn notes due as part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer  the company recorded in the fourth quarter of additional interest charges of million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees 
during may  a subsidiary of the company issued senior secured notes totaling million and senior notes totaling million 
the notes bear interest at and  respectively  and are due may  and may   respectively 
both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  the assets of substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the senior secured notes 
the indentures for the senior secured notes and the senior notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued and senior secured notes 
the issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately million to purchase in a tender offer million of the million senior notes due and repay borrowings under the previous credit agreement 
as part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer  the company recorded in the second quarter of additional interest charges of million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees and million  of which million was allocated to discontinued operations  for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the previous credit agreement 
the senior secured and senior notes that were issued during the past three years were part of the company s plan to improve financial flexibility by issuing long term fixed rate debt  as well as refinance existing fixed rate debt that was nearing maturity 
while this strategy extended the maturity of the company s debt  long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing compared to shorter term  variable rate debt 
the company does not intend to continue to refinance variable rate debt with new fixed rate issuances  but will continue to issue long term fixed rate debt in order to repay existing fixed rate debt that is nearing maturity 
cash flows for  cash provided by continuing operating activities was million compared with million for  an improvement of cash provided by the change in components of working capital for was million compared to a use of cash of million for inventories in north american glass container operations were lower than prior year as a result of tighter management of inventory levels as part of the company s overall focus on working capital improvement 
inventory levels in the australian and european glass container operations  excluding the bsn acquisition  were also lower  as compared to the prior year 
these lower inventories along with lower accounts receivable  excluding the bsn acquisition and changes in foreign currency rates  are part of the company s focus on working capital management to improve cash flow 
for the year ended december   the company paid million in cash interest  including note repurchase premiums  compared with million  including note repurchase premiums  for the increase in cash interest paid is primarily due to the additional interest related to the bsn acquisition 
the interest expense related to the divested blow molded plastic container business has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
this increase was partially offset by lower overall interest rates from the december repricing of the agreement and from interest savings resulting from the company s fixed to floating interest rate swap program  as discussed further below  which reduced interest expense by approximately million 
asbestos related payments for decreased million  or  to million  compared with million for the company expects that its total asbestos related payments in will be moderately lower than based on the company s expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the company s expected operating cash flow  the company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims  and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos  will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity on a short term or long term basis 
for  the company s capital spending for additions to property  plant and equipment continuing operations was million compared with million for the increase is principally related to capital spending at the acquired bsn facilities and the new glass container plant being built in windsor  colorado 
the company continues to focus on reducing capital spending and improving its return on invested capital by improving capital efficiency 
the company expects to reduce its capital spending on existing facilities during by limiting the number of expansion projects and only undertaking projects with relatively short payback periods 
for  the company received proceeds of  million from divestitures and other asset sales compared with million in included in were the following items dollars in millions sale of the blow molded plastics business  sale of the investment in consol glass restructuring in the italian specialty glass business sale of a portion of the australian plastics business sale of certain real property other asset sales total proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales  included in was approximately million from the divestiture of certain closures assets as discussed above 
the company paid million in finance fees in for the issuance of senior notes as well as the refinancing of the agreement 
during  the company also paid and expensed million of tender offer premiums 
for  the company paid million in finance fees related to the issuance of the senior secured and senior notes discussed above as well as the refinancing of the agreement 
during  the company also paid and expensed million of tender offer premiums 
for  the company paid million related to debt hedging activity compared to million in as discussed further below  the company s strategy is to use currency and interest rate swaps to convert us dollar borrowings by the company s international subsidiaries  principally in australia  into local currency borrowings 
the decrease from prior year is largely due to a significantly smaller decline in the us dollar against the foreign currencies during as well as lower amounts that were hedged during the year 
the company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the third amended and restated secured credit agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs  debt service and other obligations on a short term and long term basis 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following information summarizes the company s significant contractual cash obligations at december  dollars in millions 
payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years contractual cash obligations long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases contractual purchase obligation interest  pension benefit plan contributions postretirement benefit plan benefit payments total contractual cash obligations   amount of commitment expiration per period total less than one year years years more than years other commercial commitments standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments accounts receivable securitization program as part of the acquisition of bsn  the company acquired a trade accounts receivable securitization program through a bsn subsidiary  bsn glasspack services 
the program was entered into by bsn in order to provide lower interest costs on a portion of its financing 
in november  bsn created a securitization program for its trade receivables through a sub fund the fund created in accordance with french law 
this securitization program  co arranged by credit commercial de france hsbc ccf  and gestion et titrisation internationales gti and managed by gti  provides for an aggregate securitization volume of up to million 
under the program  bsn glasspack services is permitted to sell receivables to the fund until november  according to the program  subject to eligibility criteria  certain  but not all  receivables held by the bsn glasspack services are sold to the fund on a weekly basis 
the purchase price for the receivables is determined as a function of the book value and the term of each receivable and a euribor three month rate increased by a margin 
a portion of the purchase price for the receivables is deferred and paid by the fund to bsn glasspack services only when receivables are collected or at the end of the program 
this deferred portion varies based on the status and updated collection history of bsn glasspack services receivable portfolio 
the transfer of the receivables to the fund is deemed to be a sale for us gaap purposes 
the fund assumes all collection risk on the receivables and the transferred receivables have been isolated from bsn glasspack services and are no longer controlled by bsn glasspack services 
the total securitization program cannot exceed million million at december  
at december   the company had million of receivables that were sold in this program 
for the period from june  through december   the company received million from the sale of receivables to the fund and paid interest of approximately million 
bsn glasspack services continues to service  administer and collect the receivables on behalf of the fund 
this service rendered to the fund is invoiced to the fund at a normal market rate 
critical accounting estimates the company s analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to pension benefit plans  contingencies and litigation  goodwill  and deferred tax assets 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where estimates and assumptions affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
the company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans  contingencies and litigation  goodwill  and deferred tax assets involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pension benefit plans the determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates 
the most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension charges or credits for the year 
the company uses discount rates based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year 
at december   the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 
the company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets 
due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets  results may vary significantly from year to year 
for example  actual returns were negative for each of the years while the return was over for and exceeded in the company refers to average historical returns over longer periods up to years in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy 
for  the company used a weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension assets of approximately compared to for the year ended december  the company recorded pension expense totaling approximately million for and pretax pension credits of million for from its principal defined benefit pension plans 
the lower pretax credits to earnings in are principally attributable to a lower asset base  higher amortization of previous actuarial losses and generally lower discount rates for compared with for 
depending on international exchange rates and including bsn for the full year  the company expects to record approximately million of pension expense for the full year of  compared with expense of million for continuing operations million total in future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance 
for example  a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately million in pretax pension expense for the full year in addition  changes in external factors  including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities  could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities 
if the accumulated benefit obligation abo of any of the company s principal pension plans in the us and australia exceeds the fair value of its assets at the next measurement date of december   the company will be required to write off the related prepaid pension asset and record a liability equal to the excess of the abo over the fair value of the asset of such plan at the next measurement date of december  the non cash charge would result in a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth 
amounts related to the company s us and australian plans as of december  were as follows millions of dollars us salary us hourly australian plans total fair value of assets   accumulated benefit obligations   excess prepaid pension asset even if the fair values of the us plans assets are less than abo at december   however  the company believes it will not be required to make cash contributions to the us plans for at least several years 
the covenants under the company s third amended and restated secured credit agreement would not be affected by a reduction in the company s net worth if a significant charge was taken to write off the prepaid pension assets 
contingencies and litigation the company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability ie  its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the company s ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the united states  the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards  the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits  the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure  and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy 
the company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims  which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years 
the company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the company 
the company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations  unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review 
if the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs  then the company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability 
the company believes that an estimation of the reasonably probable amount of the contingent liability for claims not yet asserted against the company is not possible beyond a period of several years 
therefore  while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined  the company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million million after tax to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs 
the factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of this increase included the following i the significant increase in new claim filings in  which the company believes was caused by anticipation of tort reform legislation in mississippi and texas  ii the elimination of certain co defendants from the litigation through consensually structured prepackaged bankruptcy filings  iii the number of pending serious disease cases and the relatively flat trend line in new filings of serious disease cases  and iv the limited success achieved by the company and its co defendants in eliminating forum shopping  unimpaired claim filings  and other litigation abuses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million million after tax to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs 
this amount was significantly reduced from the charge due in part to the company s decision to conduct a comprehensive review annually 
the factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of this increase included the following i the modest decline in yearly cash outlays  ii the significant decline in new claim filings against the company including a decline in filings of serious disease cases  iii the company s successful litigation record during the year  including a california appellate decision upholding its position regarding its nonliability for post claims  iv significant judicial reform in mississippi where approximately of the lawsuits against the company are pending and advantageous legislative changes in ohio affecting unimpaired claimants  and v a significant federal circuit court decision overturning a co defendant s prepackaged bankruptcy reorganization 
the company s estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill as required by fas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  the company evaluates goodwill annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
the company conducts its evaluation as of october of each year 
goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value bev of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax projected future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
this bev is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
if the company s projected future cash flows were substantially lower  or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher  the testing performed as of october   may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the company s reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would also have been written down 
however  based on the company s testing as of that date  modest changes in the projected future cash flows or cost of capital would not have created impairment in any reporting unit 
for example  if projected future cash flows had been decreased by  or alternatively  if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by  the resulting lower bev s would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit by a significant margin in all cases except for the asia pacific glass reporting unit 
because the bev for the asia pacific glass reporting unit exceeded its book value by approximately  the results of the impairment testing could be negatively affected by relatively modest changes in the assumptions and projections 
at december   the goodwill of the asia pacific glass reporting unit accounted for approximately billion of the company s consolidated goodwill 
the company will monitor conditions throughout that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to october may be appropriate 
if the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary  then the company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of  or earlier if appropriate 
in the event the company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill  the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth 
deferred tax assets fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses 
in the united states  the company has recorded significant deferred tax assets  the largest of which relate to the accrued liability for asbestos related costs that are not deductible until paid and to its net operating loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities  the most significant of which relates to the prepaid pension asset 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for its us tax credit carryforwards and us capital loss carryforward  however  it has not recorded a valuation allowance for the balance of its net us deferred tax assets 
the company believes that its projected taxable income in the us  along with a number of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  will be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses prior to their expiration 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient income from its us operations or implement the required tax planning strategies  or if the company is required to eliminate deferred tax liabilities in connection with a write off of its prepaid pension asset  then a valuation allowance will have to be provided 
it is not possible to estimate the amount of the adjustment that may be required  however  based on recorded deferred taxes at december   the related non cash tax charge could range as high as million 
the company will assess the need to provide a valuation allowance annually or more frequently  if necessary 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  and changes in commodity prices  principally natural gas 
the company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating natural gas prices 
in addition  the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed and floating rate debt and to reduce interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions 
the primary international markets served by the company s subsidiaries are in canada  australia  south america principally colombia  brazil and venezuela  and europe principally italy  france  the netherlands  germany  the united kingdom  and poland 
in general  revenues earned and costs incurred by the company s major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the company s subsidiaries operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases 
the company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the us dollar  however  if economic conditions in venezuela continue to decline  the company may have to adopt the us dollar as its functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country 
subject to other business and tax considerations  the company s strategy is to generally redeploy any subsidiary s available excess funds through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment  capital investment  or other cash requirements 
generally  each intercompany loan is denominated in the lender s local currency and the borrower enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency 
because the company s subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable where debt financing is required 
considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
in those countries where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  however  local currency borrowings expose the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the terms of the third amended and restated secured credit agreement require that borrowings under the agreement be denominated in us dollars except for the c term loan which allows for million borrowings 
in order to manage the exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates created by us dollar borrowings by the company s international subsidiaries  certain subsidiaries have entered into currency swaps for the principal amount of their borrowings under the agreement and for their interest payments due under the agreement 
at the end of  the company s subsidiary in australia had agreements that swap a total of us million of borrowings into million australian dollars 
these derivative instruments swap both the interest and principal from us dollars to australian dollars and also swap the interest rate from a us based rate to an australian based rate 
these agreements have various maturity dates ranging from april through march the company s subsidiaries in australia  canada  the united kingdom and several european countries have also entered into short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings by each subsidiary into its local currency 
these contracts swap both the interest and principal amount of borrowings 
the company recognizes the above derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value  and the company accounts for them as fair value hedges 
accordingly  the changes in the value of the swaps are recognized in current earnings and are expected to substantially offset any exchange rate gains or losses on the related us dollar borrowings 
for the year ended december   the amount not offset was immaterial 
the fair values are included with other long term liabilities on the balance sheet 
in connection with debt refinancing late in december  the company s subsidiary in france borrowed approximately million from owens brockway glass container obgc  a us subsidiary of the company 
in order to hedge the changes in the cash flows of the foreign currency interest and principal repayments  obgc entered into a swap that converts the euro coupon interest payments into a predetermined us dollar coupon interest payment and also converts the final principal payment in december from million to approximately million us dollars 
the company accounts for the above foreign currency exchange contract on the balance sheet at fair value 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as  and meets the required criteria for  a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
any material portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge that is deemed to be ineffective is recognized in current earnings 
the above foreign currency exchange contract is accounted for as a cash flow hedge at december  hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed to be highly effective at offsetting anticipated cash flows of the hedged transactions 
for hedged forecasted transactions  hedge accounting will be discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur  and any previously deferred gains or losses will be recorded to earnings immediately 
the remaining portion of the company s consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant 
the company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to local currency denominated financial instruments ie cash  short term investments  and long term debt of its subsidiaries outside the us interest rate risk the company s interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates applicable to its us dollar indebtedness 
the following table provides information about the company s significant interest rate risk at december  amount fair value hedge value dollars in millions variable rate debt secured credit agreement  matures april and revolving credit facility  interest at various rates revolving loans term loans  interest at a eurodollar based rate plus a term loan b term loan c term loan c term loan million fixed rate debt senior secured notes  due    due  due senior notes  due  due  due  due  due  due million senior debentures  due  due senior subordinated notes  due million  due million interest rate swap agreements in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion that mature from through the swaps were executed in order to i convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt  ii maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt  and iii reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term 
the company s fixed to variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges 
because the relevant terms of the swap agreements match the corresponding terms of the notes  there is no hedge ineffectiveness 
accordingly  as required by fas no 
the company recorded the net of the fair market values of the swaps as a long term liability along with a corresponding net decrease in the carrying value of the hedged debt 
under the swaps the company receives fixed rate interest amounts equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note and pays interest at a six month us libor rate set in arrears plus a margin spread see table below 
the interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense during each six month period over the term of the agreement 
the following selected information relates to fair value swaps at december  based on a projected us libor rate of amount hedged receive rate average spread asset liability recorded senior notes due senior notes due senior debentures due senior notes due total  commodity risk the company uses commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid for natural gas and the potential volatility in cash flows from future market price movements 
the company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its future usage requirements 
the company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve to eighteen months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements through the next twelve to eighteen months 
at december   the company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately approximately  mm btus of its expected north american natural gas usage for full year of and approximately approximately  mm btus for the full year of as discussed further below  prior to december   the company accounted for the above futures contracts on the balance sheet at fair value 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that was designated as  and met the required criteria for  a cash flow hedge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
any material portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge that was deemed to be ineffective was recognized in current earnings 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the commodity futures contracts described above did not meet all of the documentation requirements to qualify for special hedge accounting treatment and began to recognize all changes in fair value of these contracts in current earnings 
the total unrealized pretax gain recorded in was million million after tax 
this change had no effect upon the company s cash flows
