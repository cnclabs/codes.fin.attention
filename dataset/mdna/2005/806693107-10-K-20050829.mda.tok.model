item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview weider nutrition international  inc  currently doing business as schiff nutrition international develops  manufactures  markets  distributes and sells branded and private label vitamins  nutritional supplements and sports nutrition products in the united states and throughout the world 
we offer a broad range of capsules  tablets and nutrition bars 
our portfolio of recognized brands  including schiff and tiger s milk  primarily consist of specialty supplements  vitamins  minerals and nutrition bars and are primarily marketed through mass market and health food store distribution channels 
prior to the sales of our weider branded business and haleko unit discussed below  we also offered various powdered drink mixes and ready to drink beverages  marketed primarily through the same channels  as well as health club and gym distribution channels 
historically  our company has been organized into three business units the schiff specialty unit  the active nutrition unit and the haleko unit 
the business units have been managed independently  each with its own sales and marketing resources  and supported by common product research and development  operations and technical services and administrative functions 
the schiff specialty unit included the schiff brand  as well as private label business limited to customers that otherwise carry our products 
the active nutrition unit included our weider branded global businesses and our tiger s milk brand 
the haleko unit  our primary european operations  included the multipower and multaben nutritional supplement brands and private label businesses 
on april   we announced the sale of certain assets of our active nutrition unit relating to our weider branded business domestically and internationally to wgn  a wholly owned subsidiary of whf  a privately held company headquartered in california and our majority stockholder 
the terms of the transaction provide that we receive approximately million in exchange for assets relating to our domestic weider branded business  including inventory  receivables  and intangible and intellectual property  the capital stock of certain of our international subsidiaries related to our international weider branded business including the working capital of those subsidiaries  and the assumption of certain associated liabilities by wgn 
the transaction closed on april   with an effective date of march  on june   we announced the sale of our haleko unit to atlantic grupa of zagreb  croatia and certain of its subsidiaries for approximately million in cash 
the transaction included the sale of the capital stock and partnership interests of the international subsidiaries that operate the haleko business 
the transaction closed on june   with an effective date of may  the first day of haleko s fiscal year 
the sale of our weider branded business occurred during fiscal year accordingly  it is reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
the remaining assets and related operations for the active nutrition unit  including our tiger s milk brand  have been consolidated into our schiff specialty unit 
the sale of the haleko unit was not approved by our board of directors until fiscal year therefore  it is reflected as a separate operating segment for all fiscal years presented herein 
beginning with our fiscal first quarter  segment information will not be provided 
historical operating results for our haleko unit will be reflected as discontinued operations and all remaining assets and operations will be consolidated into our schiff specialty unit 
the following discussion of our financial results  however  includes certain historical information about both of the sold businesses 
our operating results for fiscal  and were affected by an industry slow down including lack of successful new product introductions  increased competitive pressures particularly from increasing private label growth  the implementation of our schiff move free initiatives to defend the brand against competition  and the sale of our venice beach  american body building  science foods and weider brands 
during fiscal  we experienced margin volatility due to several factors  including significant raw material pricing increases  particularly in the joint care category  and a continuing strong competitive environment 
our operating results were also impacted by the launch of lubriflex during fiscal  we continue to expect margin volatility due to raw material pricing in our joint care category and a continuing strong competitive environment 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  we began implementing our schiff grow move free initiative 
this initiative included incremental selling and marketing support intended to both defend our move free business against competition  including private label  and ultimately to increase our market share in the joint care product category 
during fiscal and  we continued our incremental selling and marketing investment in support of our move free brand 
during the fiscal second quarter  we launched our lubriflex product and have supported the introduction with significant selling and marketing support 
we believe that our overall fiscal and move free and other branded joint care category net sales benefited from these initiatives 
during fiscal  as a result of significant volatility in raw material costing and the inability to secure an acceptable price increase from the customer  we discontinued certain private label or contract manufacturing services 
although we expect selling and marketing support for joint care product initiatives to continue in fiscal  we expect branded net sales after giving effect to the subsequent sale of our haleko unit to be relatively constant due to competitive conditions and other factors 
on may  the first day of haleko s fiscal year  we sold substantially all of the assets relating to haleko s germany based venice beach sports apparel brand 
the transaction included the sale of venice beach receivables  inventories  intellectual property and certain fixed assets and the assumption by the purchaser of approximately venice beach employees 
the net cash proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 operating results for venice beach are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on july   we announced the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain associated liabilities relating to our american body building and science foods brands 
the sales price included approximately million in cash and the assumption by the buyer of an approximate million mortgage on the accompanying beverage facility 
on june   we adopted sfas no 
and recognized an after tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
factors affecting our historical results  including the previous implementation of strategic initiatives as well as continuing refinement of our growth and business strategies  are ongoing considerations and processes 
while the focus of these considerations is to improve future profitability  no assurance can be given that our decisions relating to these initiatives will not adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
the following table shows selected items as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended may dollars in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses asset impairment loss total operating expenses income from operations other expense  net income tax expense benefit income from continuing operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following tables show comparative results for continuing operations  by business unit  for fiscal and in thousands

net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in branded sales in our schiff specialty unit and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by a decrease in schiff specialty private label sales 
schiff specialty net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal aggregate branded sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal branded joint product sales volume  including lubriflex results  increased approximately million  and export sales volume increased approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in other schiff branded sales volume and a million reduction in private label sales volume 
move free net sales were million and million  respectively  for fiscal and as a result of significant volatility in raw material costing and the inability to secure an acceptable price increase  we discontinued certain private label or contract manufacturing services 
net sales for the discontinued private label business amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  for fiscal and haleko net sales  including the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  remained relatively constant for fiscal and excluding the favorable foreign currency exchange impact of approximately million  net sales decreased million  or approximately 
continuing difficult economic conditions in germany and heightened competitive pressures  resulting in reduced pricing to mass market and health club customers  contributed to a million reduction in branded sales volume 
the reduction in branded sales was partially offset by a million increase in private label sales volume 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal gross profit  and the gross profit percentage  decreased in both our schiff specialty and haleko units 
schiff specialty gross profit decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was and  respectively  for fiscal and the decrease was primarily due to a million increase in joint product raw material costs and a million increase in price discount like promotions  which are accounted for as a direct reduction of sales  partially offset by an approximate million increase resulting from a change in sales mix and a million increase resulting from a reduction in sales credits and inventory related costs 
the increase in price discount like promotions was in response to competitive pricing conditions 
we anticipate that the increased joint product raw material costs will continue to impact gross profit in fiscal haleko gross profit decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was and  respectively  for fiscal and the decrease primarily resulted from a reduction in sales volume due to economic conditions and a reduction in pricing to mass market and health club customers due to heightened competitive conditions 
the margin percentage was also negatively impacted by a higher mix of lower margin private label sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a million asset impairment loss recognized in our haleko unit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the million increase in selling and marketing expenses was more than offset by a million decrease in general and administrative expenses 
selling and marketing expenses  including sales  marketing  advertising  freight and other costs  increased to approximately million for fiscal  from million for fiscal selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million in our schiff specialty unit  and approximately million in our haleko unit 
the schiff specialty increase primarily resulted from million in marketing costs in support of our fiscal launch of lubriflex and a million increase in variable selling expenses resulting from increased sales volume  partially offset by a million increase in reclassified discount like promotions  which are accounted for as a direct reduction of sales 
the haleko increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from a million reduction in legal related costs  including approximately million in income recognized in fiscal relating to the favorable outcome of a previously recognized contingent liability 
the decrease was partially offset by the fiscal recovery of approximately million of previously recognized notes receivable valuation allowances 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in contracted research costs 
amortization of intangibles increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  due to a reduction in the estimated remaining useful lives of certain haleko trademarks 
other income expense 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal we recognized approximately million of incremental interest income in fiscal resulting from the increase in cash and short term investments 
we settled certain outstanding notes receivable in fiscal primarily through reacquiring  shares of our outstanding class a common stock 
as a result of these settlement transactions  we recognized approximately million in previously unrecognized interest income on the notes receivable 
during fiscal  we recognized a modest gain on the sale of certain assets held for sale which was substantially offset by the write down of an investment  both within our haleko unit 
we also recognized less interest expense in fiscal due to an overall reduction in total indebtedness 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million benefit for fiscal  compared to million expense for fiscal the change resulted primarily from a decrease in pre tax income and a significant decrease in our effective tax rate 
during fiscal year  we implemented a tax initiative which created a significant tax net operating loss nol 
the nol was carried back to obtain tax refunds and the remaining balance was carried forward 
at the time of the transaction  we established an approximate million valuation allowance as a contingency against potential claims from a subsequent internal revenue service irs challenge  and the potential implications to the nol carryforwards 
during fiscal year  the irs commenced an examination of the company s fiscal year us tax return and subsequently expanded the audit to include fiscal years and upon the recent conclusion of the irs audit  we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately million  which includes the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance and an adjustment for research and development credits 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following tables show comparative results for continuing operations  by business unit  for fiscal and in thousands

net sales 
net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in branded sales in our schiff specialty unit and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by the impact from the sale of our american body building and science foods brands 
fiscal net sales of american body building and science foods branded products  prior to divestiture  were million 
schiff specialty net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase primarily resulted from increases in move free and other joint product sales volume 
net sales of move free were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal we believe our fiscal move free and other branded joint category sales results benefited from our schiff grow move free initiative 
haleko net sales increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal an approximate million positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates was partially offset by volume reductions of million in branded sales and million in private label sales 
excluding foreign currency exchange rates  net sales decreased million  or approximately  primarily due to competitive pressures and economic conditions 
we re launched our leading multipower sports nutrition and multaben weight management brands during fiscal in response to sales trends 
gross profit 
gross profit increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal and schiff specialty gross profit increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was relatively constant at for fiscal  compared to for fiscal an increase in higher margin move free and other joint product sales offset the impact of reduced margins on private label sales 
haleko gross profit increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the increase resulted from the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  remained relatively constant at and  respectively  for fiscal and operating expenses 
operating expenses increased approximately to million fiscal  from million for fiscal the overall increase was primarily attributable to increases in selling and marketing costs in support of our brand building initiatives for all business units and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
selling and marketing expenses  including sales  marketing  advertising  freight and other costs  were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from million in incremental transition and marketing costs associated with our grow move free initiative  million in increased selling and marketing in support of new products in our schiff specialty unit and an approximate million foreign currency exchange rate impact in our haleko unit 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal increases in aggregate legal related costs of approximately million were partially offset by the fiscal recovery of approximately million of previously recognized notes receivable valuation allowances and reduced haleko systems and personnel related costs  including impact from the sale of venice beach 
foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses 
research and development costs remained relatively constant at million and million  respectively  for fiscal and amortization of intangible assets also remained relatively constant at million and million  respectively  for fiscal and other expense 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal we settled certain outstanding notes receivable in fiscal primarily through reacquiring  shares of our outstanding class a common stock 
as a result of these settlement transactions  we recognized approximately million in previously unrecognized interest income on the notes receivable 
we recognized less interest expense in fiscal due to an overall reduction in total indebtedness 
we recognized a modest gain on the sale of certain assets held for sale in fiscal which was substantially offset by the write down of an investment  both within our haleko unit 
in november  we paid off million in remaining subordinated debt with borrowings available from our senior bank credit facility  which resulted in an approximate million write off of previously capitalized financing fees during fiscal finally  we recognized an approximate million gain on the sale of certain held for sale equity securities during fiscal provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the change resulted primarily from the decrease in pre tax earnings  and a modest reduction in our effective tax rate due to utilization of certain fully reserved capital loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased million to approximately million at may   from million at may  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from an increase in cash  short term investments and inventories  partially offset by a decrease in receivables and an increase in current income taxes payable 
the increase in cash and short term investments was primarily due to operating cash flows and the sale of the weider branded business 
the increase in inventories primarily resulted from an increase in joint care product and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
the decrease in receivables resulted primarily from lower sales in the fiscal fourth quarter  as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter  and the sale of the weider branded business 
current income taxes payable increased due to an increase in pre tax income for tax reporting purposes 
effective june   we were party to a senior credit facility the credit facility with bankers trust company  on behalf of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility  as subsequently amended  was comprised of a million revolving loan 
the credit facility  which was being used to fund normal working capital and capital expenditure requirements  was terminated on june  in favor of a new credit facility discussed below 
our domestic operations were also supported by a subordinated loan the subordinated loan obtained in conjunction with the credit facility 
effective november   we used funds available under our revolving loan to pay off the remaining million of the subordinated loan 
as a result of the repayment of the subordinated loan  during fiscal we recognized write offs of approximately million of previously capitalized financing fees  including oid costs 
on june   we entered into  through our wholly owned direct operating subsidiary weider nutrition group  inc wng  a new million revolving credit facility the new credit facility with keybank national association  as agent 
the new credit facility contains customary terms and conditions  including  among others  financial covenants and certain restrictions 
our obligations under the new credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest on all of the capital stock of wng 
if our total coverage ratio exceeds a certain limit  our obligations will also be secured by a first priority security interest in all of our domestic assets 
in the event we exceed certain other ratio limits  we will be subject to a borrowing base and will be able to borrow up to a lesser of million or the sum of i of eligible accounts receivable and ii of eligible inventory 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at floating rates based on the keybank national association prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  and the new credit facility matures on june   with options for one year extensions under certain circumstances 
the new credit facility can be used to fund our normal working capital and capital expenditure requirements  with availability to fund certain permitted strategic transactions 
at may   there were no amounts outstanding and million was available for borrowing under the new credit facility 
our european working capital needs primarily our haleko business unit were supported by a germany based secured credit facility the haleko facility that was subject to annual renewal in or around june 
our obligations under the haleko facility were secured by a first priority lien on substantially all haleko tangible and intangible assets 
at may   amounts outstanding under the haleko facility were approximately million and available revolving loan funds were approximately million 
in connection with the sale of our haleko unit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the purchaser assumed the liabilities and obligations under the haleko facility 
we believe that our cash  cash flows from operations and the financing sources discussed above will be sufficient to meet our normal cash operating requirements during the next twelve months 
however  we continue to review opportunities to acquire or invest in companies  product rights and other investments that are compatible with our existing business 
we could use cash and financing sources discussed herein  or financing sources that subsequently become available  to fund additional acquisitions or investments 
in addition  we may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or growth  or to refinance existing debt 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
however  no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  to fund such activities 
our board of directors will determine dividend policy in the future based upon  among other factors  results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant at the time 
in addition  our credit facilities contain certain customary financial covenants that may limit our ability to pay common stock dividends 
we can give no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future 
a summary of our outstanding contractual obligations for continuing operations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at may  is as follows in thousands contractual cash obligations total amounts committed less than year years years after years debt obligations  including interest operating leases purchase obligations total obligations purchase obligations primarily consist of open purchase orders for goods and services  including primarily raw materials  packaging and outsourced contract manufacturing commitments 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to the valuation of inventories and intangible assets  allowances for doubtful accounts  notes receivable  sales returns and discounts  valuation of deferred tax assets and recoverability of long lived assets 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the following accounting policies affect some of our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements we provide for inventory valuation adjustments for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory valuation adjustments resulted in a decrease to gross profit of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal  and our inventory valuation allowance amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  at may  and if actual demand and or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs would be required 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and discounts for estimated losses resulting from known customer exposures  including among others  product returns  inability to make payments and expected utilization of offered discounts 
changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts  notes receivable  sales returns and discounts did not materially impact our earnings for fiscal years   and increases in schiff specialty allowances for sales returns  primarily resulting from the risks associated with the launch of new products  were substantially offset by decreases in allowances for sales returns in our active nutrition unit 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  sales returns and discounts amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  at may  and actual results may differ resulting in adjustment of the respective allowance s 
we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from certain loss carry forwards and other temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
these deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future operating results 
to the extent that it is more likely than not  that future operations will not generate sufficient profit to utilize the loss carry forwards  valuation allowances are established 
our deferred tax asset valuation allowances amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  at may  and we have significant intangible assets  including primarily goodwill 
in connection with the sale of our haleko unit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we recognized an impairment loss pertaining to our trademarks and patents of approximately million in fiscal the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not goodwill is impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact our judgment and require adjustments to our recorded goodwill balance 
impact of inflation historically  we generally have been able to pass inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs on to our customers through price increases 
while we will continue efforts to do so in the future  we cannot assure you that we will be successful 
recently  we have been unable to pass on increased raw material costs relating to our joint care products 
see further discussion of raw material pricing matters in the general and results of operations sections above 
seasonality our business can be seasonal  with fluctuations in sales resulting from timing of marketing and promotional activities  customer buying patterns and consumer spending patterns 
in addition  as a result of changes in product sales mix  competitive conditions  raw material pricing pressures and other factors  as discussed above  we experience fluctuations in gross profit and operating margins on a quarter to quarter basis 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as a current period expense 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the inventory costing provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that costs resulting from all share based payment transactions  a transaction in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  be recognized in the financial statements 
costs resulting from all share based payment transactions will be determined by applying a fair value based measurement method at the date of the grant  with limited exceptions 
costs will be recognized over the period in which the goods or services are received 
the recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for all share based payment transactions entered into during fiscal years beginning after june  we have not determined the impact sfas no 
r will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and net earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
prior to the sale of out haleko unit referred to under recent developments above  we were party to one modest derivative instrument relating to our haleko unit 
our current investment policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposure 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
since we have subsidiaries whose net sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar may impact our reported net earnings 
the us dollar volume of these foreign currency denominated net sales was approximately million  or of total net sales  for the year ended may  following the sale of our haleko unit referred to under recent developments above  we anticipate that the portion of our total net sales relating to foreign currency denominated sales will significantly decrease 
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an approximate million increase in net sales for fiscal the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on operating income was negligible for the same time period 
we measure market risk  related to our holdings of financial instruments  based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
we do not believe that a hypothetical change in interest rates would have a material effect on pretax earnings or cash flows
