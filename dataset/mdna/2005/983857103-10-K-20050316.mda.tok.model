on a consolidated basis  we have been able to maintain a strong margin with slight increases for the past several years due to the following factors improved manufacturing absorption in color products foreign exchange rates change in product mix acquisitions the combination of increased sales volumes and favorable foreign exchange rates allowed for higher absorption of factory overhead costs and increased profitability on certain foreign sales  as the underlying product cost was denominated in us dollars

net other income in was nominal 
write down of other investments other investments include investments made by the company s strategic venture capital group  xr ventures  llc xrv see other investments  for additional information 
each investment represents less than percent of the ownership of the respective portfolio companies 
since the company does not exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of each portfolio company  the investments have been recorded at cost 
the company periodically evaluated the carrying value of each investment to determine whether a decline in fair value below the respective cost has occurred 
if the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value is adjusted to the then current fair value and a loss is recognized 
at various times in and the company performed comprehensive assessments of the continuing value of each xr ventures investment 
based on the continued erosion of the venture capital markets  the technology sectors of the economy and specific reviews of its portfolio  the company concluded that the value of its investments had been permanently impaired 
therefore  the company recorded charges of  and million in march  june and december of  respectively  for a total of million for the year 
the company recorded charges of and million in june and december  respectively  for a combined total of million for the year 
at january   all venture capital investments had been fully impaired 
although the company continues to hold positions in several xr ventures portfolio companies  no future investments in the remaining portfolio companies will be made  except where necessary to protect any existing investments 
in and  the company concluded that it may not be able to realize certain capital losses it incurred prior to their expiration related to these impairments 
therefore  it did not record a tax benefit at that time 
in  the company re evaluated this position and concluded that the execution of certain qualified tax strategies which the company was capable of completing  would allow for the realization of capital gains within the expiration period 
accordingly  a tax benefit of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the prior years impairments 
income taxes for  the company recorded an income tax provision of million  an effective rate of percent 
the effective tax rate has benefited from the execution of certain international tax strategies and research and development tax credits 
a tax benefit of million was recorded in the third quarter of as a result of amended filings of our through tax positions related to research and development credits 

table of contents the company has not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of january  because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states and certain of these entities are pass through tax entities 
where excess cash has accumulated in non us subsidiaries and it is advantageous for business operations  tax or cash reasons  subsidiary earnings would be remitted 
if these earnings were distributed  foreign tax credits may become available under current law to reduce or eliminate the resulting us income tax liability 
the company has not reevaluated its position with respect to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings to take into account the possible election of the repatriation provisions contained in the american jobs creation act of the status of this evaluation of these provisions is described in the following section 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by the company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
the company s one year period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is fiscal the company is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act  and if so  the amount that will be repatriated 
the range of reasonably possible amounts that could be repatriated  which would be eligible for the temporary deduction  has not been determined at this time  nor the impact of a qualifying repatriation  should it choose to make one  on its income tax expense for  the amount of its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings  or the amount of its deferred tax liability with respect to foreign earnings 
the company is awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the jobs act prior to determining the amounts if any  it will repatriate 
the company expects to complete its evaluation to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated  if any  during the third quarter of the company recorded a tax benefit of million in against pre tax income of million 
this benefit reflects the reversal of million in deferred tax valuation reserves established in and the first three quarters of these valuation reserves were originally recorded in connection with the write downs of the xrv investment portfolio in and at that time  the company was not assured that these write downs would be fully deductible capital losses and a valuation allowance was established 
in the december  a qualified tax strategy was put in place that would allow for the ultimate realization of capital gains within the expiration period and accordingly the valuation allowance was reversed 
exclusive of the valuation allowance reversal  the company s effective tax rate would have been percent compared to the us statutory rate of percent 
the increase over the statutory rate is primarily attributable to the effect of certain non deductible foreign losses  expenses related to the adoption of sfas for the founders program and state income taxes 
the company recorded a tax provision of million in against a loss before taxes and the cumulative effective of change in accounting principle of million 
the provision was adjusted by the potential non deductible capital losses associated with the write down of investments by xr ventures  llc 
exclusive of these write downs  the company would have had approximately a percent tax rate in  compared to the us statutory rate of percent 
this lower rate was due to tax reductions received as a result of the company s foreign sales operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill  and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires companies to discontinue amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite life 
instead  companies are required to review goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment annually and as indicators of impairment occur 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  the company completed steps one and two of the transitional testing required by sfas no 
 as well as  the annual impairment testing requirement 
step two testing was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation firm during the fourth quarter of under sfas no  goodwill impairment exists if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company evaluated goodwill using three reporting units  labsphere and optronik combined  coherix  and x rite mediterranee 

table of contents upon completion of the step two transitional testing for the labsphere and optronik combined reporting unit  it was determined that an impairment of goodwill had occurred 
therefore  a non cash charge of million  or cents per share  was recorded and classified as a cumulative change in accounting principle as required by sfas no 
in the first quarter of the decline in fair value of the labsphere and optronik reporting unit was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue and profitability for the unit 
this decline led to a reduction in the three to five year projection of operating earnings for the unit 
the fair value of the remaining units exceeded their net book value  therefore  no impairment charges were recorded for these units 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this methodology was selected over the market value approach  due to a lack of comparable competitor data availability  which is necessary to complete a market value study 
liquidity and capital resources as highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows  our liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components i current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  ii operating activities  iii investing activities and iv financing activities

the operating cash flows primarily resulted from net income of million adjusted for non cash items of million  which was offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities of million 
the most significant non cash adjustment to cash flow was million for depreciation and amortization 
fourth quarter sales volumes drove much of the change in operating assets and liabilities  as receivables increased million while inventory levels decreased million as compared to other current and non current liabilities decreased million in  reflecting lower payouts on certain incentive compensation awards  completion of two executive severance packages and recognition of deferred revenue on the sale of the coherix assets

in  net cash provided by operating activities was comprised of net income of million adjusted for non cash items of million and net cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million

these adjustments were offset by an increase in deferred taxes of million 
net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by an increase in other accrued liabilities  which includes accrued payroll and benefits  income taxes and miscellaneous liabilities

statement generally requires liability classification for classes of financial instruments that represent  or are indexed to  an obligation to buy back the issuer s shares 
many of the financial instruments within the scope of statement were previously classified by the issuer as equity or temporary equity

on july  upon reversal of these charges  the remaining million representing the fair value of the redemption agreements at july   was reclassified to shareholder s investment

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in some instances  there may be alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
management maintains a thorough process to review the application of accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to the financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable allowances are based on known customer exposures  historic credit experience  and the specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
in addition to known or judgmental components  a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable is followed 
actual collections may differ requiring adjustments to the reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these to current inventory levels 
reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement  market conditions  and technological advancements 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with benefits paid under employee health care programs 
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historic loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
these costs are accounted for by developing estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
this method provides estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
long lived assets evaluations are periodically made of long lived assets and the company s venture capital investments for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on several factors including but not limited to  market conditions  operational performance  technological advancements and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its fair value 
goodwill the company has million of goodwill recorded as of january   related to prior acquisitions 
accounting standards require that goodwill must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and as indicators of impairment occur  and the cessation of amortization 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded it cannot be reversed 
deferred tax valuation allowance the company periodically evaluates its deferred tax assets to assess the probability of their being ultimately realized 
upon determination that a deferred tax asset may not be realized a valuation allowance is established for the potential unrealizable amount 
this evaluation process requires a review of the underlying transaction to determine that the conditions that led to the creation of the asset still exist and that the related tax benefit will be realized 

table of contents risk factors there are many risk factors that may adversely affect our operating results  risk factors that we deem critical include the following vertical integration the company s manufacturing processes are vertically integrated 
therefore  it is critical to efficiently manage the cost structure for capital expenditures  materials and overhead  as well as operating expenses such as wages and benefits 
intellectual property rights the company has made significant expenditures to develop and acquire technology and intellectual property rights 
we actively patent and trademark these properties whenever possible and will vigorously defend them against infringement 
as sales of our products continue to grow internationally  our exposure to intellectual property infringements in countries  where intellectual property rights protections are less stringent will increase 
new products and services the company has made large investments in new products and services 
there are no assurances as to when future revenues from these products will be received  or that the ultimate profit margins received will be adequate to justify the investment 
timely product delivery continual development of new products and technologies as well as enhancements to existing products is a core component of our long term growth plans 
product development requires a time consuming and costly research and development process 
unexpected delays in this process may significantly affect the timing of future revenues and increase costs 
general economic conditions many of our products are used for quality control purposes within a larger manufacturing or production process 
as such  our sales in some instances are linked to capital goods spending 
additionally  over percent of our sales are to customers outside of north america 
should there be a prolonged slowdown in capital goods spending or changes in global economic conditions  our revenues and profitability would be noticeably impacted 
competition our primary markets are well served and competitively priced 
if we are not able to differentiate our products and services in the market then competitive pressures may potentially impact our sales volumes  pricing structure  gross margin  operating expenses an operating income 
potential tax liabilities the company is subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in the united states  europe  and asia 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax liability cannot be determined with certainty 
preparation of our income tax provision requires the use of judgments as to how these transactions will be ultimately taxed 
we believe our tax accruals are accurate though the ultimate determination of these issues may be different from that which is reflected in our historical provision and accruals 
should these determinations be different from what is previously recorded and additional tax is assessed  those assessments would be recorded in the period in which they occur 
business disruptions manufacturing and service of much of our core color products is performed at our headquarters facility in the united states 
should a catastrophic event occur at that facility the company s ability to manufacture product  complete exist orders  and provide other services would be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time 
the company has purchased business interruption insurance to cover the costs of an event of this magnitude 
our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on long term operating results 
currency fluctuations the company s international presence continues to grow 
with this growth is the requirement to conduct business in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these currencies fluctuate against the dollar they may reduce the profitability of our products sold in those currencies or causes them to be non competitive in the market 
additionally  currency fluctuations may negatively impact the costs of conducting business in certain locations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has no significant off balance sheet transactions other than operating leases for equipment  real estate  and vehicles 
it also is not the company s policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
the following table summarizes the company s future operating lease obligations by year 
in millions other matters in november of  the company s board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan the plan  which became effective in the first quarter of the plan is designed to protect shareholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the company in a manner that does not offer a fair price to all shareholders 
under the plan  one purchase right automatically trades with each share of the company s common stock 
each right entitles a shareholder to purchase of a share of junior participating preferred stock at a price of  if any person or group attempts certain hostile takeover tactics toward the company 
under certain hostile circumstances  each right may entitle the holder to purchase the company s common stock at one half its market value or to purchase the securities of any acquiring entity at one half their market value 
rights are subject to redemption by the company at 
per right and  unless earlier redeemed  will expire in the first quarter rights beneficially owned by holders of percent or more of the company s common stock  or their transferees and affiliates  automatically become void 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  and market volatility in its investment and insurance portfolios 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established procedures to evaluate its risks and take corrective actions when necessary to manage these exposures 
the company is not a party to any derivative instruments 
foreign exchange foreign currency exchange risks arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency and from foreign denominated transactions translated into us dollars 
the company s largest exposures are to the euro and british pound sterling 
as these currencies fluctuate relative to the dollar  it may cause profitability to increase or decrease accordingly
