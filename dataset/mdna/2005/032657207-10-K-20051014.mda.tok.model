item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of exchange act 
all statements  other than statements of historical fact  the company makes in this document or in any document incorporated by reference are forward looking 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance  or achievements of the company to differ from the projected results 
see risk factors below 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the sec considers critical accounting policies to be the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the case of the company s critical accounting policies  these judgments are based on its historical experience  terms of existing contracts  the company s observance of trends in the industry  information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company s critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates include revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company recognizes the majority of its revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for product sales with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company s sales contracts generally provide for the customer to accept title and risk of loss when the product leaves the company s facilities 
when shipping terms or local laws do not allow for passage of title and risk of loss at the shipping point  the company defers recognizing revenue until title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of sales 
the company s transactions sometimes involve multiple elements ie  systems and services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under this method  if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is based on fair value and determined by verifiable objective evidence  and recognized at the time of delivery 
if the arrangement has an undelivered element  the company ensures that they have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
maintenance or service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contracts 
for business units that sell software licenses or products in which the software is considered more than incidental  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa s statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
license revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant obligations with regards to installation or implementation remain  fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and customer acceptance  when applicable  is obtained 
we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
hardware and software maintenance is marketed under annual and multi year arrangements and revenue is recognized ratably over the contracted maintenance term 
as it relates to services  camtronics may also provide services that vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the customer 
examples of such services include additional database consulting  system configuration  project management  interfacing to existing systems  and network consulting 
services generally are not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software 
if camtronics has vsoe for the services  the timing of the software license revenue is not impacted 
if the company does have vsoe  service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
camtronics commonly performs services for which the company does not have vsoe  accordingly  the software license revenue is deferred until the services are completed 

table of contents the company provides engineering services to some of its customers on a contractual basis and recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the company estimates the percentage of completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs to complete the project 
if the company does not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  the company accrues for the estimated losses immediately 
deferred revenue is comprised of license fee  maintenance and other service revenues for which payment has been received and for which services have not yet been performed and revenues related to delivered components of a multiple element arrangement for which vsoe of fair value has not been determined for components not yet delivered or accepted by the customer 
deferred costs represent costs related to these revenues  for example  costs of goods sold and services provided and sales commission expenses 
revenue related to the hotel operations is recognized as services are performed 
the company grants credit to domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers  distributors  and end users  and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary for excess and obsolete inventory 
the write downs are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory 
if actual demand for the company s products is less than its estimates  or the company experiences a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional write downs for existing inventories may be recorded in future periods 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and accounts receivable 
the company maintains a bond investment portfolio of various types and maturities with high credit quality issuers 
cash and cash equivalents not required for working capital purposes are placed in short term investments with original maturities for six months or less 
the company grants credit to domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers  distributors  and end users  and performs ongoing credit evaluations on its customers financial condition 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  there is no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since the accounts receivable are concentrated among relatively few customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
warranty reserve the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  its warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred to correct product failures 
should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates which are based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable  revisions to the 
table of contents estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect the company s operating results 
generally  the company warrants that its products will perform in all material respects in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the products to the customer for a period ranging from to months from the date of delivery 
investments in and advances to affiliated companies the company has investments in affiliated companies related to areas of the company s strategic focus 
investment in companies over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method if the company holds or less of the voting stock 
investments in companies over which the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method 
in assessing the recoverability of these investments  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments based upon changes in the company s overall business strategy  the financial condition of the affiliated companies  market conditions  and the industry and economic environment in which the entities operate 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of affiliated companies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  intellectual property  licenses  and capitalized software 
other long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant  and equipment 
these assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the first quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions within which it operates 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not more than likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company establishes liabilities for possible assessments by taxing authorities resulting from known tax exposures including  but not limited to certain tax credits  and various federal  state and foreign tax matters 
the company does not provide for us federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries  as such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in those operations 
determination of the potential deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable because such liability  if any  is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 
the american jobs act of creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations 
based on the company s analysis  this provision will not provide a benefit to the company

new accounting pronouncements in june  financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principles 
fas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principles unless it is not practical to do so 
apb no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
fas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and errors made occurring in fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations on december   the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to 
table of contents be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted in fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted sfas r on august   the commencement of its first quarter of fiscal the company adopted the modified prospective transition method in which awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas  except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r 
in particular  sab provides supplemental implementation guidance on sfas r  including guidance on valuation methods  classification of compensation expense  inventory capitalization of share based compensation cost  income tax effects  disclosures in management s discussion of an analysis and several other issues 
the company will apply the principles of sab in conjunction with its adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued the fasb staff positions fsp eitf  application of eitf no 
to freestanding financial instruments originally issued as employee compensation 
this fsp clarifies that a requirement to deliver registered shares  in and of itself  will not result in a liability classification for freestanding financial instruments originally issued as employee compensation 
the adoption of fsp eitf no 
will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operation 
in december  the fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas clarifies the accounting for inventory when there are abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials 
under existing gaap  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges rather than recorded as adjustments to the value of the inventory 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date sfas was issued 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the ajca was passed 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities which will be phased in from though the ajca also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp treats the deduction as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the same period in which the deduction is claimed in the company s tax return 
the company is currently evaluating the impact the ajca will have on its results of operations and financial position 
the ajca also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign 
table of contents corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations 
based on the company s analysis  this provision of the ajca will not produce a benefit to the company 
in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investment 
eitf 
eitf provides guidance on determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments on debt and equity investments 
in september  the fasb delayed until further notice the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf  however  the disclosure requirements of eitf are currently effective 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains statements  which  to the extent that they are not recitation of historical facts  constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements about product development  market and industry trends  strategic initiatives  regulatory approvals  sales  profits  expenses  price trends  research and development expenses and trends  and capital expenditures involve risk and uncertainties  and actual events and results may differ significantly from those indicated in any forward looking statement as a result of a number of important factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere herein 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to analogic common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business 
any of these could have a material and negative effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
because a significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a small number of customers  any decrease in revenue from these customers could harm our operating results 
we depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business  and changes in our customers orders may have a significant impact on our operating results 
if a major customer significantly reduces the amount of business it does with us  there would be an adverse impact on our operating results 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our net product and engineering revenue from our five largest customers in each of the last three fiscal years and the percentage of our product and engineering sales to our ten largest customers during these periods year ended july  l communications toshiba general electric siemens philips ten largest customers as a group although we are seeking to broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of major customers 
because it often takes significant time to replace lost business  it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel  
table of contents delay  or reduce significant orders in the future 
our customer agreements typically permit the customer to discontinue future purchases after timely notice 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with the products we sell and the services we provide to our major customers 
although our major customers are large corporations  if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise be unable to pay for our products and services  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
competition from existing or new companies in the medical and security imaging technology industry could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities  and the loss of market share 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we are subject to competition based upon product design  performance  pricing  quality  and services and we believe our innovative engineering and product reliability have been important factors in our growth 
while we try to maintain competitive pricing on those products which are directly comparable to products manufactured by others  in many instances our products will conform to more exacting specifications and carry a higher price than analogous products manufactured by others 
our competitors include divisions of some larger  more diversified organizations as well as several specialized companies 
some of them have greater resources and larger staffs than we have 
many of our oem customers and potential oem customers have the capacity to design and manufacture internally the products we manufacture for them 
we face competition from research and product development groups and the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who continually evaluate the benefits of internal research and product development and manufacturing versus outsourcing 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for our components  and our production would be substantially curtailed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demands and alternative sources are not available 
we order raw materials and components to complete our customers orders  and some of these raw materials and components are ordered from sole source suppliers 
although we work with our customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components  we sometimes experience short term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments 
in the past  there have been industry wide shortages of electronics components 
if a significant shortage of raw materials or components were to occur  we might have to delay shipments or pay premium pricing  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in some cases  supply shortages of particular components will substantially curtail production of products using these components 
we are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers 
accordingly  some raw material and component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
we also depend on a small number of suppliers  some of which are affiliated with customers or competitors and others of which may be small  poorly financed companies  for many of the other raw materials and components that we use in our business 
if we are unable to continue to purchase these raw materials and components from our suppliers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
because many of our costs are fixed  our margins depend on our volume of output at our facilities and a reduction in volume could adversely affect our margins 
if we are left with excess inventory  our operating results will be adversely affected 
because of long lead times and specialized product designs  we typically purchase components and manufacture products in anticipation of customer orders based on customer forecasts 
for a variety of reasons  such as decreased end user demand for our products  our customers might not purchase all the products we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components 
in either event  we would attempt to recoup our materials and manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors  disposing of excess inventory through other channels or requiring our oem customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory 
some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the 
table of contents ability to require our oem customers to do this 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs  not only would our net sales be adversely affected  but also our operating results would be disproportionately adversely affected 
moreover  carrying excess inventory would reduce the working capital we have available to continue to operate and grow our business 
uncertainties and adverse trends affecting our industry or any of our major customers may adversely affect our operating results 
our business operates primarily within two major markets within the electronics industry  medical technology products and security technology products  which are subject to rapid technological change and pricing and margin pressure 
these markets have historically been cyclical and subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and production over capacity 
in addition  changes in government policy relating to reimbursement for the purchase and use of medical and security related capital equipment could also affect our sales 
our customers markets are also subject to economic cycles and are likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting our industry in general  or any of our major customers in particular  might adversely affect our operating results 
our other businesses are subject to the same or greater technological and cyclical pressures 
our customers delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for their products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are used by a number of our customers in the production of medical devices that are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight 
a delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a further risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  might be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or clearance from the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda rules and regulations  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage  and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale  and use of medical devices 
medical devices are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
our business strategy involves the pursuit of acquisitions or business combinations  which may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
as part of our business strategy  we may consummate acquisitions or business combinations 
acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
if we do not successfully complete acquisitions that we pursue in the future  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete proposed acquisitions that will not generate benefits for us 
in addition  substantial portions of our available cash might be utilized as consideration for these acquisitions 
our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations  which could affect the market price of our common stock 
our annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control  and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
these factors include variations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products  
table of contents changes in demand for our customers existing products  the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets  changes in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor  foreign currency exposure  and investor and analyst perceptions of events affecting the company  our competitors and or our industry 
as is the case with many technology companies  we typically ship a significant portion of our products in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  any delay in anticipated sales is likely to result in the deferral of the associated revenue beyond the end of a particular quarter  which would have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  most of our operating expenses do not vary directly with net sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if net sales for a particular quarter were below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and  therefore  that revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their industry experience and their technological expertise 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and depend on the services of our key senior executives and our technological experts 
the loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically engineering and operations personnel  could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
if we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in research and product development and manufacturing processes  we will not be able to successfully compete 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to provide research and product development and manufacturing services that meet the changing needs of our customers 
this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost effective and timely manner 
as a result  we continually evaluate the advantages and feasibility of new product design and manufacturing processes 
we cannot  however  be certain that our development efforts will be successful 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces limited exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s primary exposure is related to fluctuations between the us dollar and local currencies for the company s subsidiaries in canada and europe 
the company maintains a bond investment portfolio of various types and maturities with high credit quality issuers 
cash and cash equivalents not required for working capital purposes are placed in short term investments with original maturities for six months or less 
investments having original maturities in excess of six months are stated at fair value  and are classified as available for sale 
total interest income for fiscal was million 
an interest rate change of would not have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio or on future earnings
