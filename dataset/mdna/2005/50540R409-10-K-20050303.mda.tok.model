new accounting pronouncements in december the financial standards accounting board fasb issued fas r  share based payment revised 
this statement is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the company has not finalized what  if any  changes may be made to its equity compensation plans in light of the accounting change  and therefore is not yet in a position to quantify its impact 
the company expects to announce the impact in connection with reporting its second quarter financial results 
the impact on cash from operations of adopting the new accounting standard cannot be estimated at this time 
see note to consolidated financial statements for proforma impact of expensing all equity based compensation  which the company believes would approximate the annual effect of adopting the new accounting standard 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in statement as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
this statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans  which are subject to aicpa statement of position  employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
in december  the fasb issued fas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this statement amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
that statement is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception to for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the company has not historically entered into a significant level of nonmonetary transactions and therefore does not expect that this standard will impact is financial position or results unless nonmonetary transactions are utilized in the future 
this statement is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  contractual cash obligations payments due by period yrs capital lease obligations operating leases contingent future licensing payments a minimum royalty payments minimum purchase obligations scheduled principal on senior notes scheduled interest payments on senior notes zero coupon subordinated notes b total contractual cash obligations a contingent future licensing payments will be made if certain events take place  such as the launch of a specific test  the transfer of certain technology  and when specified revenue milestones are met 
b holders of the zero coupon subordinated notes may require the company to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes on september  and at prices ranging from to per note 
should the holders put the notes to the company on any of the dates above  the company believes that it will be able to satisfy this contingent obligation with cash on hand  borrowings on the revolving credit facility  and additional financing if necessary 
c the table does not include obligations under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans which are included in note to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to contribute approximately million to its defined pension plan during  although it is not legally required to do so 
benefits under the company s postretirement medical plan are made when claims are submitted for payment  the timing of which are not practicable to estimate 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have transactions or relationships with special purpose entities  and the company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates include the allowances for doubtful accounts  pension expense  amortization lives for intangible assets  accruals for self insurance reserves  income taxes and reserves for professional liability claims 
allowances for doubtful accounts revenue is recognized for services rendered when test results are reported to the ordering physician and the testing process is complete 
the company s sales are generally billed to three types of payers clients  patients and third parties  such as managed care companies  medicare and medicaid 
for clients  sales are recorded on a fee for service basis at the company s client list price  less any negotiated discount 
patient sales are recorded at the company s patient fee schedule  net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients 
the company bills third party payers in two ways fee for service and capitated agreements 
fee for service third party payers are billed at the company s patient fee schedule amount  and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts 
these discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is maintained for each third party payer 
the majority of the company s third party sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale 
for the remaining third party sales  estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer 
adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue 
these adjustments are not material to the company s results of operations in any period presented 
the company periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends 
under capitated agreements with managed care companies  the company recognizes revenue based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the number or costs of services performed 
the company has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding 
bad debt expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level 
the company s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment  and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables  historical and projected collection experience  and other external factors that could affect the collectibility of its receivables 
accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the company s write off policy eg when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
in the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance  accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within the company s receivables 
these collection and reserve processes  along with the close monitoring of the billing process  help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience 
the following table presents the percentage of the company s net accounts receivable outstanding by aging category at december  and days outstanding over pension expense 
the company s net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plans were a discount rate and an expected return on plan assets as of december  in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption  the company reviews asset allocation considering plan maturity and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses 
actual asset over under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease increase unrecognized loss 
the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods 
a one percentage point change in the expected return assumption in the current year would have resulted in a change in pension expense of approximately million 
current year net pension cost was million  a decrease of million from our actuaries have estimated that net pension cost should be comparable to or slightly less than fiscal net pension cost 
favorable asset performance in and contributions to plan assets will cause a reduction in net pension cost for fiscal however  the decrease in the discount rate assumption during fiscal will cause an offsetting increase in net pension cost for accruals for self insurance reserves 
accruals for self insurance reserves including workers compensation  auto and employee medical are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history  along with current and estimated future economic conditions 
the company is self insured for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business  generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results 
the company records an accrual for such claims payable and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual driven by frequency and amounts of claims  which is performed at least annually 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent  they are by their very nature  estimates of amounts that will depend on future events 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s audit committee periodically reviews the company s significant accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of significant accounting policies 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not
