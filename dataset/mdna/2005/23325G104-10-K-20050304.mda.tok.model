item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global medical device company specializing in rehabilitation and regeneration products for the non operative orthopedic and spine markets 
our broad range of over rehabilitation products  including rigid knee braces  soft goods  and pain management products  are used to prevent injury  to treat chronic conditions and to aid in recovery after surgery or injury 
our regeneration products consist of bone growth stimulation devices that are used to treat nonunion fractures and as an adjunct therapy after spinal fusion surgery 
we sell our products in the united states and in more than other countries through networks of agents  distributors and our direct sales force that market our products to orthopedic and spine surgeons  podiatrists  orthopedic and prosthetic centers  third party distributors  hospitals  surgery centers  physical therapists  athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals 
acquisitions and other recent transactions on november   we acquired the bone growth stimulation device business from orthologic  which we now call our regeneration business 
following the regeneration acquisition in november  we operated the regeneration business as a stand alone division in tempe  arizona with a sales force separate from our domestic rehabilitation product sales force 
in august  we began the integration of the former regeneration sales force into our domestic rehabilitation sales organization  and we took the first steps towards integrating most of the other regeneration operations into our corporate facility in vista  california 
by the end of  we completed the integration of most of the regeneration operations except for the assembly and calibration operations which we expect to move to vista in the first quarter of following site approval of the us food and drug administration 
one of the principal objectives of the integration is to enhance the sales and distribution activities of the regeneration business to capture more of the growth opportunities in the regeneration market 
in addition  we believe the integration will enable us to reduce both costs of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in future periods  after the related costs of the integration have been incurred 
the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes restructuring charges totaling approximately million million net of tax 
the costs of the integration were primarily severance  recruiting and training 
in august  we completed construction of a new  square foot leased facility in tijuana  mexico  to replace three separate facilities we operated in the same area and to provide further opportunities to expand our mexico manufacturing operations 
as of early october  all of our existing mexico facilities had been moved to this new facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the relocation of the manufacturing of our cold therapy products and machine shop activities from vista  california to the new mexico plant 
we recorded restructuring charges of million million net of tax in related to these manufacturing moves  including primarily severance and moving costs 
on august   we acquired the outstanding stock of kd innovation a s kdi  our independent distributor in denmark 
the acquired company  renamed dj orthopedics nordic aps dj nordic  has direct responsibility for sales  marketing and distribution of our products in denmark  finland  norway and sweden 
the stock purchase agreement provided for the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock for kdi for an initial cash purchase price of million  paid in october  plus amounts aggregating up to an additional million through if certain net operating income targets are met 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby a total purchase price of approximately million  including the portion of the contingent future payments that are deemed by management to be probable  was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
during the year ended december   we purchased rights to certain distributor territories in the us  for amounts aggregating million  in connection with a reorganization of the distribution activities within such territories 
these reorganizations are intended to achieve several objectives  including improvement of sales results within the affected territories and reduction of our distribution costs within such territories for a defined period of time 
purchase price aggregating million was capitalized as an intangible asset and will be amortized over the period of cost reduction 
purchase price aggregating million was recorded as notes receivable and is included in other current or long term assets  depending on maturity  and will be repaid over periods ranging from three years to five years 
in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
the offering consisted of  shares of common stock sold by us at per share for net proceeds  after underwriters commissions and other costs  of million  and  shares sold by certain of our stockholders 
in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
all of these shares were sold by certain of our stockholders and we did not receive any of the net proceeds 
we incurred costs of million related to this offering  which were recorded as a reduction in our additional paid in capital 
in june  we redeemed all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes for million  including a redemption premium of million 
we funded the redemption with the net proceeds from our february sale of common stock and existing cash 
as a result of the redemption  we recorded a charge of million  including the redemption premium and unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discounts 
prior to the redemption  we had received the consents necessary under our credit agreement to use the proceeds from the sale of shares by us and cash on hand to redeem the notes 
on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
the shares may be repurchased at times and prices as determined by management and may be completed through open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase program provides that repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable state and federal law and in accordance with the terms and subject to the restrictions of rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
shares will be retired and cancelled upon repurchase 
we obtained an amendment to our credit agreement permitting the stock repurchase program 
through december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for an aggregate total cost of approximately million 
performance improvement program in  we completed a company wide performance improvement program with the objective of increasing revenues and reducing both costs of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues beginning in we retained the services of alixpartners  llc  a consulting firm specializing in corporate performance enhancement  to assist with the performance improvement program 
with the objective of reducing costs by streamlining our organization structure  our performance improvement program included the elimination of several senior management and other positions 
we also moved the manufacturing of all our remaining soft goods and certain non custom rigid braces manufactured in the united states to our manufacturing facilities in mexico 
other focuses of the performance improvement program included reducing operating expenses  improving the profitability of sales to our third party payor customers  improving working capital management  and improving our business processes and information systems 
we also refocused our resources on our core rehabilitation business and discontinued the marketing of our surgical products and our knee replacement product in segments our reportable segments  except for regeneration  reflect our primary distribution channels 
regeneration is considered a reportable segment because of management s separate focus on its growth and profitability 
our reportable segments are as follows donjoy  which is responsible for sales of rigid knee braces  pain management products  regeneration products effective august and certain soft goods 
the channel consists of approximately independent commissioned sales representatives who are employed by approximately independent sales agents and a few of our direct sales representatives 
our sales representatives are primarily dedicated to the sale of our products to orthopedic surgeons  podiatrists  orthopedic and prosthetic centers  hospitals  surgery centers  physical therapists  athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals 
because the donjoy product lines generally require customer education on the application and use of the product  our sales representatives are technical specialists who receive extensive training both from us and the agent and use their expertise to help fit the patient with the product and assist the orthopedic professional in choosing the appropriate product to meet the patient s needs 
after a product order is received by a sales representative  we generally ship the product directly to the orthopedic professional and pay a sales commission to the agent based on sales of such products 
these commissions are reflected in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income  procare  in which products are sold by approximately direct and independent representatives that manage over dealers focused on primary and acute facilities 
products are sold primarily to national third party distributors  other regional medical supply dealers and medical product buying groups  generally at a discount from list prices 
the majority of these products are soft goods and pain management products requiring little or no patient education 
these distributors resell these products to large hospital chains  hospital buying groups  primary care networks and orthopedic physicians for use by the patients  regeneration  in which our ol product is sold through a combination of our donjoy segment direct sales representatives and approximately sales representatives dedicated to selling our ol product  of which approximately are employed by us 
the spinalogic product is also included in this segment and was  until the end of  sold by depuy spine in the us under an exclusive sales agreement 
in january  we amended the agreement with depuy to divide the us into territories in which depuy spine has exclusive sales rights and non exclusive territories in which we are permitted to engage in our own sales efforts or retain another sales agent 
these products are sold either directly to the patient or to independent distributors 
we arrange billing to the third party payors or patients  for products sold directly to the patient  officecare  in which we maintain an inventory of product mostly soft goods on hand at orthopedic practices for immediate distribution to the patient 
for these products  we arrange billing to the patient or third party payor after the product is provided to the patient 
we outsource most officecare billing and collections activities to an independent third party contractor 
the officecare program is also intended to facilitate the introduction of our products to orthopedic surgeons who had not previously been our customers 
as of december   the officecare program was located at over physician offices throughout the united states 
we have contracts with over third party payors for our officecare products  and international  in which our products are sold in foreign countries through wholly owned subsidiaries or independent distributors 
we sell our products in over foreign countries  primarily in europe  canada  australia and japan 
set forth below is net revenue  gross profit and operating income loss information for our reporting segments for the years ended december in thousands 
this information excludes the impact of other expenses not allocated to segments  which are comprised of i general corporate expenses for all periods presented  ii the impairment of long lived assets and certain performance improvement  restructuring  and other costs for and iii the restructuring costs associated with the manufacturing move in information for the regeneration segment includes operations for the period subsequent to the regeneration acquisition on november  and includes the impact of purchase accounting and related amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for the years ended december  and  regeneration income from operations was reduced by amortization of acquired intangible assets amounting to million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   regeneration income from operations was also reduced by restructuring charges of million related to the integration of the business operations of the segment

international international sales accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues  in  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth our international net revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues  by country for the years ended december germany canada australia other countries total international sales the other countries category consists primarily of sales in italy  belgium  the united kingdom  the czech republic  denmark  france  japan and spain 
international sales are made primarily through two distinct channels independent third party distributors and through our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
through our wholly owned international subsidiaries  we sell products in euros  pounds sterling  canadian dollars and danish krones 
the us dollar equivalent of our international sales denominated in foreign currencies in  and were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries 
the us dollar equivalent of the related costs denominated in these foreign currencies were unfavorably impacted during the same period 
in addition  the costs associated with our mexico based manufacturing operations are incurred in mexican pesos 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results 
occasionally we seek to reduce the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our business through hedging transactions 
at december   we had no hedging transactions in place 
our strategy our strategy is to increase revenue and profitability and enhance cash flow by strengthening our market leadership position 
our key initiatives to implement this strategy include grow our regeneration business 
we have integrated the sales force for our ol regeneration product into our domestic rehabilitation sales organization  which will provide an increased number of bgs specialists who we believe will be able to use the established relationships of our donjoy sales representatives to enhance sales of the ol product 
we have also restructured our distribution arrangement with depuy spine to permit us to sell the spinalogic product directly or through other independent sales representatives in those geographical parts of the country where sales are not meeting our expectations 
we believe that this focus on regeneration products will drive faster growth for this business 
further penetrate our existing customer base 
we are focused on increasing the number and variety of products sold to our existing customers 
we believe that our officecare program provides us with a strong platform for selling additional products to our existing customers because of the amount of contact our sales representatives have with the orthopedic practices who participate in the program 
we also believe that the addition of the bgs products to our existing product lines will further this goal by providing significant cross selling opportunities 
continue to introduce new products and product enhancements 
we have a history of developing and introducing innovative products into the marketplace  and are committed to continuing that tradition by introducing new products across our product platform 
in the year ended december   we launched new products 
we believe that product innovation through effective and focused research and development will provide a sustainable competitive advantage 
we believe we are currently a technology leader in several product categories and we intend to continue to develop next generation technologies 
expand our officecare channel 
our officecare channel currently includes over physician offices encompassing over  physicians 
we believe that our officecare channel serves a growing need among orthopedic practices to have a number of products readily available for immediate distribution to patients and represents an opportunity for sales growth 
we intend to expand our officecare channel into more high volume orthopedic offices  thereby increasing the number of potential customers to whom we sell our products 
in the year ended december   we added approximately net new offices to our officecare channel 
maximize existing and secure additional national accounts 
we plan to capitalize on the growing practice in healthcare in which hospitals and other large healthcare providers seek to consolidate their purchasing activities to national buying groups 
contracts with these national accounts represent a significant opportunity for sales growth 
we believe that our broad range of products are well suited to the goals of these buying groups and intend to aggressively pursue these contracts 
expand product offerings for the spine 
our spinalogic product is used as an adjunct therapy following spinal fusion surgery 
spinalogic was our first product that targeted the spine market 
according to frost sullivan  back pain is the number one cause of healthcare expenditure in the united states 
as a result  we believe that expanding our product offerings in this market represents a significant growth opportunity 
in  we launched a new compression back brace to address the spine market 
pursue selective strategic acquisitions 
we believe that strategic acquisitions represent an attractive and efficient means to broaden our product lines and increase our revenue 
the bgs products acquired in the regeneration acquisition  for example  which generated revenues of million during the twelve months ended december   enabled us to enter the regeneration market  which is predicted to grow faster than the rehabilitation market 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities that enhance sales growth  are accretive to earnings  increase customer penetration and or provide geographic diversity 
in particular  we intend to focus on international opportunities that will open new markets or offer new products 
expand international sales 
international sales have historically represented less than of our revenues 
although our presence outside the united states has been limited  we have successfully established direct distribution capabilities in major international markets 
on august   we acquired the outstanding stock of kd innovation a s  our independent distributor in denmark 
the acquired company  renamed dj orthopedics nordic aps  has direct responsibility for sales  marketing and distribution of our products in denmark  finland  norway and sweden 
we believe that sales to foreign markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we intend to continue to develop direct distribution capabilities in selected foreign markets 
expand low cost manufacturing capabilities 
we plan to continue to expand our low cost manufacturing capabilities in mexico to reduce our costs of goods sold and improve our gross margins 
at the end of we moved the manufacturing of our off the shelf rigid knee braces and the remaining manufacturing of our soft goods products from vista  california to tijuana  mexico  resulting in a significant reduction in our costs of goods sold 
this improved our gross margins beginning in in august  we completed construction of a new  square foot leased facility in tijuana  mexico  to replace three separate facilities we operated in the same area and to provide further opportunities to expand our mexico manufacturing operations 
as of october  all of our existing mexico facilities had been moved to this new facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the relocation of the manufacturing of our cold therapy products and machine shop activities from vista  california to the new mexico plant 
we recorded restructuring charges of million million net of tax in related to these manufacturing moves  including primarily severance and moving costs 
we also intend to use our expanded mexico facilities in the future to vertically integrate the manufacturing of certain components we purchase and further reduce our costs of goods sold 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to contractual allowances  doubtful accounts  inventories  rebates  product returns  warranty obligations  income taxes  intangibles and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provision for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
we maintain provisions for contractual allowances for reimbursement amounts from our third party payor customers based on negotiated contracts and historical experience for non contracted payors 
we also maintain provisions for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have contracts with certain third party payors for our third party reimbursement billings  which call for specified reductions in reimbursement of billed amounts based upon contractual reimbursement rates 
for  we reserved for and reduced gross revenues from third party payors by between and for allowances related to these contractual reductions  which is higher than our historical rates of to of gross billed charges to third party payors 
our contractual allowances percentages increased in following increases in our current gross price levels 
for our regeneration business  we record revenue net of actual contractual allowances and discounts from our gross prices  which are determined on a specific identification basis and amount to approximately to of our gross prices for bone growth stimulation products 
our reserve for doubtful accounts is based upon estimated losses from customers who are billed directly and the portion of third party reimbursement billings that ultimately become the financial responsibility of the end user patients 
direct billed customers represent approximately of our net accounts receivable at december  and we have historically experienced write offs of less than of these accounts receivable 
our third party reimbursement customers include all of the customers of our officecare business segment  the majority of our regeneration business segment and certain third party payor customers of our donjoy business segment  including insurance companies  managed care companies and certain governmental payors such as medicare 
our third party payor customers represented approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  and of our net accounts receivable at december  and we estimate bad debt expense to be approximately to of gross revenues from these third party reimbursement customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if third party payors were to deny claims for late filings  incomplete information or other reasons  additional provisions may be required 
historically  we relied heavily on third party billing service providers to provide information about the accounts receivable of our third party payor customers  including the data utilized to determine reserves for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
during  we enhanced the ability of our systems to obtain and analyze the information processed by these billing service providers 
our increased ability to obtain and better analyze information beginning in revealed that  as a result of historical third party billing problems  we had experienced an increase in allowances and bad debts for accounts receivable from our third party payor customers and we increased our provisions for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts accordingly in in march  we completed the transition to a new third party insurance billing service provider 
we continue to enhance our ability to analyze historical information  resolve issues related to our accounts receivable  and reduce our aging 
based on information currently available to us  we believe we have provided adequate reserves for our third party payor accounts receivable 
if claims are denied  or amounts are otherwise not paid  in excess of our estimates  the recoverability of our net accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount 
in addition  if our third party insurance billing service provider does not perform to our expectations we may be required to increase our reserve estimates 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
we provide reserves for estimated excess or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories on hand plus future purchase commitments and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
if future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  reserves for inventories on hand in our officecare locations are provided based on historical shrinkage rates of approximately 
if actual shrinkage rates differ from our estimated shrinkage rates  revisions to the reserve may be required 
we also provide reserves for newer product inventories  as appropriate  based on any minimum purchase commitments and our level of sales of the new products 
during the year ended december   we disposed of gross inventories aggregating million which had been fully reserved for in a previous year 
rebates 
we offer certain of our distributors rebates based on sales volume  sales growth and to reimburse the distributor for certain discounts 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebate programs based upon historical experience and estimated revenue levels 
returns and warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of returns and product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on historical trends 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our actual returns and warranty costs could differ from our estimates 
if actual product returns  failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated return and or warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset 
as of december   we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related primarily to tax deductible goodwill arising at the date of our reorganization in and not recognized for book purposes and net losses reported during realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards 
our management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted future taxable income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess any need for valuation allowances 
goodwill and other intangibles 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased amortization of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual review for impairment 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the segment or reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
at october   our goodwill was evaluated for impairment and we determined that no impairment existed at that date 
with the exception of goodwill related to our regeneration acquisition of million  we believe that the goodwill acquired through december  benefits the entire enterprise and since our reporting units share the majority of our assets  we compared the total carrying value of our consolidated net assets including goodwill to the fair value of the company 
with respect to goodwill related to our regeneration acquisition  we compared the carrying value of the goodwill related to the regeneration segment to the fair value of the regeneration segment 
at december   other intangibles were evaluated for impairment as required by sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the determination of the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the exercise of judgment 
upon initially recording certain of our other intangible assets  including the intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the regeneration acquisition  we used independent valuation firms to assist us in determining the appropriate values for these assets 
subsequently  we have used the same methodology and updated our assumptions 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily used the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry averages 
we recorded an impairment charge for certain long lived assets in as a result of certain new products not achieving anticipated revenues and estimated recovery values of assets being disposed of being less than anticipated 
the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets is exposed to future impairments if we experience future declines in operating results  if negative industry or economic trends occur or if our future performance is below our projections or estimates 
results of operations we operate our business on a manufacturing calendar  with our fiscal year always ending on december each quarter is weeks  consisting of one five week and two four week periods 
the first and fourth quarters may have more or less working days from year to year based on the days of the week on which holidays and december fall 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  regeneration segment amounts in the tables below include operations for the period subsequent to the regeneration acquisition on november  and include the impact of the regeneration purchase accounting and related amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for the years ended december  and  regeneration income from operations was reduced by amortization of acquired intangible assets amounting to million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   regeneration income from operations was also reduced by restructuring charges related to the integration of the business operations of the segment of million 
net revenues 
set forth below are net revenues for our reporting segments in thousands years ended pro forma year ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase december  of net revenues donjoy procare regeneration officecare international consolidated net revenues net revenues in our donjoy segment increased primarily due to the implementation of sales productivity initiatives  increased sales of rigid knee braces into school athletic programs and sales of new products 
these increases were partially offset by a negative impact from recent changes in the california workers compensation system and reduced sales of certain of our pain management products 
net revenues in our procare segment increased due to growth in sales related to national contracts 
on a pro forma basis  net revenue in our regeneration segment increased due to increased sales volumes  offset by a negative impact in the third quarter of caused by disruption from the integration of our regeneration sales organization into our donjoy sales organization 
revenues in our regeneration segment were also impacted during the third quarter of by a decline in sales of our spinalogic product  which we believe was due partly to slow market conditions and partly to weak sales performance in certain territories 
net revenues in our officecare segment increased due partly to the net addition of approximately net new officecare locations and price increases implemented in mid  offset by price reductions in our fracture boot products due to a change in the medicare reimbursement code 
international revenues increased due partly to favorable changes in exchange rates compared to the rates in effect in excluding the impact of exchange rates  local currency international revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to the launch of new products and the addition of our new direct sales subsidiary in the nordic countries  effective september  gross profit 
set forth below is gross profit information for our reporting segments in thousands years ended pro forma year ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase decrease increase decrease december  of net revenues donjoy procare regeneration officecare international consolidated gross profit the improvement in consolidated gross profit and gross profit margin is primarily related to the favorable impact of higher gross margins associated with the products sold in our regeneration segment  continued manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and a reduction in expenses associated with employee bonuses  partially offset by increased freight costs 
gross profit increased in the donjoy segment primarily due to a favorable product mix  including increased sales in our donjoy insurance channel  which carry a higher gross margin than sales in our donjoy direct channel 
procare gross profit decreased due to increased sales through our national contracts  which carry lower gross margins 
on a pro forma basis and excluding the impact of one time purchase accounting adjustments  regeneration gross profit increased as a percentage of revenues due to reduced cost of goods sold for these products and a higher mix of insurance sales  which have higher average selling prices and therefore generate higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers 
officecare gross profit increased primarily due to certain price increases implemented in mid in this segment offset by price reductions due to a change in the medicare reimbursement code for certain fracture boot products 
the increase in the international gross profit is primarily related to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates and the addition of the incremental in market gross margin on our direct sales in the nordic countries since september  operating expenses 
set forth below is operating expense information in thousands years ended pro forma year ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase december  of net revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of acquired intangibles restructuring costs consolidated operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributed to million of expenses related to the regeneration segment 
in addition  selling and marketing expenses increased due to costs associated with increased commissions on increased sales  additional sales personnel  increased advertising and marketing programs and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes 
these increases were offset by a reduction in expenses associated with employee bonuses 
our international segment also incurred increased expenses in related to our new subsidiaries in france and denmark  added in september and september  respectively  and a bi annual trade exhibition in europe 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to million of expenses related to the regeneration segment  increased professional fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  and legal costs  including the settlement of a contract dispute  offset by a reduction in expenses associated with employee bonuses 
general and administrative expenses also increased in our officecare segment in related to increased efforts to maximize cash collections in this segment 
research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expense is attributed to million of expenses related to the regeneration segment and an increase in professional fees related to various patents and technology offset by a reduction in expenses associated with employee bonuses 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles relates to intangible assets acquired in connection with the regeneration acquisition  which are being amortized over lives ranging from months to years 
on a pro forma basis the amortization expense in the year ended december  is consistent with the year ended december  restructuring costs 
in  we recorded charges of million related to our regeneration integration and manufacturing moves  including charges for severance  recruiting  training and other related exit costs 
in the year ended december   we recorded a credit to restructuring costs of approximately million as a reversal of an accrual recorded in related to future rent to be paid for vacated facilities  as we decided to retain the vacant space for future expansion 
income from operations 
set forth below is income from operations information for our reporting segments in thousands years ended pro forma year ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase decrease increase decrease december  of net revenues donjoy procare regeneration officecare international income from operations of reportable segments expenses not allocated to segments consolidated income from operations the decrease in income from operations as a percentage of net revenue for the donjoy segment is primarily due to an increased investment in sales and marketing expense for personnel and programs 
the slight decrease in income from operations in the procare segment is due primarily to lower gross profit margins associated with revenue from national contracts 
the decrease in income from operations  on a pro forma basis  for the regeneration segment is primarily the result of restructuring charges of million in  partially offset by increased revenues and higher gross margins 
the increase in income from operations for the officecare segment is primarily the result of increased revenue and higher gross profit margins 
income from operations in the international segment was reduced from the prior year due primarily to the investment we made in the start up activities of our new direct sales subsidiaries in france and denmark  as well as the expenses associated with a bi annual european exhibition which occurred in the second quarter of interest expense  net of interest income and prepayment premium and other costs related to senior subordinated notes redemption 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease is due to the retirement of our former credit facility and the june redemption of our senior subordinated notes  offset by interest related to the incremental outstanding debt we incurred in connection with the regeneration acquisition

as part of our strategy  we may pursue additional acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances 
we may require new sources of financing to consummate any such transactions  including additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that such additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may not be able to consummate any such transactions due to the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit agreement 
the following table lists our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations represents scheduled principal payments for through under the term loan portion of our credit facility 
on october   we entered into a lease agreement with professional real estate services  inc pres under which pres will undertake to build a new  square foot corporate headquarters facility for us on vacant land currently leased to us in vista  california 
once completed  we will occupy the facility under a year lease with two five year options to extend the term and will move out of our existing facilities in vista 
rent for the new facility will be based on an agreed percentage of the total project cost for the construction of the facility and is not expected to exceed the rent currently paid by us for our existing vista facilities 
the contractual obligations table above includes only the rent for our current vista facilities as future rent payments to pres for the new facility cannot be determined as of december  the new lease with pres was contingent on pres closing a transaction to purchase the existing facilities in vista  california leased by us  as well as the real property underlying the new lease 
the purchase transaction closed in february effective on the closing date  our lease for the vacant land was terminated  and when the new headquarters facility is completed and occupied  our leases for our existing vista facilities will be terminated 
those leases would otherwise have continued until february upon occupancy of the new facility  expected to occur in mid  we will make a lump sum rent payment to pres  which will be recorded as operating expense when incurred  equal to of the rent that would have been due under the existing facilities leases from the termination date of the existing leases through the original expiration date 
if pres is able to lease our former vista facilities during what would have remained of the term of our existing leases  a portion of that sum may be refunded to us 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  fund working capital requirements and make anticipated capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds including the availability of borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and for working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in such event  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
we cannot assure you that any such funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
we do not currently have and have never had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
as of december   we had available a total of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under the revolving credit facility 
for  we expect to spend total cash of approximately million for the following requirements approximately million scheduled principal and interest payments on our credit facility  and approximately million for capital expenditures 
in addition  we expect to make other general corporate payments in seasonality we generally record our highest net revenues per day in the fourth quarter due to a greater number of orthopedic surgeries and injuries resulting from increased sports activity  particularly football and skiing 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  a patient has a greater likelihood of having satisfied his or her annual insurance deductible than in the first three quarters of the year  and thus there is an increase in the number of elective orthopedic surgeries 
we follow a manufacturing calendar that has a varied number of shipping days in each quarter 
although on a per day basis net revenues may be higher in a certain quarter  total net revenues may be higher or lower based upon the number of shipping days in such quarter 
conversely  we generally have lower net revenues per day during our second quarter as a result of decreased sports activity 
recent accounting pronouncements for information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
our primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with the term loan and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on the london inter bank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the underlying debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt represented by borrowings under our credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of at december  
based on the balance outstanding under the credit facility as of december   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate would have caused an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
at december   up to million of variable rate borrowings were available under our million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we did not have any amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility  but we were contingently liable for letters of credit issued under the facility aggregating million 
we may use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage our interest rate risks 
however  as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had no such derivative financial instruments outstanding 
through our wholly owned international subsidiaries  we sell products in euros  pounds sterling  canadian dollars and danish krones 
the us dollar equivalent of our international sales denominated in foreign currencies in  and were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries 
the us dollar equivalent of the related costs denominated in these foreign currencies were unfavorably impacted during the same period 
in addition  the costs associated with our mexico based manufacturing operations are incurred in mexican pesos 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results 
occasionally we seek to reduce the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our business through hedging transactions 
at december   we had no hedging transactions in place
