item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  about the markets in which we operate and our business and prospects  including statements about our revenuess  gross margin  operating expenses  the sufficiency of our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents  our short term investments and our bank lines of credit to meet our working capital requirements  and the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our short term investments  our bank lines of credit and our foreign currency cash balances 
these statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties which may result in different or disappointing future business and financial results 
many of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in this report  including under certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial conditions 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   our net revenues increased to million from million reported for fiscal this slight increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the increased non recurring engineering revenues and sales of our new em windows media media processors in the ip video application and advanced dvd media player markets which was partially offset by the decreased sales of other mpeg chipset products in the same markets 
revenues from sales of our products in ip video application and advanced dvd media player market increased to of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of total revenues for fiscal and for fiscal  while revenues from sales of our products in the pc add in market decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million  increased by million as compared to net income of million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues of million  gross margin of million  an incentive of million received from the french tax authorities  and interest income of million from our short term investments  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
the incentive recovered qualifying research and development expenditures incurred by our french subsidiary in fiscal the following table shows certain items as a percentage of net revenues  which are included in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal fiscal fiscal net revenues cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative other income expense net income loss available to common shareholders net revenues the following table sets forth our net revenues in each of our major product group  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each product group  for the last three years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal boards chipsets other total net revenues our board level product lines target oem customers to address the dvd upgrade market  system integrators to address the computer based training  kiosks  and corporate video on demand markets and consumer markets for upgraded multimedia products 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume oem customers building interactive multimedia products for business and consumer markets 
the other category includes netstream consoles for the ip video application market  development kits  set top box products and accessories  service revenues under agreements for providing hardware and software support  engineering development for customization of certain mpeg decoding chipsets and freight fees charged to customers 
the costs related to support service revenues and development revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses  respectively 
we anticipated the continuous decrease in revenues for our mpeg board products from fiscal through  which were mainly attributable to our decision to focus on the chipset products in the ip video application and advanced dvd media player market instead of board products in the same markets 
the increases in revenues for our chipset products from fiscal through fiscal were attributable to the continuing growth of demand for our chipset products from the ip video application and advance dvd media player markets  leading to increased unit sales and higher introduction selling prices of our new advanced dvd player and ip video set top box chipsets 
the table below sets forth our net revenues by market and the percentage of total net revenues represented by our product sales to each market segment for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal ip video application market advanced dvd media player market hdtv product market pc add in and other markets total net revenues for fiscal  revenues from sales of our products to the ip video application market increased or  from fiscal and increased or  for fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  revenues from sales of our products to the advanced dvd media player market decreased or  from fiscal and increased or  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues in the ip video application market for fiscal as compared to fiscal and is mainly attributable to increased unit sales due to the increase in internet protocol television iptv and digital media adapter dma deployment 
we expect our revenues from the ip video application market to fluctuate in future periods due to the uneven pace of iptv service deployments 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to the advanced dvd media player market for fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to decreased unit sales and lower average selling price of our mpeg chipsets to advanced dvd player manufacturers  partially offset by increased revenues from sales of our new window media video wmv chipsets 
the increase in revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to increased sales of our mpeg chipset products 
we expect revenues from sales of our products to the advanced dvd media player market will continue to fluctuate  primarily due to changes in demand from our customers 
if  however  these declines in unit sales and average selling prices for our products sold into the advanced dvd media player market were to continue  it could harm our revenues and profitability 
we began shipment of hdtv applications during the second quarter of fiscal  and expect revenues in the hdtv product market to increase slowly over the near term 
the category pc add in and other markets in the above table consists of pc add in board and chipset products  engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets  and freight fees 
the continued decrease in revenues for fiscal and is due to the decreased unit sales of our chipsets to the pc add in market  partially offset by increased revenues in engineering development projects 
we expect our revenues from sales for these products to the pc add in markets to continue to decrease due to the generally declining demand  and we expect our revenues from engineering development projects to fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and complexity of the projects required by our customers 
the table below sets forth our net revenues by geographic region  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each geographic region  for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal asia europe united states canada other regions total net revenues our asia revenues for fiscal were derived predominantly from customers in china  taiwan  and korea 
revenues generated from china  taiwan  and korea  in fiscal accounted for  and of our total net revenues  respectively as compared to   and for fiscal and  and for fiscal our europe revenues in fiscal were derived predominantly from customers in denmark 
revenues generated from denmark in fiscal accounted for of our total net revenues  as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal in fiscal no domestic customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues  one customer in asia accounted for of our total net revenues and one customer in europe accounted for of our total net revenues 
in fiscal  no customer accounted more than of our total net revenues and one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal our international revenues were at the same percentage as fiscal  approximately of our total net revenues 
the percentage of international sales was in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues  due in part to the significant overseas manufacturing of consumer appliances by our chipset customers 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately in fiscal year  in fiscal  and in fiscal this improvement was due to our continuing efforts to reduce the cost of our original mpeg board and chipset products  and the introduction and sales of our new higher margin chipset and board products as well as increased service and development revenues 
in addition  the costs related to service revenues and development revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses respectively see reference to critical accounting policies revenue recognition  while our expense for inventory obsolescence included in cost of revenues decreased to million versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of product sales  selling prices  including as affected by volume discounts  our costs  the extent of development fees  and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
because average selling prices of our products typically decline over the life of a product  if we are unable to reduce costs faster than the rate of such decline or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our gross margins will decline 
operating expenses in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were comparable to fiscal and increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods as we intend to increase headcount in our sales and marketing organization and to expand our product marketing and sales development 
research and development expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the additions of engineering staff at our headquarters  our hong kong office and development center in france  independent contractors and consultants  prototype costs of new products  and various licensing fees 
we plan to continue our efforts in the development of our proprietary mpeg and wmv based products  and expect research and development expenses will likely increase by to in absolute dollar terms on a year over year basis at least for the near term 
our general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal year  due to additional expenses for various professional services most of which are sarbanes oxley related  totaling approximately million 
the increase is also due to additional bad debt expense of million compared to a million recovery in and legal costs that were million greater than prior year 
our general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was mainly due to a million recovery of bad debt expenses and the reduction of professional service fees 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods due to the continually increasing cost of insurance  professional services and other expenditures associated with our business 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million  a slight decrease of million compared with million at january  the decrease resulted from an additional million investment in an original equipment manufacturer the oem headquartered in europe  a million investment in a local early stage technology company and capital equipment additions of million 
the decrease was partially offset by cash generated from operations of million and million from the exercise and purchase of stock by employees through the stock options plan and the employee stock purchase program 
our ownership interest in the oem is less than as of january  and less than as of january  and is accounted for using the cost method 
we had revenues from product sales to this oem of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
we had an accounts receivable balance of million and million from this oem at january  and  respectively 
subsequent to january   payment terms for the million receivable balance from this oem were modified to provide for an extended repayment arrangement of eight weekly installment payments ranging from  to  commencing march  through may  the modified payment terms were in response to cash flow difficulties the oem encountered subsequent to its product purchases from us  primarily because of operational issues that arose when the oem transferred the manufacturing of its products to another contract manufacturer 
to extend its payment terms  the oem provided to us a security interest on certain of its assets 
as of april  the oem was ahead of schedule with respect to the modified payment terms and  as a result  the remaining balance of this receivable had been reduced to approximately million which we believe is fully collectable 
we do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments for any of our suppliers 
the following table sets forth the amounts in thousands of payments due under specified contractual obligations  which consisted solely of operating lease commitments  as of january  contractual obligations operating payments due by period leases year or less years  total  on october   we entered into an amended and restated revolving line of credit  expiring in october  which is primarily collateralized by our accounts receivable and under which we can draw down a maximum of million 
as of january   we had availability to draw down approximately million 
in addition  we have a bank line of credit of million that expires in october  which line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the entire million of bank line is available for borrowing 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under either line of credit 
under the agreements for these lines of credit  we are subject to certain financial covenants 
as of january   we were in compliance with these covenants 
our primary sources of funds to date have been proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  and borrowings under bank lines of credit 
in certain periods  cash generated from operations has also been a source of funds 
while we generated cash from operations for the year ended january  and  it is possible that our operations will consume cash in future periods 
other than the obligations under certain contractual agreements shown on the table above  we currently have no long term debt 
based on our currently anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents  including the proceeds from our private placements of common stock during the first half of fiscal  will be sufficient to meet our primary uses of cash  which include our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments  and other cash needs for the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will be able to comply with or make modifications to the current covenants under our existing asset based banking agreements  and to renew those lines of credit upon their expiration  in order to maintain the availability of funds under these agreements 
certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial condition you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing sigma designs 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our business is highly dependent on the expansion of young and rapidly evolving segments of the consumer electronics market our business is highly dependent on the sale of ip video set top boxes  advanced dvd media players  and high definition televisions 
we expect the majority of our current revenues to come from the sale of chipsets for use in emerging consumer applications 
the digital home entertainment market will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our ability to sustain and increase revenues is in large part dependent on the continued growth of these young and rapidly evolving market segments  whose future is largely uncertain 
many factors could impede or interfere with the expansion of these consumer market segments  including general economic conditions  other competing consumer electronic products  delays in the deployment of telecommunications video services and insufficient interest in new technology innovations 
in addition  even if these consumer market segments expand  manufacturers of products in these segments may not choose to utilize our products in their products  but rather the products of our competitors 
moreover  market acceptance of the products of manufacturers that do utilize our products may not occur as expected 
in any such case  our business would likely be harmed 
we have a history of operating losses and we could sustain future losses 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable and if we continue to lose money  our business may not be financially viable 
we incurred significant operating losses in fiscal     and and had negative cash flow in fiscal   and since our introduction of the realmagic mpeg product line in november  we have made significant investments in marketing and technological innovation for our realmagic products 
as a result of our investments  we experienced significant losses through fiscal fiscal  and also included significant losses associated with products other than those related to our realmagic technology 
fiscal  and included significant losses associated with a decline in demand for our realmagic products 
since our inception through january   our total accumulated deficit is million 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur operating losses in any future fiscal quarter or fiscal year 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors and any of these factors could adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by us and our competitors  changes in our pricing models and product sales mix  unexpected reductions in unit sales  average selling prices and or gross margins  particularly if they occur precipitously  expenses related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  market acceptance of the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular  the level of acceptance of our products by our oem customers  and acceptance of our oem customers products by their end user customers  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular and those of our competitors  gains or losses of significant customers  the timing of  and potential unexpected delays in our customer orders and product shipments  reduction in average selling prices and gross margins  which could occur either gradually or precipitously  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials included in our products  for example  our source of supply for silicon wafers was  and may in the future be  affected by earthquakes in taiwan  our inability to protect our intellectual property  loss of key personnel  technical problems in the development  ramp up  and manufacturing of products which could cause shipping delays  the effect of terrorist attacks and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide  availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain products  the impact of a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  upon our revenues and our supply sources for our products  and the impact of potential economic instability in the asia pacific region 
our industry is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete 
if we fail to compete effectively  our growth could be substantially affected 
the market for multimedia products is highly competitive and includes embedded processors provided by multiple companies 
processors have  in recent years  included increased graphics functionality 
other companies with more experience and financial resources may develop a competitive product that could inhibit future growth in sales of products utilizing our realmagic technology 
increased competition may be generated from several major computer product manufacturers that have developed products and technologies that could compete directly with realmagic products 
these competitors include analog devices  ati technologies  broadcom  cirrus logic  conexant systems  equator technologies  ess technology  lsi logic c cube  mediatek  phillips  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments  and zoran corporation 
in addition  for some applications  video decoding is done in software operating on today s more powerful cpus 
most of our competitors have substantial experience and expertise in audio  video and multimedia technology and in producing and selling consumer products through retail distribution and oem channels 
these companies also have substantially greater engineering  marketing and financial resources than we have 
our competitors could form cooperative relationships that could present formidable competition to us 
we cannot assure you that our realmagic technology will continue to achieve commercial success or that it will compete effectively against other interactive multimedia products  services and technologies that currently exist  are under development  or may be announced by competitors 
also  we anticipate that our competitors will  over time  introduce features that have been unique to sigma designs  such as wmv decoding 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose market share or suffer price erosion in each of our market segments  as a result of the introduction of competitive products with similar features 
the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act will increase our operating expenses  and our receipt of an adverse opinion on internal controls from our external auditor could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to include an internal controls report of management s assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our annual report on form k beginning with the fiscal year ended january  our independent auditors are required to attest to  and report on  our management s assessment 
in our report  our management documents both the design of our internal controls and the testing processes supporting management s evaluation and conclusion 
we extensively documented and tested our internal controls over financial reporting in order to meet our required compliance date of january  we hired additional personnel and engaged outside advisory services all of which caused our operating expenses to increase 
we expect to incur additional expenses in the future in connection with compliance with sarbanes oxley in future periods 
in addition  deficiencies and weaknesses identified by the company and our independent auditors are required to be remediated and this will likely result in additional expenses 
these include material weaknesses which resulted in an adverse opinion on our internal controls  including the following inadequate controls to ensure that financial information is adequately analyzed to detect misstatements  the lack of understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and sec reporting matters  and inadequate supervision and review controls over the recording of stock options 
we are evaluating the additional steps and actions needed to improve our financial infrastructure and eliminate the deficiencies and weaknesses identified and will take appropriate remedial action 
we believe that the internal control deficiencies and material weaknesses identified to date did not have a material effect on our financial statements for the period ended january  however the receipt of the adverse opinion from our independent auditors over internal controls could detrimentally impact our stock price 
sales risks and volatility of oem customer sales and resale distribution may harm our business 
our ability to increase sales and achieve continued profitability depends substantially on our ability to achieve a sustained high level of sales to our oem customers 
we have not executed volume purchase agreements with any of our current customers 
our customers are not under any obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of our products 
also  even if we achieve new design wins  we cannot assure you that these manufacturers will purchase our products in substantial volumes 
sales to any particular oem customer fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and are subject to severe price pressures by competitors 
any reductions in those sales could seriously harm our business 
based on our experience in the industry  we expect that our actual sales to oem customers will continue to experience significant fluctuations 
also  estimates of future sales to any particular customer or groups of customers are inherently uncertain 
because we depend on a limited number of major customers  the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers may adversely affect our business 
in fiscal  no domestic customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues  however  one customer in asia accounted for and one customer in europe accounted for of our total net revenues 
in fiscal  no customer accounted more than of our total net revenues and only one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal our dependence on a few major customers will likely continue despite other changes in the composition of our customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellations of orders from major customers or the loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collection from key customers could harm our business 
our international operations are subject to certain risks 
our international sales represented of total net revenues for the years ended january  and  and for the year ended january  we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to constitute a substantial percentage of our net revenues 
also  one of the foundries that manufacture our products and components is located in asia 
due to the concentration of international sales and the manufacturing capacity in europe and asia  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally 
these risks include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and fluctuations in the us dollar that could increase the sales price in local currencies of our products in international markets  or make it difficult for us to obtain price reductions from our foundries 
overseas sales and purchases to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce our exposure to exchange rate risks 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to the asia pacific region 
this region of the world is subject to increased levels of economic instability  and this instability could seriously harm our results of operations 
further  the economic impact of a recurrence of sars or a similar event in this region could adversely affect our revenues and our business as a whole 
the timing of our customer orders and product shipments can adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
our quarterly revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenues during each quarter  each of which is extremely difficult to forecast 
the majority of our orders in a given quarter historically have been shipped in the last months of that quarter 
this trend is likely to continue  and any failure or delay in the closing of orders during the last part of a quarter would adversely affect our operating results 
further  to the extent we receive orders late in any given quarter  we may be unable to ship products to fill those orders during the same quarter in which we received the corresponding order  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results for that quarter 
our products are subject to increasing price pressures 
some of our markets  especially the dvd segments  are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of customers to design our chips into their products depends to a significant extent  upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
we expect the average selling price of our existing products to decline significantly over the life of each product as the markets for our products mature  new technologies emerge  and competition increases 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margin s in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
if we fail to comply with or obtain waivers for covenants under our loan obligations  our financial condition could be harmed 
we have two lines of credit with a bank  which allow for borrowings of million from each line 
under the agreements for these lines of credit  which expire in october  we are subject to certain financial covenants 
in the past  we had  on occasion  been in violation of some of the covenants and in all cases  obtained waivers releasing us from our obligation to meet these covenants as of previous dates 
it is possible that we may need such a waiver for future non compliance and we cannot assure you that our bank will grant these waivers 
if we do not meet these covenants and cannot obtain waivers  the lender could accelerate payments of any amounts due under the lines 
to the extent we had borrowed amounts under these lines and were required to repay them on an accelerated basis  it could substantially weaken our financial condition 
if we do not have sufficient funds available to make full payment of the lines when required  the bank could foreclose on our accounts receivable  inventories  general intangibles  equipment and tangible assets that collateralize the notes  which would harm our business 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under any line of credit 
our future revenues growth depends in large part on the adoption of mpeg technology and new codecs 
our business strategy is  and has been  to focus on our realmagic products by investing heavily in video decoding technology 
we have made substantial investments in product development based on the latest mpeg technology  wmv though wmv has gained some market acceptance  there is increasing competition from the iso h 
standard  a next generation video codec that forms an extension of mpeg though we intend to support new codec technologies as they become commercially viable  there is no guarantee that we can successfully develop these technologies in a timely manner or that competitors will not gain market share at our expense with these new technologies 
our failure to keep pace with technological change will seriously harm our business 
our success depends  among other things  on our ability to achieve and maintain technological leadership and to remain competitive in terms of price and product performance 
our technological leadership depends on our continued technological advancements  as well as research and development investments in the area of mpeg video and audio decoding 
these advancements include the following compatibility with emerging standards and multiple platforms  and improvements to our silicon architecture 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make these advancements to our technology 
even if we do make these advances  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve and maintain technological leadership 
any material failure by us or oems and software developers to develop or incorporate any required improvement could adversely affect the continued acceptance of our technology and the introduction and sale of future products based on our technology 
we cannot assure you that products or technologies developed by others will not render our technology and the products based on our technology obsolete 
to be competitive  we must anticipate the needs of the market and successfully develop and introduce innovative new products in a timely fashion 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design of our new products  have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields  or obtain significant purchase orders for these products 
the introduction of new products may adversely affect sales of existing products and contribute to fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our introduction of new products also requires that we carefully manage our inventory to avoid inventory surplus and obsolescence 
our failure to do so could adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  new products  as opposed to more mature products  typically have higher initial component costs 
these higher costs could result in downward pressures on our gross margins 
we face many risks because of our heavy reliance on certain manufacturers and suppliers that could harm our business and financial condition 
our products and components are presently manufactured entirely by outside suppliers or foundries 
we do not have long term contracts with these suppliers 
we conduct business with our suppliers on a written purchase order basis 
our reliance on independent suppliers subjects us to several risks 
these risks include the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in access to  certain process technologies  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
we obtain some of our components from a single source 
other delays or interruptions have not occurred to date  but any delay or interruption in the supply of any of the components required for the production of our realmagic silicon or our realmagic multimedia cards currently obtained from a single source  including delays resulting from a recurrence of sars  earthquakes or other business interruption s could have a material adverse impact on our sales of realmagic products  and on our business 
we must provide our suppliers with sufficient lead time to meet our forecasted manufacturing objectives 
any failure to properly forecast such quantities could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce realmagic products in sufficient quantities 
we cannot assure you that our forecasts regarding new product demand will be accurate  particularly because we sell our realmagic products on a purchase order basis 
manufacturing realmagic chipsets is a complex process  and we may experience short term difficulties in obtaining timely deliveries 
this could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
any such delay in delivering products in the future could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
also  should any of our major suppliers become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our key components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable additional suppliers 
this qualification process could take up to three months or longer and additional sources of supply may not be in a position to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis 
in the past  we have experienced production delays and other difficulties  and we could experience similar problems in the future 
in addition  product defects may occur and they may escape identification at the factory 
this could result in unanticipated costs  cancellations  deferrals of purchase orders  or costly recall of products from customer sites 
loss of key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
given the complexity of realmagic technology  we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing hardware and software development of realmagic products 
these engineers are required to refine the existing hardware system and application programming interface and to introduce enhancements in future applications 
despite incentives we provide  our current employees may not continue to work for us  and if additional personnel were required for our operations  we may not be able to obtain the services of additional personnel necessary for our growth 
we face risks related to intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we currently hold twenty seven patents covering the technology underlying the realmagic products 
we have filed certain patent applications and are in the process of preparing others 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents for which we have applied will be issued or that any issued patents will provide meaningful protection of our product innovations 
like other emerging multimedia companies  we rely primarily on trade secrets and technological know how in the conduct of our business 
we also rely  in part  on copyright law to protect our proprietary rights with respect to our realmagic technology 
we use measures such as confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
these methods of protecting our intellectual property may not be sufficient 
the electronics industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation  and we may not be successful in such development or in obtaining such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  patent disputes in the electronics industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we do not yet have a large portfolio of issued patents  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we will be required to expense options granted under our employee stock plan as compensation  and our net income and earnings per share could be significantly reduced and we may be forced to change our business practices to attract and retain employees 
historically  we have used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options provide an incentive to our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage valued employees to remain with us 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period commencing after june   with early adoption encouraged 
therefore  we are required to adopt sfas r in our third fiscal quarter of when such adoption is implemented  our net income and earnings per share will be negatively impacted 
as a result  we may decide to reduce the number of employees who receive stock options or grant fewer options to particular employees 
this could adversely affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and also could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 
our stock price is volatile 
the market for our common stock has been subject to significant volatility  which is expected to continue 
the following factors  among others  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock our announcement of the introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of the introduction of new products  and market conditions in the technology  entertainment and emerging growth company sectors 
the stock market has experienced  and is currently experiencing  volatility that particularly affects the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies  such as those in the electronics industry 
this volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  could decrease the price of our common stock 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  and inventories 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we derive revenues from three principal sources product sales  product development contracts and service contracts 
revenues from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as our shipping terms are fob shipping point  except that revenues are deferred when management cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectibility is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable generally upon resale by customers or sell through basis 
allowances for sales returns  price protection and warranty costs are recorded at the time that revenues are recognized 
in fiscal  we began recognizing revenues from our primary us distributor on a sell through basis 
this practice resulted from significant sales returns  which we accepted from the distributor outside of the terms of the distribution agreement 
under terms of a distribution agreement entered into with the distributor in fiscal  we granted the distributor the right of return and price protection  which allows the distributor to return any product  which is in the original packaging  for full credit up to days after the earlier of the agreement expiration or early termination 
the price protection provision allows the distributor to receive a credit for the difference between the original price and the reduced price of our products within their inventory 
although the returns are not frequent in nature  returns from this distributor cannot be reasonably estimated 
consequently  pursuant to the above policy  revenue from this distributor is recognized upon resale to the distributor s end customers 
revenues from product development agreements were recognized in fiscal  and when billed  earned  and collection was assured 
the company classifies all development costs related to such agreements as research and development expenses as the associated effort expended in providing development revenue is resident in the r d function 
development revenues were   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenues from service contracts consist of fees for providing engineering support services  which are recognized ratably over the contract term 
expenses related to support service revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses as the engineering support associated with service contract revenue is resident in the sales and marketing function 
support service revenues were   and  for fiscal   and respectively 
accounts receivable during industry downturns  certain of our customers have difficulty with their cash flows 
certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  may delay their payments by days beyond the original terms 
we review the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness they incur with us 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot reasonably estimate whether collectibility is assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding credit worthiness 
in fiscal  and  we recorded a provision reversal for bad debt allowance in the total amount of   and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories if the current industry recovery falls below our expectation or we make changes in our current product development plans 
we estimate inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessments of future product sales giving consideration for factors such as the cyclical nature of our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to see demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change adversely  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need further write down inventory 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements the company accounts for stock based compensation awards issued to employees using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recorded for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the company has not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas r  but it is expected that the new standard may result in significant stock based compensation expense 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by the company to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method as described below chosen for adopting sfas r 
sfas r will be effective for the company s fiscal quarter beginning august   and requires the use of the modified prospective application method 
under this method sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas in addition  companies may use the modified retrospective application method 
this method may be applied to all prior years for which the original sfas was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption 
if the modified retrospective application method is applied  financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original sfas in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  management does not believe the adoption of this statement will have any immediate material impact on the company 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance concerning when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
prior to the issuance of fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin now requires a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
in october the fasb elected to defer the effective date for applying the provisions of fin for interests held by public entities in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company currently has no financial instruments which meet these requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our million and million variable interest rate bank lines of credit  respectively 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased interest expense associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income loss and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
the hong kong dollar and euro are the financial currencies of our subsidiaries in hong kong and france  respectively 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar and euro 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
