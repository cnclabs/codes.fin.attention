general we own and operate restaurants  at the end of fiscal  located in california  oregon  colorado  arizona  texas and nevada and receive fees from one licensed restaurant in lahaina  maui 
each of our restaurants are operated either as a bj s restaurant brewery  a bj s restaurant brewhouse  or a bj s pizza grill restaurant 
our menu features our award winning  signature deep dish pizza  our own handcrafted beers as well as a wide selection of appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
we have ten bj s restaurant brewery restaurants that feature in house brewing facilities where our handcrafted beers are produced 
in calculating our comparable restaurant revenues  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been opened for eighteen periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues

total revenues for increased to million from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily the result of the opening of the following new locations provided additional revenues of million in when compared with location concept opening date cerritos  california restaurant brewhouse july san jose  california restaurant brewhouse october willowbrook  texas restaurant brewhouse january laguna hills  california restaurant brewery june summerlin  nevada restaurant brewhouse june fresno  california restaurant brewhouse july san bernardino  california restaurant brewhouse september folsom  california restaurant brewhouse october plano  texas restaurant brewhouse december an increase in our same restaurants revenues for the comparable week period of million or 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in customer counts  a menu price increase of approximately effective during may  and an additional increase of approximately effective during november and a soda and beer price increase of effective during may and october  respectively 
the above mentioned increases were partially offset by approximately million of revenues related to the revenue of our three pietro s restaurants on march  fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks for fiscal after adjusting for million of restaurant revenues contributed by the additional operating week  restaurant revenues would have increased by to million for fiscal on a week basis 
cost of sales 
cost of food  beverages and paper for our restaurants increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this decrease is a result of increased menu prices and our continuing efforts to monitor costs  especially in our texas market where we have reduced our purchase prices through improved vendor pricing due to increased volumes and new restaurants 
we provide our customers a large variety of menu items which are not dependent on a single group of commodities 
during  commodity prices for meat increased while dairy products decreased in comparison to we continue to work with our vendors to control food costs  however  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurants will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of  an increase of million or 
this increase was substantially due to the increase in total revenues for as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this slight increase is primarily due to the fact that new restaurants run higher labor for the first days after opening and we have restaurants as of january   which has not yet met the day threshold as compared to one restaurant in occupancy 
occupancy costs increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of  an increase of million or 
the increase reflects the seven additional restaurants we opened during  the increase in total revenues for  partially offset by the sale of our pietro s restaurants on march  as a percentage of revenues  occupancy costs decreased to in from in this decrease is primarily due to the fact that five out of the eleven restaurants opened the last two years were ground leases with monthly lease payments below our historical rent levels 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of  an increase of million or

general and administrative expenses increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this increase is primarily the result of increased bonus payments as we obtained our budgeted plan for fiscal  severance payments of  to three corporate employees and  related to sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of restaurant equipment  furniture  leasehold improvements and brewery equipment totaling million for the seven restaurants opened in and million for the four restaurants opened in  coupled with three restaurants opened over the last year that had ground leases resulting in higher leasehold improvement costs 
in addition  restaurant opening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings which were in progress 
restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of  an increase of million 
this increase is primarily due to opening costs related to seven restaurant openings in when compared to four restaurant openings in in addition  we incurred restaurant opening expense in both years for restaurants which were in progress of opening 
our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings  the size and concept of the restaurants being opened and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
furthermore  approximately  of the increase is related to the correction of our holiday rent accounting 
interest income  net 
net interest income  increased to  during the weeks ended january  from  during the week period of  an increase of  this increase is primarily due to the repayment of our related party debt and other long term debt at the beginning of other income  net 
net other income increased to  during the weeks ended january  from a net expense of  in the week period of  an increase of  the increase was primarily due to the  charge related to our meal rest periods settlement in offset by the  received in connection with another settlement  decreased license fee income from our interest in the bj s lahaina  maui  hawaii restaurant and the sale of our pietro s restaurants in which generated gaming income 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of  an increase of  the increase was primarily due to increased income before taxes of million offset by the reduction of our tax reserve and valuation allowance of  our effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  was compared to for the comparable week period of our effective rate decreased due to additional utilization of fica tip credits  and the reduction of our tax reserve and valuation allowance 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
total revenues for increased to million from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily the result of the opening of the following new locations provided additional revenues of million in when compared with location concept opening date westlake  california restaurant brewhouse august oxnard  california restaurant brewery september lewisville  texas restaurant brewhouse november cupertino  california restaurant brewhouse december clear lake  texas restaurant brewery january addison  texas restaurant brewhouse may cerritos  california restaurant brewhouse july san jose  california restaurant brewhouse october an increase in our same restaurants revenues for the comparable year of million or 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in customer counts  a menu price increase of approximately effective during may  an additional increase of approximately effective during november and the fact that the year ended january  had one additional day of revenues 
the above mentioned increases were partially offset by  of revenues related to the closure of our pietro s eugene  oregon restaurant on february   pietro s portland  oregon restaurant lombard street on december   and our bj s portland  oregon restaurant stark street on june  cost of sales 
cost of food  beverages and paper for our restaurants increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or

as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefits costs decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily a result of management directed productivity improvements at the restaurant level and the presence of more restaurants in tip credit states 
in tip credit states  which include texas  arizona and colorado  we are permitted to reduce hourly labor rates up to approximately per hour 
occupancy 
occupancy costs increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase reflects the four additional restaurants we opened in august  september  november and december and the four additional restaurants we opened in january  may  july and october  partially offset by the closure of our pietro s portland  oregon restaurant lombard street in december and our bj s portland  oregon restaurant stark street in june as a percentage of revenues  occupancy costs decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to the fact that four out of the eight restaurants opened during had ground leases with monthly lease payments below our historical rent levels 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses increased to in from in the increase was primarily due to the following i increased utility costs  ii increased repair and maintenance costs related to restaurants open for a number of years  iii increased supply costs related to the implementation of a management driven labor productivity program  and iv increased marketing costs related to new markets and the continuing promotion of existing markets 
operating expenses include restaurant level operating costs  the major components of which include marketing  repairs and maintenance  insurance  supplies  credit cards  and utilities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of  or 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to a increase in revenues versus an increase of in general and administrative costs as the expenditures for infrastructure were spread across higher sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of restaurant equipment  furniture  leasehold improvements and brewery equipment totaling million and million for the four restaurants opened in and the four restaurants opened in  respectively  coupled with four restaurants opened over the last year that had ground leases resulting in higher leasehold improvement costs 
restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of  the overall decrease was primarily due to management directed programs to enhance expense control and reduce new employee hiring costs 
additionally  includes costs of  related to our willowbrook  texas restaurant that opened in january  but were offset by  of costs incurred in related to our clear lake  texas restaurant that opened in january restaurant closing recovery expense 
during  our restaurant closure reserve was reduced by  of which  was utilized for property  equipment and lease payments in connection with the closure of our stark and lombard restaurants in oregon 
the remaining balance of  was recorded as a reduction in our restaurant closure expense primarily due to more favorable lease settlements than we anticipated 
at january   the balance of our reserve  which included  in current liabilities and  in long term liabilities  was for the lease liability related to our lombard restaurant and the remaining lease liability related to our mcminnville restaurant that was sold in interest income expense  net 
net interest income expense increased to  in from  in  an increase of  during  approximately million redeemable warrants and approximately  stock options were exercised  providing approximately million in cash proceeds to us  net of approximately  of related costs 
the overall increase in interest income  net is primarily due to a decrease in interest expense related to the payoff of our term loan in april with an outstanding balance of million offset by the decrease in interest income primarily due to i less cash to invest after the opening of our four new restaurants over the past year and ii decreased interest rates 
other expense income  net 
net other expense income decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily due to the  charge related to our meals rest periods settlement  offset by the  received in connection with another settlement and increased gaming income at our pietro s pizza locations 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million in from  in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to increased income before taxes of million 
additionally  our effective tax rate decreased from in to in as a result of higher utilization of our fica credits 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are principally related to restaurant growth plans 
similar to many restaurant chains  we utilize operating lease arrangements for substantially all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum rents and related fixed asset obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or credit cards  at the time of the sale  thus we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers of such items 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash during the weeks ended january   a million increase from the million generated during the week period of the increase in cash from operating activities for the weeks ended january   in comparison to weeks ended december   is primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors included in accounts payable  increased prepaids and other assets due to the timing of rent payments and increased net income  partially offset by the gain on sale of pietro s restaurants 
total capital expenditures for the acquisition of our restaurant and brewery equipment and leasehold improvements to construct new restaurants were million for the weeks ended january  these expenditures were primarily related to the development of our new restaurants during the year in willowbrook  texas  summerlin  nevada  laguna hills  fresno  san bernardino  and folsom  california and plano  texas and the construction of our rancho cucamonga  moreno valley  roseville  san bruno  and corona california and our mesa and tucson  arizona locations 
in addition  for the weeks ended january   total capital expenditures related to the maintenance of existing restaurants were million 
we have signed leases for  and plan to open restaurants in sugarland  texas  roseville  moreno valley  corona  rancho cucamonga  san bruno  and san mateo california and tucson and mesa arizona in in recent years  we have funded our capital requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and proceeds received from the exercise of redeemable warrants during our capital requirements related to opening additional restaurants will continue to be significant 
we anticipate total capital expenditures between million and million in with the majority of expenditures associated with the new restaurant openings previously stated 
other capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with prior year trends and will be primarily directed toward capital maintenance associated with existing restaurants 
we expect to fund all capital requirements for fiscal using operating cash flows  our cash on hand and investments 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash flow and our cash and investments balances together with anticipated cash flows from operations and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
the company has initiated discussions with various financial institutions and bankers to consider alternative methods to obtain capital or debt financing  as needed 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing  as needed  could have a material adverse effect on our future growth plans  business and results of operations 
sale of pietro s restaurants in february  we executed an agreement to sell our three pietro s restaurants effective on march   resulting in a million pre tax gain 
the buyers  formerly employees  purchased the restaurant assets and related trademarks for the pietro s brand 
the million sales price includes cash proceeds of million and two notes receivable from the buyers totaling  with terms of five and ten years 
the ten year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent with a minimum interest rate of and a maximum interest rate of and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the ten year term 
the five year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the five year term 
our notes are subordinated to the buyer s sba loan 
principal payments to the company on both notes were prohibited for the first six months by the buyer s sba loan 
for these three pietro s restaurants sold  sales were  and  and pre tax income was  and  for the thirteen weeks ended march  and march   respectively 
the net book value of the assets sold as of march  was  off balance sheet arrangements as part of our on going business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated vie transactions 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect our operations 
many of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
minimum wages have been increased numerous times and remain subject to future increases 
while we have been able to react to inflation and other changes in our costs of key operating expenses by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  combined with reduced purchasing costs  and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
we cannot guarantee that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
many of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and adverse weather our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal california locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher volume periods than other periods of the year 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management and are important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost 
property and equipment accounting requires estimates of the useful lives for the assets for depreciation purposes and selection of depreciation methods 
we believe the useful lives reflect the actual economic life of the underlying assets 
we have elected to use the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful life of an asset or the primary lease term of the respective lease  whichever is shorter 
renewals and betterments that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
judgment is often required in the decision to distinguish between an asset which qualifies for capitalization versus an expenditure which is for maintenance and repairs 
we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant level for indicators of impairment 
if impairment indicators were identified  then assets would be recorded at fair value 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of january   no impairment indicators have been identified 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a portion of our employee workers compensation program 
we maintain coverage with a third party insurer to limit our total exposure for this program 
the accrued liability associated with this program is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on information provided by our insurance broker and insurer  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation  and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be significantly impacted 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
we file our tax returns with the advice and compilation of tax consultants 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets future tax deductions and fica tax credit carryforwards 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
leases we lease all of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases sfas and subsequent amendments  which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases pursuant to the requirements of sfas we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furniture fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions can take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share above 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
statement r must be adopted no later than the first interim or annual period beginning after june   irrespective of the entity s fiscal year 
early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july   which is the first day of our fiscal third quarter of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations as of january   including estimated cash payments due by period in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases total for more detailed description of our operating leases  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we have entered into lease agreements related to the construction of future restaurants with commencement dates subsequent to january  our aggregate future commitment relating to these leases is million 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than twelve months as of the date of purchase 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for the weeks ended january   the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments was approximately we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
