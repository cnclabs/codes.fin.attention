this section also contains forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this report titled disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
business and industry overview ciber provides information technology it system integration consulting and other it services primarily to governmental agencies and fortune and middle market companies  across most major industries 
from offices located throughout the united states and europe  we provide our clients with a broad range of it services  including custom and package software development  maintenance  implementation and integration 
to a lesser extent  we also resell certain it hardware and software products 
in  we continued to expand our business model through acquisitions that increased our public sector federal and state local and european segments  as well as added depth to our sap related services 
we used the remaining net proceeds from our december sale of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures  as well as borrowings under our bank line of credit  to fund these acquisitions 
our operating segments are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services  client base and geography 
effective december   we have reorganized our domestic custom it solution operations and have expanded our reportable segments from three to five commercial solutions  federal government solutions  state local government solutions  package solutions and european operations 
the commercial solutions  federal government solutions  and state local government solutions  collectively  were formerly known as our custom solutions segment 
these segments comprise our us based ciber branch offices that provide it services and products in custom developed software environments 
these offices are classified into a segment based on their primary client focus category commercial  federal or state local  however they also may have clients that fall into another category 
for example  a commercial office may also provide services to a government client 
our india operations are considered part of our commercial solutions segment 
our package solutions segment is comprised of our ciber enterprise solutions division that primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including erp and supply chain management software from software vendors such as oracle peoplesoft  lawson and sap 
our european operations segment represents our offices in europe and eastern asia that provide a broad range of it consulting services that include package software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services 
the majority of our services revenue is recognized under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue is primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our commercial  federal and state local government solutions segments typically around to as compared to our package solutions and european operations segments typically around to 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our overall average rate per hour is also influenced by the results of our fixed price engagements  which can vary 
our effective average hourly billing rates are highest in our package solutions segment approximately per hour as compared to our european operations segment approximately to per hour and to our commercial  federal and state local government solutions segments approximately to per hour 
success or overruns on fixed price contracts can also influence our effective average rate per hour 
in addition  our foreign revenue is also impacted by changes in exchange rates 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
gross margin on other revenues is approximately 
this is a blend of low margin product sales typically to and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross margin on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technology change and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
in addition  the current economic downturn has negatively affected the operations of many of our clients and prospective clients and has negatively impacted their it spending 
as a result  competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong 
we have responded to these challenging business conditions by closely monitoring the utilization of our billable personnel  through continuing evaluation of the size of our workforce and required office space  and by managing our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
business combinations as part of our ongoing growth strategy  we intend to continue to selectively identify and pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses to expand our geographic reach  service offerings and client base 
during  and  we completed the following significant business combinations acquired company date consultants added goodwill added novasoft ag september million ascent technology group limited may million scb computer technology march million ecsoft group  plc january million decision consultants  inc april million novasoft ag novasoft in late  we acquired approximately of the net outstanding shares of novasoft  headquartered in heidelberg  germany  for total consideration of approximately million in cash and million of ciber common stock 
the cash portion of the payment consideration was primarily funded by borrowing under our bank revolving line of credit 
novasoft is a provider of implementation and other consulting services related to sap software products 
novasoft is an sap alliance partner and implements all of sap s erp products including mysap 
com products and industry specific applications 
at the time of the acquisition  novasoft had approximately consultants  located mainly in germany  the uk and spain 
we acquired novasoft to expand both our international presence and our capacity to deliver sap related services 
when combined with our existing european operations  we now provide sap related consulting services from european countries 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected novasoft to contribute approximately million in annualized revenue 
ascent technology group limited ascent based in hinckley  uk  ascent provides it services to medium sized enterprises with a particular focus on software implementation and sales  including both sap and sage erp solutions and microsoft 
net software services 
ascent has also developed and sells its own proprietary customer relationship management software 
the aggregate purchase consideration for ascent included million in cash and million of ciber common stock 
in addition  ascent had certain debt obligations  totaling approximately million  which we repaid shortly after closing the acquisition 
we primarily used a portion of the cash raised from our debentures to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and to repay ascent s debt 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected ascent to contribute approximately million in annualized revenue 
scb computer technology  inc scb based in memphis  tennessee  scb provides it services similar to ciber  including consulting  outsourcing and professional staffing  with a particular focus on federal and state government clients 
the aggregate purchase price included million in cash and million in ciber common stock 
in addition  scb had certain debt obligations  totaling approximately million  which we repaid shortly after closing the acquisition 
we used a portion of the cash raised from our debentures to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and to repay scb s debt 
this acquisition expanded our federal government and state local government solutions segment and added beneficial customer relationships to our commercial solutions business 
we expect that a combined ciber and scb will be able to compete more effectively for larger public sector contracts 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected scb to contribute approximately million in annualized revenue  however  scb s operations generally had lower average billing rates and slightly lower gross margins than our historical averages  which lower our measurements in these areas slightly 
the acquisition provides an opportunity to realize operational efficiencies in the form of lower combined selling  general and administrative costs  primarily by reducing scb s corporate administrative costs 
ecsoft group plc 
now named ciber europe limited is based in london 
at the time of the acquisition  ecsoft had operations in denmark  the netherlands  norway  sweden and the uk that provided it consulting services similar to services provided by ciber 
we acquired ecsoft to increase the size of our european operations and add depth to our european management team 
at the time of the acquisition we expected ecsoft to add approximately million in annual revenue 
decision consultants  inc dci was very similar to our existing commercial solutions operations 
the majority of dci s revenue was from clients that were already ciber clients and most of dci s operations were in locations already served by ciber commercial branch operations 
as a result  the primary asset acquired was the workforce in place  which is accounted for as goodwill 
like ciber  dci s consultants comprised an experienced technical workforce that we believed would help maintain and obtain business at both current and new clients 
dci added depth to our executive and operations management teams and allowed us to combine many of the dci offices with existing ciber offices to obtain economies of scale resulting in reduced overhead costs as a percentage of revenue 
also significant were the cost savings realized by combining redundant corporate back office functions 
dci added significantly to ciber s existing consultant base at ibm  ford and verizon  among others 
in addition  the acquisition gave us opportunities within some new strategic clients  however  these clients did not constitute a significant percentage of dci s revenue 
the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the closing date of the respective acquisition 
results of operations consolidated the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following table sets forth certain operating data for our reportable segments year ended december  in thousands total revenue commercial solutions federal government solutions state local government solutions package solutions european operations inter segment total revenue income from operations commercial solutions federal government solutions state local government solutions package solutions european operations corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income net interest and other expense net income year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in the revenue growth primarily resulted from our acquisitions of scb  ascent and novasoft  plus the full year benefit of our acquisitions of ecsoft and alphanet 
our acquisitions added approximately million in incremental revenue to and the full year benefit of our acquisitions added another million in incremental revenue to excluding the incremental revenue contributed by the and acquisitions  revenues would have decreased by approximately from the prior year 
approximately one fourth of the decrease was due to a reduction in services from a large telecommunications client in september of  which negatively impacted revenue on a year over year basis by approximately million 
revenue in was positively impacted by organic revenue growth in our federal government solutions and european operations segments that was offset by decreased sales in our commercial  state local government and package solutions segments 
our average number of billable consultants working during the year increased to approximately  in from approximately  in other revenues increased to million in from million in due to our acquisition of ascent and sales of their proprietary software product 
the ascent increase was partially offset by decreased domestic hardware and software sales 
our average billing rate decreased to per hour in compared to per hour in  primarily due to lower billing rates on the incremental revenue contributed by scb and offset partially by increased average billing rates in europe in part from slightly higher average rates contributed by novasoft 
in total  our gross profit percentage decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease is due to lower gross margins on services revenue  partially offset by increased gross margins on other revenue 
the decline in gross profit on services revenue was primarily due to expected lower margins on the incremental revenue contributed by scb  as well as lower profitability on three projects that experienced cost overruns 
our gross profit percentage on other revenue increased to in from in due to increased sales of higher margin proprietary software products contributed by ascent 
in addition  consultant utilization improved in to compared to utilization of in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in  due to the incremental costs associated with our acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in from in  as we continued efforts to contain costs and leverage our existing overhead infrastructure 
contributing to this was a combined million decrease in office rent and sg a depreciation expense in amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in due to additional amortizable intangible assets  primarily customer relationships  resulting from our recent acquisitions 
interest income and expense fluctuates based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed 
interest expense increased to million in from million in primarily due to the december sale of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures 
interest income is primarily from cash held in our european subsidiaries 
other income  net was million in as compared to  in other income in included foreign currency transaction gains of million as well as  of gains on foreign currency forward contracts 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rate in was favorably impacted by a federal research credit while to a greater extent was favorably impacted from tax benefits resulting from the closure of certain subsidiary operations 
our acquisition of novasoft in late has also slightly increased our effective taxes rates as novasoft operates in foreign countries with higher tax rates 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in this represented a increase in consulting services revenue  as well as a increase in other revenue 
other revenue increased to million in from million in this resulted from an increase in demand for it products during the revenue growth resulted primarily from our ecsoft and alphanet acquisitions  which closed in  plus the full year benefit of our dci acquisition 
combined  these acquisitions added approximately million in incremental revenue to these increases were partially offset by a reduction in services from a large telecommunications client  which negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in our average number of billable consultants increased to approximately  in compared to approximately  in in total  our gross profit percentage decreased to of revenue in from in this decrease was due to lower gross margins on both services revenue and other revenue 
the decline in gross profit on services revenue was due to a combination of domestic pricing rate pressure and a lower gross profit percentage on the full year incremental revenue contributed by our may acquisition of dci 
our gross profit percentage on other revenue decreased to in from in due to increased sales on lower margin computer hardware products 
lower margin computer hardware product sales accounted for of other revenue in compared to in  with higher margin commission revenue accounting for the remainder 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in from in  which demonstrated our continuing efforts to contain costs and leverage our existing infrastructure 
our rent and sg a depreciation expense  combined was million less in than it was in the absolute increase in sg a costs resulted from the incremental sg a associated with the acquired operations of dci in may of  ecsoft in january of and alphanet in june of amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from  in due to additional amortizable intangible assets resulting from acquisitions 
interest income and expense fluctuates based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed 
in december  we completed a million sale of debentures and paid off our outstanding borrowings under our bank line of credit 
interest expense increased  year over year due to the combination of increased borrowing under our line of credit to fund our acquisition of ecsoft in january  as well as interest expense relating to the debentures 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rate decreased in from the prior year due to the current year tax benefits resulting from the closure of certain subsidiary operations 
commercial solutions year ended december  dollars in thousands consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total operating income gross profit percentage consulting services gross profit percentage other revenue gross profit percentage total operating income percentage commercial solutions revenue most significantly benefited from our acquisition of dci in and  to a lesser extent  our acquisitions of alphanet in and scb in excluding the impact of acquisitions  commercial solutions revenue decreased by approximately in and in as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in revenues is primarily due to the continued intentional shift away from it staffing toward a project based solution oriented model 
this shift is substantially complete and is evidenced by quarterly revenue growth in this segment during after a decline in revenue in the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  revenue in this segment grew sequentially in the second and third quarters of revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of due to expected lower consultant utilization resulting from increased vacation time taken during the holiday season 
the single event that negatively impacted revenue in this segment the most in and occurred in september of  when a large telecommunications client significantly reduced the use of our services 
this client reduction negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in and by million in we expect the organic growth that occurred within in the commercial solutions segment to continue in since the shift away from it staffing and toward more project based work is substantially complete 
gross profit percentage on service revenue decreased by basis points to in compared to in due primarily to the full year impact of lower gross profit associated with revenue contributed by our may acquisition of dci 
gross profit percentage on service revenue improved by basis points in to compared to in due to our continued shift away from it staffing toward higher margin project based work 
our gross profit percentage on other revenue  which represents resale of third party hardware and software products  declined by basis points in compared to and by basis points in compared to continued downward pricing pressure on hardware and software  resulting from increased competition from the direct sales channels of hardware and software manufacturers  was the primary cause of the decrease in the other revenue gross profit percentage 
operating income percentage has been relatively consistent  with slight changes resulting primarily from changes in gross profit 
our average billing rate was approximately  and per hour in  and  respectively  while our consultant utilization for the same periods was  and 
commercial solutions average consultant headcount was approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
federal government solutions year ended december  dollars in thousands consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total operating income gross profit percentage consulting services gross profit percentage other revenue gross profit percentage total operating income percentage federal government solutions revenue increased significantly in both and our acquisition of scb in march of contributed to the revenue increase  adding incremental revenue of approximately million 
excluding the impact of the scb acquisition  federal revenue increased by approximately in and in as compared to the prior year 
the revenue increase is primarily due to increased spending  particularly in the areas of defense and homeland security within existing government agency clients  as well as the successful penetration of new agency accounts resulting in new contract wins 
while we do expect organic growth to continue in the federal government solutions segment in  we believe it is unlikely that this segment will grow at the same high rate as in and gross profit percentage in the federal government solutions segment decreased in by basis points to compared to in our march acquisition of scb accounted for all of that decline 
the majority of the federal revenue contributed by scb consists of long term contracts with low bill rates and low gross margins 
though gross margins are low on these contracts  the sg a overhead structure is also low 
as a result  operating income as a percentage of revenue declined by only basis points in compared to the basis point year over year decline in the gross profit percentage 
our average billing rate was approximately  and per hour in  and  respectively  while our consultant utilization rate for the same periods was  and 
federal government solutions average consultant headcount was approximately  and  in  and  respectively 
state local government solutions year ended december  dollars in thousands consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total operating income gross profit percentage consulting services gross profit percentage other revenue gross profit percentage total operating income percentage state local government solutions revenue significantly benefited from our acquisition of scb in excluding the impact of that acquisition  state local government operations revenue decreased by approximately compared to and revenue decreased compared to the decrease in revenue is due primarily to it budget constraints in the state and local government marketplace resulting from overall state and local budget deficits 
other revenue represents resale of third party hardware and software products 
if state budgets improve in  we anticipate that organic growth in the state local government solutions segment will improve  evidenced by a strong pipeline of business opportunities in this segment 
the consulting services gross profit percentage in our state local segment decreased in by basis points from in to in increased use of higher cost subcontractor labor in was the main cause of the gross profit percentage decline 
in  consulting services gross profit percentage remained relatively consistent with as consultant utilization improved slightly but was offset by a decrease in the average billing rate 
our average billing rate was approximately  and per hour in  and  respectively  while our consultant utilization for the same periods was  and 
state local government solutions average consultant headcount was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
sg a as a percentage of revenue was relatively flat in and thus the improvement in operating income percentage was due entirely to improvement in the overall gross profit percentage 
package solutions year ended december  dollars in thousands consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total operating income gross profit percentage consulting services gross profit percentage other revenue gross profit percentage total operating income percentage package solutions revenue decreased by approximately compared to and revenue increased approximately compared to the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in peoplesoft related services offset in part by an increase in oracle related services 
the market for peoplesoft implementation services was hindered in due to the uncertainty around oracle corporation s bid to acquire peoplesoft 
firms that had purchased peoplesoft software licenses were reluctant to engage firms like ciber to implement that software until there was clarity around the outcome of oracle s takeover attempt 
in january of  oracle successfully completed the takeover of peoplesoft 
we are hopeful that completion of the takeover of peoplesoft by oracle will lead to organic growth in resulting from implementation service revenue associated with peoplesoft software 
the increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in peoplesoft related services focused in the higher education market 
other revenue is from commissions on the resale of third party it hardware products 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenue in the package solutions segment declined by basis points in to compared to in the decline was due to constrained demand because of the oracle takeover attempt of peoplesoft previously mentioned  which caused consultant utilization to decline 
in addition  cost overruns on a peoplesoft project in the first half of also negatively impacted gross profit margins on service revenue 
gross profit on other revenue  which consists of commission dollars earned on the resale of certain hardware products  declined in both and compared to margins earned in each of the previous years 
the decline in of basis points from of revenue to was due to the completion of a highly profitable royalty arrangement that concluded in the first quarter of package solutions operating income in was positively affected by a decrease in sg a costs of approximately million primarily due to decreased rent occupancy costs  as well as less depreciation expense 
sg a as a percentage of revenue decreased by basis points in compared to the prior year 
our average billing rate was approximately  and per hour in  and  respectively  while our consultant utilization for the same periods was  and 
package solutions average consultant headcount was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
european operations year ended december  dollars in thousands consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total operating income gross profit percentage consulting services gross profit percentage other revenue gross profit percentage total operating income percentage our european operations segment revenue increased significantly in both and our acquisition of ecsoft in january and our acquisitions of ascent in may and novasoft in september contributed significantly to the increase 
ecsoft contributed revenue of approximately million in and million in ascent and novasoft contributed approximately million and million in  respectively 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  european operations revenue increased by approximately in compared to this includes the impact of favorable changes in foreign currency rates vs 
the us dollar  which we estimate contributed approximately million to the revenue increase 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes  our european operations had organic revenue growth of approximately in the organic growth rate is somewhat distorted by the large percentage of overall revenue contributed by acquisitions in and while we do expect organic growth to continue in  we believe it is unrealistic to expect an organic growth rate similar to that of other revenue in represents ascent s sales of proprietary and third party software products 
gross profit percentage on services decreased basis points in to compared to in approximately basis points of the decrease was due to a project overrun in our denmark operation 
the remainder of the fluctuation in gross profit percentage for both and was due to a change in the mix of our business resulting from our various acquisitions during those years of companies that operated at more traditional industry levels 
overall gross profit percentage was relatively unchanged in compared to due to high margin ascent software sales 
the acquisition of ecsoft in january caused significant changes in the gross profit and operating income percentages in compared to operating income as a percentage of revenue improved in due to the acquisitions of ascent and novasoft  both higher operating margin businesses  and also reductions in sg a payroll costs and office rent 
in addition  operating income was negatively impacted by a million operating loss within a uk subsidiary closed in the middle of that year 
our average billing rate was approximately  and per hour in  and  respectively  while our consultant utilization for the same periods was  and 
european operations average consultant headcount was approximately  and in  and  respectively  but had grown to approximately  by december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of historically  we have used our operating cash flow  periodic borrowings under our line of credit  periodic sales of our common stock as well as the sale of debentures to finance our operations and business combinations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and our operating cash flow will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and equivalents our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december  as compared to a balance of million at december  at december   substantially all of our cash balance was maintained by our european subsidiaries  of which  approximately million was held by our novasoft subsidiary 
until we acquire ownership of novasoft  our use of their cash  outside of their business opportunities or needs  is limited 
although operating results improved over  cash provided by operating activities decreased as a result of working capital changes  primarily within accounts receivable and accrued compensation 
total accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to our acquisitions  which added million of accounts receivable in the aggregate on the closing dates of the acquisitions 
total accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso was days at december  as compared to days at december  changes in accounts receivable have a significant effect on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  client mix public vs 
private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period affecting our liquidity 
accrued compensation and related liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily due to million of compensation related liabilities acquired with scb  ascent and novasoft acquisitions  being offset partially by the effects from the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle 
at december   there were only days of unpaid wages as compared to days at december  investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
we used cash of million for acquisitions in as compared to only million used for acquisitions in spending on property and equipment increased to million in from million in as we made certain investments in corporate back office systems  as well as equipment used for certain client engagements 
financing activities used cash in  primarily because our net borrowings under our line of credit were million  which was offset by our repayment of million of debt assumed with our acquisitions 
in  we received net cash proceeds of million from the sale of the debentures 
we used million of the debenture proceeds for the purchase of treasury stock and we paid off the balance under our line of credit 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when payment is made 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related contractors 
the increase in accounts payable in is partially due to both acquisitions and additional hardware related payables  while the increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities is primarily due to acquisitions 
deferred revenue increased to million at december  from  as of december  primarily due to our acquisition of ascent 
ascent receives payments from clients up front for annual software maintenance agreements 
in  we continued the repurchase of our common stock under our share repurchase program 
at december   we had authorization for the repurchase of approximately  shares remaining 
we may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock 
in early  we increased our ownership in novasoft to and we announced our intentions to attempt to acquire all of the remaining novasoft minority interest shares 
we expect the cost to acquire all of the minority interest shares would be approximately million 
convertible senior subordinated debentures in a private placement on december   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures due to mature in december the debentures are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june th and december th of each year 
we made our first required payment on june  the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments  prior to the close of business on the final maturity date only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after december   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business days after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of debentures for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the debentures  if the debentures have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions 
upon conversion  we will have the right to deliver  in lieu of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
on january   ciber made an irrevocable election to settle not less than of the principal amount of the debentures in cash and not in shares 
from december  to  but not including december   we may redeem any of the debentures if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period 
beginning december   we may  by providing at least day notice to the holders  redeem any of the debentures at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
debenture holders may require us to repurchase their debentures on december    and or at any time prior to their maturity in the case of certain events  at a repurchase price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
bank line of credit we have a million revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na that expires on september  as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
the line of credit automatically reduces to million on march  and then again to million on september  the line of credit is unsecured  unless borrowings exceed million for two consecutive fiscal quarters or if certain financial covenant thresholds are exceeded  in which case substantially all of ciber s assets would secure the line of credit 
the interest rate charged on borrowings under the agreement ranges from the prime rate of interest prime less basis points to prime less basis points depending on ciber s pricing ratio and changes  as required  on the first day of each quarter 
ciber s pricing ratio is defined as the ratio of ciber s senior funded indebtedness at the end of each quarter divided by ciber s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters then ended 
on january   the bank s prime rate was and our rate for borrowing was 
we are also required to pay a fee per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit 
this fee ranges from to depending on ciber s pricing ratio and changes  as required  on the first day of each quarter 
the terms of the credit agreement contain  among other provisions  specific limitations on additional indebtedness  liens and merger activity and prohibit the payment of any dividends 
the line of credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants including a maximum asset coverage ratio senior funded indebtedness  excluding amounts due to ibm credit under the wholesale financing agreement  divided by net accounts receivable  excluding foreign accounts and accounts securing our wholesale finance agreement with ibm credit of  a maximum leverage ratio a ratio of total funded indebtedness divided by ebitda of to  a maximum senior leverage ratio the ratio of senior funded indebtedness divided by ebitda of to  and a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio the ratio of ebitdar to total fixed charges of to we are required to satisfy the financial covenants at the end of each quarter 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  certain elements of these ratios are defined below 
senior funded indebtedness includes borrowings under our line of credit and our term loans with wells fargo plus the face amount of any outstanding letter of credit and any liabilities under our wholesale financing agreement with ibm credit 
it does not include our debentures 
total funded indebtedness includes all senior funded indebtedness plus all subordinated indebtedness 
this includes our debentures 
ebitda represents net income from continuing operations plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense  measured over the prior four quarters 
ebitdar represents net income plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense and rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
total fixed charges represents the sum of capital expenditures  plus interest expense and rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total our debentures of million are due and we presently pay approximately million annually in interest related to the debentures 
however  pursuant to their terms  they may be redeemed or converted to ciber common shares at various times prior to maturity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 
we believe the future interest obligation on our line of credit is not estimable  primarily because the balance is not predictable and because the interest rate is a variable rate determined quarterly 
assuming neither the balance nor the rate changes in  we would pay less than million for interest expense in related to the line of credit 
includes operating leases for all office locations and office equipment 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
our consulting revenue and profitability are affected by the number of workdays in a quarter 
typically  our billable hours are reduced in the second half of the year  especially during the fourth quarter  due to the large number of holidays and vacation time taken by our billable consultants 
as a result  our operating income as a percentage of revenue is generally the lowest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue earned but not yet billed  costs to complete fixed price projects  collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill  valuation of other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves  amounts related to income taxes and others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as services are performed or products are delivered in accordance with contractual agreements and us generally accepted accounting principles 
we primarily provide consulting services under time and materials or fixed price contracts 
we estimate that approximately of our service revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we estimate and accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
when billed in the following month  we compare the actual bills to our accruals and any differences are adjusted to revenue at this time 
differences are commonly the result of adjustments made as time sheets are approved  late time sheets are received and rates are changed 
for fixed price contracts for system design  development and implementation  which we estimate represents approximately of our total revenue  we recognize revenue based on the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
each contract has different terms  scope  deliverables and engagement complexities that require significant judgment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and cost is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements and other costs  as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve a certain level of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our engagements 
also  with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of cost overruns 
losses  if any  on fixed price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined 
collectibility of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectibility each month 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue as most of our revenues are from large credit worthy fortune companies and governments 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated 
the estimation of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income in our statement of operations 
valuation of other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions and estimates 
we often use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
at december   we had million of other intangible assets 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life 
accrued compensation and other liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have a number of different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary 
in addition  with respect to our potential exposure to losses from litigation  claims and other assessments  we record a liability when such amounts are believed to be probable and can be estimated 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we subsequently determine that we will realize more or less of our net deferred tax assets in the future  such adjustment would be recorded as an increase or reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  changes in the geographic mix of our business  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
we also establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not fully succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts  such as the progress of a tax audit  new case law  or expiration of a statute of limitations 
factors that may affect future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter  which may result in increased volatility of our share price 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making them difficult to predict 
this may lead to volatility in our share price 
some of the factors that are likely to cause these variations are the business decisions of our clients regarding the use of our services  the stage of completion of existing projects and or their termination  our ability to maintain our profit margins and manage costs  including those for personnel  support services and severance  acquisition and integration costs related to possible acquisitions of other businesses  changes in  or the application of changes in  accounting principles or pronouncements under us generally accepted accounting principles  currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in estimates  accruals or payments of variable compensation to our employees  and global  regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks 
our profit margin  and therefore our profitability  is largely a function of the rates we charge for our services and the utilization rate  or chargeability  of our consultants 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our consultants  we will not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer 
a number of factors affect the rates we charge for our services  including our clients perception of our ability to add value through our services  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  the use of globally sourced  lower cost service delivery capabilities by our competitors and our clients  and general economic conditions 
additionally  a number of factors affect our utilization rates  such as seasonality  including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations  our ability to transition consultants quickly from completed projects to new engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriately balanced and sized workforce  and our ability to manage employee turnover 
our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions and levels of client spending 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by regional and global economic conditions 
we continue to operate in a challenging economic environment in the united states and abroad  particularly in europe 
due to the current economic environment  some clients have cancelled  reduced or deferred expenditures for it products and services 
we have implemented cost management programs to manage our expenses as a percentage of revenue 
current and future cost management efforts may not be sufficient  however  to maintain our margins if the current economic environment continues 
in addition  our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and  consequently  the benefits of any economic recovery to our business may take longer to realize 
if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in technology  our business will be negatively affected 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  such as the evolution of the internet  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement technology services and solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry standards and client preferences 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace 
in addition  services  solutions and technologies developed by our competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete 
any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements 
we may face damage to our professional reputation and or legal liability if our clients are not satisfied with our services 
as a professional services firm  we depend largely on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality professional services and integrity to attract and retain clients and employees 
additionally  many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses 
if a client is not satisfied with our services and or we do not meet our contractual obligations to a client  it could subject us to legal liability and may be very damaging to our reputation  business  operating results and financial condition 
our contracts typically include provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services and the applications we develop  however  these provisions may not protect us  or may not be enforceable under some circumstances or under the laws of some jurisdictions 
it is possible  due to the nature of our business  that we will be sued in the future 
although we maintain professional liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
termination of a contract by a significant client and or cancellation with short notice could reduce our revenue and profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
our five largest clients accounted for of our revenue in the various agencies of the us federal government represent our largest client  accounting for of total revenue in  while no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenue 
in  we expect that the us federal government will represent approximately of our total revenues 
our clients typically retain us on a non exclusive  engagement by engagement basis 
most individual client assignments are from three to twelve months  however  many of our client relationships have continued for many years 
although they may be subject to penalty provisions  clients may generally cancel a contract at any time with short notice 
under many contracts  clients may reduce or delay their use of our services without penalty 
these terminations  reductions or delays could result from factors unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project  but could be related to business or financial conditions of the client  changes in client strategies or the economy generally 
when contracts are terminated  we lose the associated revenues and we may not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner 
consequently our profit margins may be adversely affected 
we may experience declines in revenue and profitability if we do not accurately estimate the cost of a large engagement conducted on a fixed price basis 
we estimate that approximately of our total revenue in is from engagements performed in accordance with fixed price contracts 
revenue for these types of engagements is recognized based on the estimated percentage of completion determined generally by costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
when making a proposal or managing a fixed price engagement  we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the project 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and consultants as we plan to apply them to the project 
the cumulative impact of any adjustments in estimated revenue and cost are recognized as necessary in the period during which the facts causing the adjustment become known 
losses  if any  on fixed price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed price contracts  including delays caused by factors outside of our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable and may affect the amount of revenue reported in any period 
financial and operational risks of our international operations could result in a decline in revenue and profitability 
we have continued to expand our international operations in and estimate that our foreign operations currently represent approximately of our total revenue 
we presently have offices in foreign countries 
due to our international operations  we are subject to a number of financial and operational risks that may adversely affect our revenue and profitability  including the costs and difficulties relating to managing geographically diverse operations  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed in more detail below  differences in  and uncertainties arising from changes in  foreign business culture and practices  restrictions on the movement of cash and the repatriation of earnings  multiple  and possible overlapping or conflicting tax laws  the costs of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws  operating losses incurred in certain countries and the non deductibility of those losses for tax purposes  and differences in  and uncertainties arising from changes in legal  labor  political and economic conditions  as well as international trade regulations and restrictions  and tariffs 
the revenues and expenses of our international operations generally are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the us dollar 
these exchange rate fluctuations subject us to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of our international operations and the cost of potential acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside of the us  and there can be no assurance that we will be able  contractually or otherwise  to reduce the currency risks associated with our international operations 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through our normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
there is no assurance that we will continue to use such financial instruments in the future or that any such use will be successful in managing or controlling foreign currency risks 
we depend on contracts with various federal  state and local government agencies for a significant portion of our revenue  and if the spending policies or budget priorities of these agencies change  we could lose revenue 
in  approximately of our revenue was from public sector clients  including federal  state  local and foreign governments and agencies 
in  we expect our public sector clients to comprise of our total revenues 
the market for our services depends largely on federal and state legislative programs and the budgetary capability to support programs  including the continuance of existing programs 
these programs can be modified or amended at any time by acts of federal and state governments 
many government budgets have been adversely impacted by the economic slowdown 
all but one state must operate under a balanced budget 
in addition  changes in federal initiatives or in the level of federal spending due to budgetary or deficit considerations may have a significant impact on our future financial performance  as may curtailment of the federal government s use of consulting and technology services firms  the adoption of new laws or regulations that affect companies providing services to the federal government and potential delays in the government appropriation process 
additionally  federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
among other things  governments may terminate contracts  with short notice  for convenience  as well as for default and cancel multi year contracts if funds become unavailable 
unfavorable government audits could require us to adjust previously reported operating results  to forego anticipated revenue and could subject us to penalties and sanctions 
the government agencies we contract with generally have the authority to audit and review our contracts with them 
as part of that process  the government agency reviews our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
an audit of our work  including an audit of work performed by companies we have acquired or may acquire  could result in a substantial adjustment to our previously reported operating results 
for example  any costs that were originally reimbursed could be subsequently disallowed 
in this case  cash we have already collected may have to be refunded and operating margins may be reduced 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us  or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any unfavorable determination could adversely affect our ability to bid for new work with one or more jurisdictions 
we may have difficulty integrating or managing those businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future  which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
since january   we have acquired five different organizations  three of which are european companies 
these acquisitions included decision consultants  inc  ecsoft group  plc  scb computer technology  ascent technology group limited and novasoft ag 
each of these acquisitions involves the integration of separate companies that have previously operated independently and have different corporate cultures 
as a result  we may not succeed at integrating or managing acquired businesses or in managing the larger company that results from these acquisitions 
the process of combining these companies may be disruptive to their business and our business and could have an adverse impact on the reputation and or financial results of our company as a result of the following difficulties  among others loss of key clients or management and technical personnel  additional costs and delays from difficulties in the integration of the acquired business with our existing business activities  assumption of unanticipated legal or other financial liabilities  impairment charges for acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  that decline in value  inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies among the companies being combined  making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial  accounting  billing  information and other systems  coordination of geographically diverse organizations  diversion of management s attention from the day to day business of our company  becoming significantly leveraged as a result of debt incurred to finance acquisitions  and dilution to our earnings per share as a result of issuing shares of our stock to finance acquisitions 
difficulties with integration or management may also affect client satisfaction or create problems with the quality of client service  which could have an adverse impact on the reputation of our company 
if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions in a timely manner  or at all  or if we experience difficulty integrating or managing the acquired businesses  we may not achieve the desired level of benefits in connection with the transactions 
also  the costs of achieving those benefits may be greater than we anticipate 
in the course of acquiring companies  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
historically  we have not always achieved the level of benefits that we expected from our acquisitions  nor have the acquired businesses always achieved the revenue and profitability we anticipated 
such experiences could lead to a subsequent goodwill impairment charge 
we will continue to evaluate from time to time  on a selective basis  other strategic acquisitions if we believe they will help us obtain well trained  high quality consultants  new service offerings  additional industry expertise  a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that financing for acquisitions will be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
we may issue shares of our common stock as part of the purchase price for some or all of these acquisitions 
future issuances of our common stock in connection with acquisitions also may dilute our earnings per share 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract qualified employees 
our business involves the delivery of professional services and is highly labor intensive 
our future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract  train  effectively motivate and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees  there is often considerable competition for certain personnel in the it services industry  as a result  employee turnover is generally high 
from time to time  we have trouble locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations or with required specific expertise 
the inability to attract and retain qualified employees in sufficient numbers could have a serious negative effect on us  including our ability to obtain and successfully complete important client engagements and thus  maintain or increase our revenues 
in addition  we believe that there are certain key employees within the organization  primarily in the senior management team  who are important for us to meet our objectives 
due to the competitive employment nature of our industry  there is a risk that we will not be able to retain these key employees 
the loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect our continued growth 
in addition  uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance  which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
our current indebtedness  and any future indebtedness  could adversely affect our business  our operating flexibility and our ability to make full payment on the debentures 
our aggregate level of indebtedness increased in december in connection with our issuance of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures due the terms of the debentures permit us to incur additional debt  including secured debt  and to repurchase our common stock 
additionally  the limited covenants applicable to the debentures do not require us to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results relating to our financial position or results of operations 
we also have a million bank revolving line of credit that expires on september  we have used borrowings under our line of credit to finance some of our acquisitions 
this credit facility contains specific limitations on additional indebtedness  liens and merger activity and prohibits the payment of dividends 
additionally  it requires ciber to maintain specified financial covenants  including an asset coverage ratio  a leverage ratio  a senior leverage ratio  and a fixed charges coverage ratio 
we have experienced  from time to time  instances of covenant non compliance under our line of credit that have been waived by our lender 
if we fail to comply with any covenants in the future  however  we may not be able to obtain a waiver and could be in default under a credit agreement 
in the past  we have been successful in generating cash flow from operations to reduce our indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness and had the ability to incur approximately million of additional debt under our revolving credit facility 
we may obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet our future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
an increase in our leverage could have significant negative consequences  including limiting our cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as acquisitions  due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service  limiting our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  future additional debt financing for working capital or acquisitions  limiting our flexibility to react to competitive and other changes in our industry and economic conditions generally  exposing us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  and exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations due to variable interest rates  which could result in higher interest expense 
our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness or maintain covenant compliance  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute shareholders ownership interest 
there can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be undertaken on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we may be unable to repurchase our outstanding debentures for cash or shares on specific dates or following a designated event 
debenture holders have a right to require us to repurchase the debentures on specified dates or upon the occurrence of a designated event prior to maturity as described in the indenture 
additionally  the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances 
ciber has made an irrevocable election to settle not less than of the principal amount of the debentures in cash and not in shares  under these circumstances 
we may not have sufficient funds to pay the repurchase or conversion price for all tendered debentures in cash at such time or the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
we may be subject to limitations under our bank line of credit related to the repurchase or conversion of our indebtedness 
we may be prohibited under future indebtedness from repurchasing any debentures prior to their stated maturity 
in addition  if we fail to repurchase the debentures as required by the indenture  it would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which  in turn  would be expected to constitute an event of default under any agreement relating to indebtedness  including our bank line of credit 
important corporate events  such as takeovers  recapitalizations or similar transactions  may not constitute a designated event under the indenture governing the debentures and thus not permit the debenture holders to require us to repurchase or redeem the debentures 
conversion of the debentures into shares would dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
should it occur  the conversion of some or all of the debentures into ciber common shares will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
any significant sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures could also adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
we may be unable to obtain surety bonds or letters of credit in support of client engagements on acceptable terms  if available  which could affect our ability to obtain additional client engagements that require them 
some of our government clients  largely in the state and local market  may require us to provide surety bonds or letters of credit as a condition of being awarded a new engagement 
we cannot be certain that surety bonds or letters of credit will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain surety bonds or letters of credit on acceptable terms  we may be unable to obtain additional client engagements that require them  which could negatively impact our ability to grow our business and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding surety bonds and approximately  of outstanding letters of credit supporting client engagements for which we may be required to make future payment 
the issuer of our outstanding surety bonds requires that we post a letter of credit as collateral to support these possible obligations 
we have a million letter of credit outstanding to support our current surety program 
the surety company may  at its discretion  require us to provide additional collateral as a condition for future surety bond issuances 
we cannot be certain that such collateral will be available if needed 
the it services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we operate in a highly competitive industry that includes a large number of participants 
we believe that we currently compete principally with other it professional services firms  technology vendors and the internal information systems groups of our clients 
many of the companies that provide services in our industry have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our marketplace is experiencing rapid changes in its competitive landscape 
some of our competitors have sought access to public and private capital and others have merged or consolidated with better capitalized partners 
larger and better capitalized competitors have enhanced abilities to compete for market share generally and our clients specifically  in some cases  through significant economic incentives to clients to secure contracts 
these competitors may also be better able to compete for skilled professionals by offering them large compensation incentives 
one or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting their profit margins 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into our industry 
as a result  we have faced and expect to continue to face  competition from new entrants into our market 
we may be unable to compete successfully with current or future competitors and our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of ciber or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock  thus affecting the market price of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions include adoption of a preferred stock purchase rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill that gives our board of directors the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding voting stock of ciber 
in addition  the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock  and as a result  the price of our common stock could decline 
the above factors and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of ciber  this could adversely affect transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the then current market price for their shares of ciber common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
during  approximately of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made from our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rates 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our bank line of credit has a variable interest rate
