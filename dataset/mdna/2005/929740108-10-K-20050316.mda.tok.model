we achieved these results despite higher raw material costs  especially steel and copper  and despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates  especially on the company s canadian operations 
freight rail industry statistics  such as carloadings and orders for new freight cars  improved in for example  carloadings grew compared to  as the freight railroads benefited from the strengthening economy in the us as shown below  orders for new freight cars increased to  in as a result  the backlog of freight cars ordered was  its highest year end level since sales in our freight segment have demonstrated that trend

risks associated with our four point growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company  and risks inherent in global expansion 
when necessary  we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

income taxes management believes in the next three years cash outlays for income taxes will be less than income tax expense due to the utilization of nols and the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets which will continue to be amortized for tax purposes 
the company s current level of pre tax income is sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets 
in  the company has produced a million federal net operating loss to be carried forward 
a portion of the reported federal credits in the amount of million will be realized through a carry back claim 
management believes tax planning opportunities exist in various foreign countries that will allow the company to utilize foreign net operating loss carryforwards at an accelerated rate 
any tax assets that are uncertain regarding realization have a valuation allowance in the full amount of the asset 
management believes the remaining assets will be realized in the normal course of business 
the overall effective income tax rate includes a tax benefit of million and million in and respectively  which is primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for and that have been closed from further regulatory examination liquidity and capital resources liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the company s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks credit agreement

although ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a company s operating performance and ability to service debt 
financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on ebitda 
ebitda does not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  because ebitda is not calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
management s discretionary use of funds depicted by ebitda may be limited by working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  and by restrictions related to legal requirements  commitments and uncertainties

in january  the company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks 
this refinancing credit agreement provides a million five year revolving credit facility expiring in january at december   the company had available bank borrowing capacity  net of million of letters of credit  of approximately million  subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 
refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below 
the maximum credit agreement borrowings  average credit agreement borrowings and weighted average contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were million  million and  respectively for to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable rate debt  the company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixed rate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts 
on december   the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled million and effectively changed our interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 
the interest rate swap agreements were terminated  for a net gain of about  in in conjunction with the million repayment of the revolving credit agreement 
under the refinancing credit agreement  we may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor 
the base interest rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum 
the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from to basis points depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings  cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements 
if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company s cash requirements  the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available  and  in any case  such new financing  if available  would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place

effects of inflation in general  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses  which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant 
however  higher costs of metals have reduced gross margin 
other areas of higher costs include medical benefits for active and retired employees

forward looking statements we believe that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report  including certain statements under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may constitute forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
although we believe that our assumptions made in connection with the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that our assumptions and expectations are correct 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us  including  among other things economic and industry conditions materially adverse changes in economic or industry conditions generally or in the markets served by us  including north america  south america  europe  australia and asia  demand for freight cars  locomotives  passenger transit cars  buses and related products and services  reliance on major original equipment manufacturer customers  original equipment manufacturers program delays  demand for services in the freight and passenger rail industry  demand for our products and services  continued recovery in our industry  and in particular  orders either being delayed  cancelled  not returning to historical levels  or reduced or any combination of the foregoing  consolidations in the rail industry  continued outsourcing by our customers  industry demand for faster and more efficient braking equipment  or fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  operating factors supply disruptions  technical difficulties  changes in operating conditions and costs  increases in raw material costs  successful introduction of new products  performance under material long term contracts  labor relations  completion and integration of acquisitions  or the development and use of new technology  competitive factors the actions of competitors  political governmental factors political stability in relevant areas of the world  future regulation deregulation of our customers and or the rail industry  levels of governmental funding on transit projects  including for some of our customers  political developments and laws and regulations  or the outcome of our existing or any future legal proceedings  including litigation involving our principal customers and any litigation with respect to environmental  asbestos related matters and pension liabilities  and transaction or commercial factors the outcome of negotiations with partners  governments  suppliers  customers or others

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  warranty reserves  the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates  and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes and  respectively  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company recognizes revenues on long term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the units of delivery method or other output based measures  as appropriate  are used to measure the progress of individual contracts towards completion 
contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as known 
provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts 
certain pre production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be amortized over the life of the contract 
in  we adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized on january   upon adoption of the new standard  was a charge of million after tax 
also in  amortization ceased for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
total amortization expense for intangible assets recognized was million in  million in and million in additionally  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 
we use a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecasted operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volume and pricing  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience  specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 
the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability  quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 
in general  reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales  based on historical experience 
in addition  specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 
inventory is reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories 
the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog requirements 
to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand  a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory 
also  specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 
other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age and mortality 
the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five year average market value of assets 
as a global company  wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
management does not believe that such a charge would be material

there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date 
at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis 
all outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of us dollars usd and the purchase of canadian dollars cad
