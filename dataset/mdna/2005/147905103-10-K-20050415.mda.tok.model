item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts and as noted this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations 
for more information on forward looking statements  refer to the special note on forward looking statements at the front of this annual report on form k 
our products have historically centered on fax and print servers and related technologies 
starting in  our revenues began to decline as competition increased  primarily with the print server products in the asia pacific region  while at the same time the internet and other networking technologies advanced 
as a result  we experienced annual operating losses beginning in through we redirected our efforts to focus on server appliances and on development efforts to integrate existing and future products with the internet and emerging networking technologies 
we introduced our new products  the faxpress in february  faxpress in november  faxpress sbe in february and the faxpress in september in september  we launched our newest enterprise level fax servers  the faxpress premier analog and faxpress premier digital 
today  our analog fax servers can provide up to fax channels  the digital servers up to t fax channels  the isdn servers up to fax channels and the e servers up to fax channels 
our current faxpress and faxpress premier software versions are and  respectively  to support our hardware 
in april  we completed a review of our accounting practices with respect to the historical classification of cost of service revenues  procedures for recognizing revenue associated with extended support contracts and procedures for establishing the accrual for paid time off  and determined that our historical financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and contained certain errors in the application of generally accepted accounting principles 
consequently  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for fiscal and in this annual report on form k to correct for these errors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the restated amounts 
note to the consolidated financial statements discloses the impact of the adjustments arising from the accounting errors described above on the statements of earnings and balance sheets for the restated annual periods 
improved cash management and operating results resulted in positive operating cash flows in  and cash balances increased to million at december  from million and million at december  and december   respectively 
from time to time  component manufacturers announce the end of life of certain of their products and at the same time introduce replacement components which are usually more efficient or cost effective 
we have been informed by several of our component suppliers that new components are available to replace certain of their end of life components currently used in our faxpress products 
we have been replenishing  through secondary markets  and keeping approximately two years worth of these end of life components in an effort to guarantee a smooth supply of our faxpress products to our customers 
we believe this will give us ample time to decide whether to re engineer our products with the manufacturers suggested replacement parts  or develop new replacement products 
we believe that most of these end of life components will be utilized in the following two years  resulting in insignificant amounts of excessive inventory  or none at all 
we believe that castelle s liquidity continues to be strong despite these purchases  as our cash reserves have increased during the periods when the parts were purchased 
even though we believe we have secured enough components for the next two years  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional components in the future  or be able to redesign new products in a timely manner 
these end of life products represent  of the ending inventory balance 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have defined a critical accounting policy as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f note that preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates about future events and their effects cannot be made with certainty 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  aicpa statement of position no 
sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exits 
the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the arrangement  the company defers revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  the company defers all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
product revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and returns can be reasonably estimated 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the contingency  customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
shipment generally occurs and title and risk of loss is transferred when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
we enter into agreements with some of our distributors that permit limited stock rotation rights 
these stock rotation rights allow the distributor to return products for credit but require the purchase of additional products of equal value 
customers who purchase products directly from us also have limited return rights  which expire days from product shipment 
revenues subject to stock rotation or other return rights are reduced by our estimates of anticipated exchanges and returns 
pursuant to our agreements with distributors  we also protect our distributors exposure related to the impact of price reductions 
future price adjustments are estimated and accrued at the time of sale as a reduction in revenue 
we generally provide our distributors the opportunity to earn volume incentive rebates based on sales volume achieved during the fiscal quarter 
these incentive rebates are accrued in the quarter incurred and recorded as a reduction in revenue 
we also provide co op and market development funds to our distributors 
these incentives are accrued at the time revenue is recognized and recorded as a reduction in revenue 
we offer a standard trade in discount to all of our end user customers under which the customer  upon trade in of any previously purchased product  is entitled to a discount from our published price list on any product included in our current product offerings 
we require our customers to physically return the previously purchased products to qualify for the trade in discount 
we account for the trade in discount as a reduction of revenue at the time the product is traded in and a new product is purchased 
payment terms to our distributors and customers are generally thirty days  cash in advance  or by credit card 
we evaluate product sales through our distribution channels and the related reserve requirement to establish an estimate for our sales returns reserve by reviewing detailed point of sales and on hand inventory reports provided to us by our channel partners 
based on a combination of historical return experience  the sales activities to end user customers by our channel partners and the level of inventories on hand at the channel partners  we determine our returns reserve at the end of each financial period  and increases or reduce the reserve balance accordingly 
we provide standard support to our customers for an initial period of sixty days  which includes advance swap of the defective hardware and software  bug fixes  software upgrades and technical support 
in addition to standard support  we also offer our customers the option to purchase extended support at the time of product purchase or anytime thereafter 
extended support covers hardware and software for a period of one year 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence with respect to the fair value of the standard support contracts based on standalone sales and renewals of our one year extended support contracts 
the fair value of our sixty day support contracts included with product sales is determined by pro rating the related one year extended support contracts 
we recognize revenue from extended support contracts ratably over the period of the contract 
we do not sell software  which is incorporated into our hardware  separately  other than for our customers to purchase as an upgrade to their existing products when we announce a major release of the software 
product warranty hardware is warranted for one year from the date of sale and is repaired free of charge 
provisions for estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time products are shipped as a charge to cost of sales 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should product failure rates  material usage or service delivery cost differ from our estimates  revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could affect the amount of gross profit reported 
distributor programs and incentives we enter into agreements with some of our distributors that permit limited stock rotation rights 
these stock rotation rights allow the distributor to return products for credit but require the purchase of additional products of equal value 
we also protect our distributors exposure related to the impact of price reductions 
we generally provide our distributors the opportunity to earn volume incentive rebates based upon the amount of sales volume achieved during the fiscal quarter 
we also provide co op and market development funds to our distributors 
if market conditions were to change  we may take actions to increase distributor incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
moreover  if the actual incentive offerings are different from our estimates  or if the actual incentive claims are significantly higher than our historical experience  then revisions to the estimated incentive programs may be required resulting in additional reductions to revenue 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for these distributor programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
credit  collection and allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing customer credit evaluations based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
when credit criteria are not met  we require cash on delivery or payment by credit card before products are shipped 
on a quarterly basis  we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentration  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
such losses have generally been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
three customers accounted for  and of accounts receivable at december   and  respectively 
inventories and related write downs for excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based on assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
in light of the approximately two years worth of end of life components we have purchased to ensure a smooth supply of our faxpress products to our customers  our management periodically reviews the usage  supply and inventory levels of these parts to determine whether additional purchases or excessive inventory provisions are necessary 
as of december   we have approximately  worth of end of life components on hand and we believe that most of these components will be utilized in the following two years  resulting in insignificant amounts of excessive inventory  or none at all 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the establishment or reversal of any valuation allowance is based in large part on projected future taxable income 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net sales year ended december  net sales restated restated products    services    total net sales    year ended december  net sales restated restated united states    europe pacific rim rest of americas  excluding united states total net sales    net sales increased to million in from million in the increase of  was primarily from increased sales derived from services of  offset by a reduction in products sales of  products sales of million in  which represents of total sales  declined by as compared to million in  which represents of total sales 
the lower sales in are due largely to the company s decision to divest its legacy products as part of its overall strategy to transition to its new generation of network fax servers  faxpress premier 
we anticipate sales of our faxpress premier fax servers to grow as we continue to expand into japan  hong kong and mainland china markets 
product sales in also included a one time pre tax benefit of  from an adjustment of certain accruals related to a sales development program 
service revenues are comprised of extended warranty and support programs as well as days of maintenance included with initial product sales 
revenue related to these arrangements is recognized ratably over the period of the arrangement 
service revenues in  which represents of total sales  increased to million from million in  which represents of total sales 
the increase in service revenues was primarily due to increased sales of extended warranty contracts due to an increase in our installed customer base as well as the launch of our faxpress premier fax server products in the second half of we anticipate service revenue to increase as more faxpress premier fax servers are sold 
domestic sales were million in as compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
the increase in sales was mostly attributable to the introduction of the new faxpress premier fax server products  which carry higher selling prices  an increase in service revenues and a benefit of  from a sales development program adjustment 
international sales excluding sales to the rest of the americas were million in and  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and thus  could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
sales to the rest of the americas  excluding the united states  were  in  as compared to  in  representing and of total net sales in and  respectively 
the decrease in sales was mostly due to lower sales of our faxpress fax server products

cost of sales includes cost of materials  including components  manuals  diskettes  packaging materials and shipping 
cost of sales also includes compensation costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations  inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses 
gross profit from service revenues in fiscal increased by  from fiscal due mostly to higher sales while cost of sales increased moderately 
the higher gross profit from service revenues was offset by lower gross profit of  from product sales due to product mix 
gross profit in included the benefit of  from the sales development program adjustment 
periodically we review obsolete and unmarketable products in our inventory and make appropriate allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
products that are determined to be obsolete and unmarketable are physically scrapped when it is determined that such inventories are no longer usable or salable 
in  we identified  of unmarketable products  which were scrapped  as compared to  worth of unmarketable products scrapped in research and development year ended december restated restated research and development expenses    research and development expenses as of sales research and development expenses represent costs associated with the development of new products and consist primarily of employee related expenses  material costs and allocated facility costs 
the higher research and development expenses in were mostly due to higher outside consulting expenses of  to enhance our current product features and  in higher compensation due to increased headcount  offset by a decrease in materials expense of  the employment of consultants is expected to continue until the short term projects are completed 
research and development spending has supported both existing products and the development of new server appliances 
we remain committed to the development of highly competitive new products and services through the efficient utilization of our engineering resources 
sales and marketing year ended december restated restated sales and marketing expenses    sales and marketing expenses as of sales sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives  product promotion expenses  and allocated facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was largely due to increased compensation expenses of  related to headcount additions  offset in part by lower advertising and promotional expenses of  sales and marketing expenses are anticipated to remain relatively stable 
general and administrative year ended december restated restated general and administrative expenses    general and administrative expenses as of sales general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  outside services  legal and accounting expenses  and allocated facilities expenses 
the lower expenses in  as compared to  were mainly attributable to lower compensation expenses of  mostly because of lower incentive payments due to performance goals that were not met 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in fiscal in relation to sarbanes oxley internal control compliance 
interest and other income expenses interest and other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned from our invested cash balances  interest expense on capital leases  bank service fees  and miscellaneous income and expenses 
interest and other income expense for was  as compared  in provision for income tax in fiscal and  we recorded non cash tax benefits of million and  respectively  as a result of releasing portions of our tax valuation allowance 
consequently  as of december   we have recorded a total of million of deferred tax assets 
we have not reported significant income tax expenses because we have been able to utilize available net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income 
prior to december   the company s nols were fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainly surrounding the likelihood of their realization 
due to our continued profitability over the past quarters and a determination that it is more likely than not that certain future tax benefits will be realized  a portion of the company s deferred tax assets have been recognized during the fourth quarters of fiscal and comparison of years ended december  and net sales net sales increased to million in from million in the increase of  resulted primarily from increased sales derived from services of  offset by a reduction in product sales of  products sales of million in  which represents of total sales  declined by as compared to million in  which represents of total sales  mostly due to lower sales of our faxpress fax servers

the increase in service revenues was primarily due to increased sales of extended warranty contracts due to an increase in our installed customer base 
domestic sales were million in as compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
the increase in sales was mostly attributable to the introduction of the new faxpress premier fax server products in the fourth quarter of  which carry higher selling prices  and an increase in service revenues 
international sales excluding sales to the rest of the americas were million in as compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
international sales were lower largely due to lower sales of our faxpress server products to europe 
sales to the rest of the americas  excluding the united states  were  in  as compared to  in  representing of total net sales in both and in  ingram micro  tech data and macnica  our top three customers accounted for approximately of our net sales

the higher research and development expenses in were mostly due to additional material costs of  used in the development of our faxpress premier server products that were launched in september  and higher compensation expense of  due to increased headcount 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million and million for and  respectively  and represent and of net sales for those periods 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expenses was largely due to increased promotional and travel related expenses of  and higher compensation expenses of  due to increased headcount  offset in part by lower consulting expenses of  general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in both and  and represent and of net sales for those periods 
the slightly lower expenses in as compared to were mainly attributable to lower consulting expenses of  and legal and accounting fees of  offset partially by higher compensation expenses of  and investor relation expenses of  general and administrative expenses in included legal expenses of  and outside consulting expenses of  which were chiefly attributable to our stock repurchase and nasdaq listing issues 
interest and other income expenses interest and other expenses for were  as compared to income of  in the decrease in interest and other income was chiefly due to a  reduction in interest income due to lower interest rates and decreased miscellaneous income of  provision for income tax in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash tax benefit of  resulting from the release of a portion of our tax valuation allowance 
prior to the fourth quarter  we had not reported significant income tax expenses because we had utilized available net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards 
these nols were fully reserved by a valuation allowance due to uncertainly surrounding the likelihood of their realization 
due to our continued profitability and a determination that it is more likely than not that certain future tax benefits will be realized  a portion of the deferred tax assets were recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal in  our provision for income taxes was  representing state income taxes 
the tax provision for federal income taxes was offset by utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  dollars in thousands restated cash and cash equivalents   working capital   working capital ratio since our initial public offering of common stock in december  our principal source of funding has been cash from our operations  with some funding from capital equipment lease lines 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  an increase of  from december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to cash provided by operating activities of  and  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
even though cash and cash equivalents in improved over  cash provided by operating activities declined by  primarily due to a planned increase in inventory of  mostly attributable to the purchase  net of usage  of  worth of end of life parts used in our faxpress products in an effort to guarantee a smooth supply to our customers for the next two years  and the timing of accounts payable 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was mainly due to higher earnings 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was  primarily from proceeds from issuance of common stock 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased  of our stock from open market transactions 
we acquired additional property and equipment of   and  in  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities of million in was largely for the repurchase of our stock and the professional fees associated with such repurchase 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors authorized us  from time to time  to repurchase at market prices  up to million shares of our common stock for cash in open market  negotiated or block transactions 
the timing of such transactions has depended and will depend on market conditions  other corporate strategies and has been and will be at the discretion of our management 
no time limit was set for the completion of this program 
as of december   we have repurchased from open market and negotiated transactions a total of million shares for million  at an average per share price of 
we performed no stock repurchases during the rest of and however  we may continue to execute our buyback program as we deem necessary 
in september   we entered into a million collateralized revolving line of credit with a bank  which is to expire in august the revolving line of credit provides for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under this line of credit agreement are collateralized by all of our assets and bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
under the new facility we are required to maintain certain minimum cash and investment balances with the bank and meet certain other financial covenants 
as of december   we have not drawn down on the line of credit and were in compliance with the terms of the agreement 
we lease certain of our equipment under various operating and capital leases that expire at various dates through the lease agreements frequently include renewal  escalation clauses and purchase provisions  and require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance costs 
as of december   we had  outstanding under a loan and security agreement  which is subject to an interest rate of 
we lease our headquarters in morgan hill  california 
we have extended our building lease for a term of five years commencing on june  and expiring on may   with one conditional three year renewal option  which if exercised  would extend the lease to may  commencing with rent at ninety five percent of fair market value 
as of december   future minimum payments under the lease were  the following represents combined aggregate maturities for all our financing and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than total year years years years capital finance lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations we believe that our existing cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for the next months 
if we have a need for additional capital resources  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  secure additional lines of credit or obtain other third party financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our existing and new products  if any  and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
failure to raise such additional financing  if needed  may result in our inability to achieve our long term business objectives 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  because of our dependency on a small number of distributors for a significant portion of the sales of our products  the loss of any of our major distributors or their inability to satisfy their payment obligations to us could have a significant adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risk factors shareholders or investors considering the purchase of shares of the our common stock should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to other information in this annual report on form k 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future  particularly on a quarterly basis 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to many factors  some of which are outside our control 
for example  the following conditions could all affect our results o changes in our product sales and customer mix  o constraints in our manufacturing and assembling operations  o shortages or increases in the prices of raw materials and components  o changes in pricing policy by us or our competitors  o a slowdown in the growth of the networking market  o seasonality  o timing of expenditures  and o economic conditions in the united states  europe and asia 
our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received 
in addition  significant portions of our expenses are relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
therefore  if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  the impact on net income may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the net sales shortfall 
other factors contributing to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include o changes in the demand for our products  o customer order deferrals in anticipation of new versions of our products  o the introduction and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  o the effects of filling the distribution channels following introductions of new products and product enhancements  o potential delays in the availability of announced or anticipated products  o the mix of product and service revenue  o the commencement or conclusion of significant development contracts  o changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and o the timing of significant marketing and sales promotions 
based on the foregoing  we believe that quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be viewed as indications of future performance 
we have a history of losses and may not be able to sustain profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
our development and marketing of current and new products will continue to require substantial expenditures 
we incurred  of losses as recently as due to a slowdown in demand for our products due in part to industry wide adverse economic conditions 
we were able to recover and have been profitable since the third quarter of there can be no assurance that growth in net sales will be achieved or profitability sustained in future years 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  and we have had difficulty satisfying the listing criteria to avoid the delisting of our common stock our common stock has been listed on the nasdaq smallcap market since april in order to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  we must maintain total assets  capital and public float at specified levels  and our common stock generally must maintain a minimum bid price of per share 
if we fail to maintain the standards necessary to be quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market  our common stock could become subject to delisting 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the minimum bid price per share of our common stock and thus maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our common stock is delisted  trading in our common stock could be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the over the counter market in what is commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
if this occurs  a shareholder will find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our common stock 
lack of any active trading market would have an adverse effect on a shareholder s ability to liquidate an investment in our common stock easily and quickly at a reasonable price 
it might also contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all 
failure to obtain desired financing on acceptable terms could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of our revenue comes from the sale of fax server products  and a decline in demand for those products would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of fax server products in we expect that our current products will continue to account for most of our sales in the near future 
a decline in demand for our fax server products as a result of competition  technological change  shortages of components or other factors  or a delay in the development and market acceptance of new features and products  would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we sell our products through a limited number of distributors  and any deterioration in our relationship with those distributors would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we sell our products primarily through a two tier domestic and international distribution network 
our distributors sell our products to vars  e commerce vendors and other resellers 
the distribution of personal computers and networking products has been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations due to the financial difficulties of distributors and the emergence of alternative distribution channels 
an increasing number of companies are competing for access to these channels 
our distributors typically represent other products that are complementary to  or compete with  our products 
our distributors are not contractually committed to future purchases of our products and could discontinue carrying our products at any time for any reason 
in addition  because we are dependent on a small number of distributors for a significant portion of the sales of our products  the loss of any of our major distributors or their inability to satisfy their payment obligations to us could have a significant adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a stock rotation policy with certain of our distributors that allows them to return marketable inventory against offsetting orders 
if we reduce our prices  we credit certain distributors for the difference between the purchase price of products remaining in their inventory and our reduced price for these products 
in addition  inventory levels of our products held by distributors could become excessive due to industry conditions or the actions of competitors  resulting in product returns and inventory write downs 
the market for our products is affected by rapidly changing technology and if we fail to predict and respond to customers changing needs  our business  operating results and financial condition may suffer 
the market for our products is affected by rapidly changing networking technology  evolving industry standards and the emergence of the internet and other new communication technologies 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to identify  develop  manufacture and introduce new products which o conform to or support emerging network telecommunications standards  o are compatible with a growing array of computer and peripheral devices  o support popular computer and network operating systems and applications  o meet a wide range of evolving user needs  and o achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  substantial expenses associated with the introduction and promotion of new products 
there can be no assurance that the expenses incurred will not exceed research and development cost estimates or that new products will achieve market acceptance and generate sales sufficient to offset development costs 
in order to develop new products successfully  we are dependent upon timely access to information about new technological developments and standards 
there can be no assurance that we will have such access or will be able to develop new products successfully and respond effectively to technological change or new product announcements by others 
complex products such as those offered by us may contain undetected or unresolved hardware defects or software errors when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective components could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability 
we have in the past discovered hardware defects and software errors in certain of our new products and enhancements after their introduction 
replacement of discontinued components used in our products could lead to further defects and errors 
there can be no assurance that despite testing by us and by third party test sites  errors and defects will not be found in future releases of our products  which would result in adverse product reviews and negatively affect market acceptance of these products 
the introduction of new or enhanced products requires us to manage the transition from the older products to the new or enhanced products or versions  both internally and for customers 
we must manage new product introductions so as to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
we have from time to time experienced delays in the shipment of new products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully manage future product transitions 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management  marketing  product development and operational personnel 
our success will depend  to a large extent  upon our ability to retain and continue to attract highly skilled personnel in management  marketing  product development and operations 
competition for employees in the computer and electronics industries is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain enough qualified employees 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain and continue to attract key employees  many of whom have been granted stock options 
our inability to retain and attract key employees could have a material adverse effect on our product development  business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not carry key person life insurance with respect to any of our personnel 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and may become more competitive in the future 
the network enhancement products and computer software markets are highly competitive  and we believe that competition will intensify in the future 
the competition is characterized by rapid change and improvements in technology along with constant pressure to reduce the prices of products 
we currently compete principally in the market for network fax servers and fax on demand software 
both direct and indirect competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressure  loss of market share and other factors 
any material reduction in the average selling prices of our products would adversely affect gross margins 
there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain the current average selling prices of our products or the related gross margins 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include o product functionality  o performance  o quality  o reliability  o ease of use  o quality of customer training and support  o name recognition  o price  and o compatibility and conformance with industry standards and changing operating system environments 
several of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
we also experience competition from a number of other software  hardware and service companies 
in addition to our current competitors  we may face substantial competition from new entrants into the network enhancement market  including established and emerging computer  computer peripheral  communications and software companies 
in the fax server market we compete with companies such as captaris inc  omtool  ltd 
and esker software 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not introduce products incorporating technology more advanced than the technology used by us in our products 
in addition  certain competing methods of communications such as the internet or electronic mail could adversely affect the market for fax products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on sales in foreign markets  and political or economic changes in these markets could affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
sales to customers located outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we sell our products in approximately foreign countries through approximately international distributors 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our product revenues and that we will be subject to the normal risks of international sales  such as export laws  currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collections and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties resulting from changes in foreign laws relating to the export of our products in the future 
in addition  because we primarily invoice foreign sales in us dollars  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect demand for our products by causing prices to be out of line with products priced in the local currency 
additionally  any such difficulties would have a material adverse effect on our international sales and a resulting material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may experience fluctuations in european sales on a quarterly basis because european sales may be weaker during the third quarter than the second quarter due to extended holiday shutdowns in july and august 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the level of international sales in the future 
any fluctuations in international sales will significantly affect our operating results and financial condition 
the introduction of new products may reduce the demand for our existing products and increase returns of existing products 
from time to time  we may announce new products  product versions  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of existing products 
the release of a new product or product version may result in the write down of products in inventory if this inventory becomes obsolete 
we have in the past experienced increased returns of a particular product version following the announcement of a planned release of a new version of that product 
there can be no assurance that product returns will not exceed our allowance for these returns in the future and will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to obtain components of our products from third party suppliers and subcontractors  our business could suffer 
our products require components procured from third party suppliers 
some of these components are available only from a single source or from limited sources 
in addition  we subcontract a substantial portion of our manufacturing to third parties  and there can be no assurance that these subcontractors will be able to support our manufacturing requirements 
we purchase components on a purchase order basis  and generally have no long term contracts for these components 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of high quality components from our current sources  we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments 
from time to time  component manufacturers announce the end of life of certain of their products and may or may not have replacement products 
if we are unable to secure enough inventories of the end of life components or their replacements  we might not be able to deliver our products to our customers and could adversely affect our revenue and net income 
furthermore  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or our inability to lower component or sub assembly prices in response to competitive price reductions could adversely affect our gross margin 
government regulation could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our gross margin 
certain aspects of the networking industry in which we compete are regulated both in the united states and in foreign countries 
imposition of public carrier tariffs  taxation of telecommunications services and the necessity of incurring substantial costs and expenditure of managerial resources to obtain regulatory approvals  or the inability to obtain regulatory approvals within a reasonable period of time  could have a material  adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
this is particularly true in foreign countries where telecommunications standards differ from those in the united states 
our products must comply with a variety of equipment  interface and installation standards promulgated by communications regulatory authorities in different countries 
changes in government policies  regulations and interface standards could require the redesign of products and result in product shipment delays which could have a material  adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on proprietary technology  and inability to develop and protect this technology or license it from third parties could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends to a certain extent upon our technological expertise and proprietary software technology 
we rely upon a combination of contractual rights and copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our technologies 
despite the precautions taken by us  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect our proprietary rights or offer only limited protection 
given the rapid evolution of technology and uncertainties in intellectual property law in the united states and internationally  there can be no assurance that our current or future products will not be subject to third party claims of infringement 
any litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims could result in significant expense and divert the efforts our technical and management personnel  whether or not any litigation is determined in favor of us 
in the event of an adverse result in litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in this development or that any such licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms 
we also rely on technology licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that these licenses will continue to be available upon reasonable terms  if at all 
any impairment or termination of our relationship with third party licensors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that our precautions will be adequate to deter misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technologies 
we have received  and may receive in the future  communications asserting that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties or seeking indemnification against the alleged infringement 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future products or that any assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend 
there can be no assurance that any intellectual property litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile  and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
our management believes past fluctuations may have been caused by the factors identified above  and that these factors may continue to affect the market price of our common stock 
additionally  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of the common stock of us and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to operating performance 
we anticipate that prices for our common stock may continue to be volatile 
future stock price volatility may result in the initiation of securities litigation against us  which may divert substantial management and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may require additional capital in the future  and may be unable to obtain this capital at all or on commercially reasonable terms 
the development and marketing of products requires significant amounts of capital 
if we need additional capital resources  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  secure additional lines of credit or obtain other third party financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our existing and new products and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
failure to raise such additional financing  if needed  may result in our inability to achieve our long term business objectives 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional capital would result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
recent terrorist activity in the united states and the military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business 
terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could significantly impact our revenue  costs and expenses  and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the long term effects on our business of the september  attacks and the ensuing war on terror are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other actual or potential conflicts  acts of war or hostility  including the united states activities in iraq  have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
the costs of compliance with recent developments in corporate governance regulation may affect our business  operating results and financial condition in ways that presently cannot be predicted further 
in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls  or if these internal controls over financial reporting are not effective  our business could suffer 
beginning with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of  a significant number of new corporate governance requirements have been adopted or proposed through legislation and regulation by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq national stock market 
we may not be successful in complying with these requirements at all times in the future 
additionally  we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and accounting costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new stock option plans 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with compliance with section of that law regarding internal controls over financial reporting 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result  or the effect that these increased costs may have on our operating results 
we have identified and may from time to time identify a number of deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures 
in connection with the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   our independent registered public accounting firm  grant thornton llp  determined that we had internal control deficiencies that constituted a material weakness 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement enhancements on a timely basis in order to prevent a failure of our internal controls or enable us to furnish future unqualified certifications 
a material weakness or deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our reported financial results and the market price of our stock could significantly decline 
additionally  adverse publicity related to the disclosure of a material weakness or deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our reputation  business and stock price 
any internal control or procedure  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives 
voting control by officers  directors and affiliates may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
at february   our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  together they had the ability to significantly influence the election of our directors and other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
provisions in our charter documents might deter a company from acquiring us  which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares 
our board of directors has authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation for variable interest entities  and interpretation of arb no 

the fasb published the revision to clarify and amend some of the original provisions of fin  which was issued in january  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
a variable interest entity vie refers to an entity subject to consolidation according to the provisions of the interpretation 
fin r applies to entities whose equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including equity holders  or where the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest 
fin r provides that if an entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie  the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of the vie should be consolidated in the entity s financial statements 
in addition  fin r requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie provide additional disclosures 
the provisions of fin r were effective for our fiscal first quarter 
the adoption of fin r did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
additionally  eitf issue no 
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  the disclosure requirements remain effective 
the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and superseding apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the company to expense grants made under the company s stock option program 
that cost will be recognized over the vesting period of the plans 
sfas no 
r is effective for interim periods beginning after june  the company is evaluating the alternatives allowed under the standard  which the company is required to adopt effective for its third quarter of fiscal in december  the fasb issued staff position sfas no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fsp no 
to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of which was signed into law by the president of the united states on october  companies that qualify for the recent tax law s deduction for domestic production activities must account for it as a special deduction under sfas no 
and reduce their tax expense in the period or periods the amounts are deductible  according to fsp no 
 effective for the company in its fiscal year the fasb s guidance is not expected to have a material impact to the company s financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  however  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
while much of our revenue is transacted in us dollars  certain spending is transacted in pounds sterling 
these amounts are not currently material to our financial statements  therefore we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of our money market accounts and related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the highly liquid nature of these investments 
however  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings
