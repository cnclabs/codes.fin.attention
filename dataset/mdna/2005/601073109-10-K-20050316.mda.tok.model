item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
unless otherwise indicated  all items refer to continuing operations only 
basis of presentation throughout this item  references will be made to constant currencies 
constant currency is a non gaap measure whereby foreign currency balances are translated  for all periods presented  at millipore s predetermined budgeted exchange rates for  thus excluding the impact of fluctuations in the actual foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition to analyzing us gaap financial results  we also analyze our results in constant currencies as we believe these measures may allow for a better understanding of the underlying business trends 
executive summary millipore s objective is to be the partner of choice for critical tools  technologies and services used in the discovery  development and manufacture of therapeutic compounds 
we will achieve this by leveraging our understanding of current and expected customer needs  our technology and manufacturing expertise and our direct global access to the markets 
we believe this strategy will enable us to accelerate revenue growth over the long term  improve operating profitability and generate strong cash flows from operations 
revenue growth during  revenue growth was comprised of growth in constant currencies and foreign currency impact 
this compares to revenue growth in of growth in constant currencies and an foreign currency impact 
as described in item  we sell our products into the biotechnology  life science research and other bioscience markets 
additional information related to sales into each one of these markets begins on page of this report 
biotechnology market the biotechnology market represented approximately of revenue in in constant currencies  our revenues in this market grew in compared to in sales of consumable products in this market grew and in and  respectively 
however  sales of hardware declined by in following a decline in hardware sales in this market are impacted by customers decisions to add to or modify their production capacity 
these orders can be very large and may result in significant variability in our period to period sales growth 
further  in the second half of  we adopted a more selective set of sales criteria which focused on those hardware orders with higher profitability or orders where the customer indicated intent to purchase our consumables and services 
this change in strategy contributed to the continued decline in hardware sales to this market 
we believe that consumables revenue growth patterns are more indicative of the longer term prospects for this business 
our revenue from the sale of consumables to a customer is dependent on a number of manufacturing variables related to the customer s processes and the unique characteristics of the molecule being produced 
these include expression levels  the cell culture system  the purity of the cell harvest  dosage form  batch size  optimization of the process  design age of the plant and commercial success of the drug 
we have particularly strong and broad product offerings for use in the production of monoclonal antibodies  a specific class of biotherapeutics 
our products are used in at least one of the manufacturing process steps in the majority of commercialized monoclonal antibodies 
in the short term  our revenue growth in the biotechnology market is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers who are directly influenced by the timing and approval of their drugs 
the sales cycle in this market is a long term process which follows the various stages of the drug approval process and may span five to seven years 
we provide a number of technologies that can be used in very small scale production of a drug and reliably scale up to full size manufacturing volumes with predictable efficacy 
as a result  our revenue related to a specific drug will increase over the various stages of the drug approval process  in particular  as the drug moves into clinical trials and ultimately into commercial production 
we are continuously investing in new products and technologies to expand our offerings in this market 

table of contents we believe that our long term customer relationships  our specific and differentiating technologies for this market and the number of biotechnology drugs in the drug pipeline will result in long term sustainable growth 
life science research market the life science research market represented approximately of our revenues in in constant currencies our revenues in this market grew in and in our revenue growth in this market is significantly influenced by the general economic climate and funding environment at life science research centers and contract laboratories 
the level of research and development spending by pharmaceutical organizations as well as funding of various private or government research institutions also impact our growth in the life science research market 
our primary market focus is drug development and protein research 
we believe there will be increasing demand by customers  primarily in pharmaceutical companies  for solutions that will accelerate the identification of drug candidates 
longer term  increased levels of protein related research will add to our growth in this market 
in both the drug development and protein research areas  we provide targeted products and technologies that increase the researcher s productivity  decrease cycle time and improve the quality of leads 
other bioscience market the other bioscience market represented approximately of our revenues in and grew in constant currencies in and in we have been supplying products to this market for many decades and are well positioned with our global distribution channels and recognized brand names to grow at rates equal to or greater than the underlying market growth 
during  our sales to this market benefited from strong sales to laboratories for water purification and quality control applications especially in europe 
negatively impacting growth in were declining sales in of filtration devices to non strategic applications 
product type and geography in addition to markets  we analyze our sales by product type and by geography 
in constant currencies  approximately of our revenue is from the sale of consumable products  is from hardware and is from services 
we believe that a high mix of consumable and service revenues results in a steady revenue stream as compared to hardware sales that are subject to our customers capital spending cycles 
these cycles may vary significantly from one period to the next 
our constant currency sales by geography for were distributed in the americas primarily the united states  in europe and in asia pacific 
approximately of our sales were made through our global direct sales force 
our sales force is augmented with regionally focused distributors and our on line web store 
our worldwide direct customer access allows us to rapidly introduce new products  apply our unique technology solutions to match customer needs and provide valuable feedback for our research and development team 
our mix of revenue by type and geography has been relatively consistent for each of the last three years 
profitability operating income as a percent of sales was in compared with in during  as the dollar continued to weaken  we experienced profitability pressures as foreign denominated manufacturing  distribution  selling and administrative support expenses increased due to currency translation 
however  our continued expense control and efficient operations support structure enabled us to maintain profitability levels that were approximately equal to our business operations are supported by shared service organizations that operate in regional centers 
these support functions include finance  information technologies  customer service  distribution  human resources and technical services 
the cost of these support functions is expected to grow at a slower rate than the rate of sales growth 
we will continue to invest in sales  service  and application specialists in the field to drive sales growth 
we expect to continue focusing our research and development programs on biotechnology and life science research applications 
we expect operating income as a percent of sales to improve slightly in the near term as a result of the combination of modestly improving gross profit margins and leveraging our shared service infrastructure  while continuing to invest in sales  service and research and development efforts 

table of contents cash flow cash flow from operations was million in compared with million in the improvement in cash flow from operations in is primarily from higher net income  improved accounts receivable collection experience  inventory reductions and an increase in current liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our most critical accounting policies had a significant impact on the preparation of these financial statements 
these policies include estimates and significant judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates require us to make the most difficult judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are the most critical 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when evidence of an arrangement is in place  related prices are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred contractual obligations have been satisfied and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations remain  such as customer site acceptance testing  after products are delivered  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided 
for laboratory water systems  installation and maintenance service revenues are recognized when the site service visit is completed 
for validation services provided to customers  revenue is recognized when the contracted study is complete and accepted by the customer 
revenue for certain fixed price contracts associated with our process equipment business is recognized under the percentage of completion method poc 
over the past three years  approximately of our revenues have been derived from poc sales 
revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared with the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that assumptions used in calculating poc during the construction of the process equipment  are later revised  total revenue and expenses estimated for contracts upon completion could differ from the latter estimate 
if it is estimated that the project will result in a loss when completed  the entire loss is recognized at that point 
actual results related to poc estimates have been materially the same as the assumptions used at the beginning of each contract 
in addition  should a poc contract be cancelled while in progress  we would generally be able to offset the lost revenue and incurred expense with progress payments previously received during the design and construction period 
typically such progress payments can range between and of the total contract sales value 
historically  we have experienced few cancellations 
during the last three years  there have been no poc contract cancellations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
allowances for doubtful accounts are provided when collection becomes unlikely 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  we reserve an amount believed to be uncollectible 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of gross receivables 
during the past three years  we have provided between million per year for allowances for doubtful accounts  which approximates bad debt write offs during those years 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  revenues attributable to a particular customer would not be recognized in the quarter that collection from that customer was deemed unlikely 
inventory valuation analysis 
our product life cycle is generally a minimum of years and may be in excess of years 
therefore  given the stable demand for our products  we generally rely upon recent historic usage and future demand in estimating the realizable value of our inventory 
finished goods and components that are determined to be obsolete are written off when such determination is made 
in certain cases  for newly introduced products and 
table of contents overstocked products  future demand is considered in establishing inventory write downs 
raw material and work in process inventories are also reviewed for obsolescence and alternative or future use based on reviewing manufacturing plans  future demand and market conditions 
in situations where it is determined that work in process inventories cannot be converted into finished goods  the inventories are written down to net realizable value 
inventory at december  reflects cumulative net realizable value write downs of million 
should it be determined that write downs are insufficient  we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross margin 
once written down  inventory valuation provisions are not subsequently reversed 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets are comprised of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review our long lived assets to determine if impairment has taken place 
the review of intangible assets and goodwill is performed annually at a minimum 
in addition  all long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and accordingly  the net book value of the asset may be reduced 
significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows  including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 
during and  we invested a cumulative total of million of a planned million project at the december  actual rate of exchange to expand manufacturing capacity of a core consumable product line in a building adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in ireland 
we have delayed the completion of this facility as existing manufacturing capacity supplemented with our strategic inventory supply program can meet the expected demand of this product line through we currently expect to resume construction of this facility in as there is a three year lead time before the project can be completed and consumable output validated for use in our products 
this facility is now a vacant multipurpose building shell 
if necessary  this facility could be used for the manufacturing of alternative products 
during  we conducted an impairment review of our goodwill 
the review was based on a comparison of the carrying cost of the goodwill to the fair value of the biopharmaceutical reporting unit using current valuation multiples of peer companies 
based on our tests  goodwill was not impaired during the year ended december  if the fair value of our biopharmaceutical reporting unit were substantially reduced  then we may incur charges for impairment of this goodwill 
income tax provision 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our statement of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
our valuation allowance is provided to reserve against the expiration of federal and state research credit carryforwards  state investment credit carryforwards  state net operating loss carryforwards and other state deferred tax assets 
at december   we had federal research credit gbc carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through of the million of gbc carryforwards  approximately million is reserved with a valuation allowance 
in  gbc totaling million expired unused and were written off against the valuation allowance 
at december   we also had million of state research credit and net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets  all of which are fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances  the valuation allowances may need to be increased if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income within the statutory time period that governs general business credit utilization 
any increase in the valuation allowances could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we are a worldwide business 
due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our business operations  we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis 
as a result  we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world 
we believe the reserves are necessary to adequately reflect tax obligations which may arise out of current and future audits 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us at december   the cumulative earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided are approximately million 
if these earnings were repatriated to the us  they would generate an additional tax provision to reflect the us tax rate impact 
foreign tax credits would also be generated that would partially reduce the us tax liability associated with any repatriation of earnings 
we estimate an additional million tax provision would be required to reflect the us tax on such repatriation 

table of contents on october   president bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of the ajca 
the ajca contains a number of provisions which will affect the company in the future 
one provision of the ajca establishes a special deduction for qualified domestic production activities 
this ajca provision will apply to millipore because the company is a us manufacturer 
the special deduction starts at of qualified production income as defined in the ajca qpi in and will be of qpi when fully phased in after the company is studying this provision and related irs guidance to determine its impact on the company 
a second provision of the ajca provides a temporary incentive for a us company to repatriate funds deemed to be permanently reinvested outside the us  at a reduced effective tax rate of approximately 
while the company has no current plans to repatriate earnings under the ajca  the company is studying the provision and recent irs guidance to determine whether it would be beneficial for the company to make use of the temporary incentive in the ajca imposes overall limitations on the amount taxpayers may repatriate 
in the case of the company  that limitation is million 
the range of possible amounts that the company is considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related potential range of income tax is between zero and approximately million 
if the company decides to repatriate under the provisions of the ajca  a tax provision for the related taxes will be recorded in the quarter in which the repatriation plan is approved 
employee pension and postretirement medical plans 
in the united states  we sponsor a pension plan and a postretirement medical plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
for both plans  we determine several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
for the pension plan  these key assumptions include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we considered the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan 
this included considering the trusts asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
our method is consistent with the prior year 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due 
in addition  our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience  such as for withdrawal and mortality assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by us in future years 
during  we used a discount rate of  an expected return on plan assets of and rate of future compensation increases of related to our us pension plan 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our us pension plan are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the following table shows the impact on expense of a basis point change versus the assumptions used 
positive dollar amounts would result in improved operating income  while a negative dollar amount would reduce operating income 
us pension plan sensitivity analysis in thousands expected return on plan assets discount rate 
table of contents for the postretirement medical plan  we provide to our actuarial consultants key assumptions including the discount rate and the future medical cost escalation rate 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also employ other assumptions for future experience  such as withdrawal and mortality 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from future actual results due to changing conditions in the growth of medical expenses or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of medical cost expense recorded by us 
during  we used a discount rate of and an expected medical cost escalation rate that declines gradually from in to in the following table shows the impact on expense of a basis point change versus the assumptions used 
positive dollar amounts would result in improved operating income  while a negative dollar amount would reduce operating income 
postretirement medical sensitivity analysis in thousands medical cost growth rate base base base discount rate in certain foreign subsidiaries  we also sponsor pension plans for our employees 
accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of country specific assumptions for discount rates  expected returns on assets and rates of compensation increases 
we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions which  in addition to future experience assumptions such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates  are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and expenses for each of these plans 
the following table shows the impact on expense of a basis point change versus the country specific assumptions included in the consolidated financial statements 
positive dollar amounts would result in improved operating income  while a negative dollar amount would reduce operating income 
foreign pension plan sensitivity analysis in thousands weighted average expected return on plan assets weighted average discount rate intent to refinance short term debt as long term debt 
our credit agreement allows for revolving loan borrowings of up to million 
borrowings against our credit agreement of million were outstanding at december   and have been classified as long term  because of our ability and intent to continuously refinance such borrowings 
if our intent to refinance changes  it could result in a significant amount of debt being characterized as short term debt in future financial statements 

table of contents results of operations net sales the following discussion of net sales summarizes sales growth by the markets in which our products were used  by the geographies in which our products were sold  and by product types 
net sales by market we sell our products into the biotechnology  life science research and other bioscience markets 
sales growth as compared with the prior year in constant currencies  by market  is summarized in the table below 
net sales in thousands percent sales growth biotechnology life science research other bioscience total net sales in constant currencies foreign exchange impact total net sales in us dollars of net sales in constant currencies biotechnology life science research other bioscience total biotechnology market the biotechnology market comprises approximately of total sales 
in  sales to this market grew at constant currencies consisting of a increase in sales of consumable products and a decline in sales of hardware 
this compares to constant currency sales growth of consisting of a increase in consumable sales and a decline in sales of hardware 
we sell consumable membrane filter and chromatography media products used in this market 
these products represent approximately of our sales within this market 
the continued growth in sales of consumable products during was driven by increased manufacturing campaigns of marketed biotechnology drugs  and start up and validation of new customer production lines and their processes 
we also sell hardware systems used in the production of biotherapeutics 
our filtration or chromatography hardware systems can range in price from twenty thousand dollars for standardized units to multi million dollar custom designed systems and represented approximately of our sales within this market 
the decline in hardware sales in and was predominantly driven by two factors 
in the second half of  we adopted a more selective set of sales criteria which focused on those hardware orders with higher profitability or orders where the customer indicated intent to purchase our consumables and services 
in addition  capital purchases made by our customers are generally used for construction of their manufacturing capacity and thus can vary significantly period to period based on their product demand or new drug processes 
life science research market during  constant currency sales to the life science research market grew 
throughout  we saw an increase in drug discovery and drug development spending by pharmaceutical companies especially in the united states and certain western european countries 
in addition  this market is sensitive to worldwide economic conditions as well as funding for life science in both public and private institutions 
the improvement of those conditions in as compared to further contributed to the positive growth 

table of contents the sales growth of in the life science research market was the net result of strong revenue growth for drug discovery  based on a relatively small level of revenue  being partially offset by a decline in sales of products used in genomics applications 
other bioscience market the constant currency sales growth of in the other bioscience market resulted from strong sales of ultra pure laboratory water purification systems  consumables and related services for quality control and analytical applications  modest sales growth of small and large volume parenteral drugs and nutritional products  and declines in sales of filtration devices to non strategic applications 
the constant currency sales growth of in the other bioscience market was due to increased sales of consumable products  laboratory water purification systems and services across all geographies 
growth in the americas was strong at due to increased sales to non biotechnology pharmaceutical customers  improved laboratory research funding and increased spending on us homeland defense initiatives 
however  europe s growth was in  reflecting the continued difficult economic climate 
net sales by geography sales growth as compared with the prior year by geography  measured in us dollars and constant currencies  is summarized in the table below 
us dollars in thousands percent sales growth americas europe asia pacific total net sales in us dollars constant currencies in thousands percent sales growth americas europe asia pacific total net sales in constant currencies foreign exchange impact total net sales in us dollars of net sales in us dollars of net sales in constant currencies americas europe asia pacific total in  the americas achieved constant currency sales growth of driven by strong sales of process and laboratory scale consumables 
sales benefited from the improving economic environment  improved capital markets for life science and biotech start ups  increased pharmaceutical and biotechnology spending on drug discovery research 
the modest increase in sales  in constant currencies  to customers in europe was due to a slowly improving european economy and increased laboratory activities by customers within the other bioscience markets that are in environmental  public health  clinical and university sectors 
the increase in sales within the asia pacific region was due to an improving economic conditions reduced by the impact from a change in japanese government policies which delayed the utilization of otherwise available research grants by government and university laboratories 
during  the us dollar  with respect to foreign currencies  was weaker on average as compared to prior year levels 
a weaker us dollar will positively impact us dollar sales growth 
the impact of translating foreign currency 
table of contents sales to the us dollar improved the reported sales growth rate by approximately basis points 
since we have a higher percentage of our sales in europe than in asia  the impact of translating sales denominated in european currencies has a greater impact on our sales than the impact of translating sales denominated in asian currencies 
the us dollar weakened against the euro on average by approximately and against the japanese yen by approximately as compared with during  sales growth  measured in constant currencies  was relatively consistent across our geographies  ranging between and growth 
at actual rates of exchange  the us dollar weakened throughout the year against a number of foreign currencies 
in  the us dollar weakened against the euro on average by approximately and against the yen by approximately 
the impact of translating foreign currency sales  primarily the european currencies  to the us dollar improved the reported sales growth rate by approximately basis points in net sales by product type sales growth as compared with the prior year by product type  measured in constant currencies  is summarized in the table below 
net sales in thousands percent sales growth consumables hardware services total net sales in constant currencies foreign exchange impact total net sales in us dollars of net sales in constant currencies consumables hardware services total sales of our consumables grew in all markets throughout as compared with biotechnology consumable sales growth was robust in  growing 
this is primarily due to the sales of chromatography media and filter consumables driven by increased manufacturing campaigns of marketed biotechnology drugs as well as start up and validation of new customer production lines 
the growth in the sales of services in was achieved across all markets 
the increase is due to continued demand for maintenance of our installed base of laboratory water filtration systems as well as increased marketing of validation support services to our biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers 
the slight decrease in hardware sales in as compared to was due to a combination of steady sales growth of laboratory systems used in water purification offset by declining sales of large hardware systems principally to the biotechnology market 
as previously mentioned  in the second half of  we adopted a more selective set of sales criteria which focused on those hardware orders with higher profitability or orders where the customer indicated intent to purchase our consumables and services 
gross profit margins gross profit margin percentages were in and in the decrease in our gross profit margin percentage in as compared with was primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar which increased the average cost of products manufactured in our european plants 
had exchange rates in been similar to rates  gross margins would have been approximately flat year to year 
in addition  plant start up and product validation spending for our new membrane manufacturing facility as well as increased incentive compensation expense in offset the higher net realizable value write downs of inventory and restructuring charges in in  gross profit margins benefited from a favorable mix of higher margin consumables but were negatively impacted by manufacturing start up costs related to new product introductions  increased depreciation and overhead 
table of contents expenses related to the improvement of production facilities as well as net realizable value write downs of obsolete inventory 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to manufacturing personnel severance and fixed asset write offs 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million or in and million or in  as compared with the prior years 
the increase in was primarily due to million of increased expense due to the us dollar weakening against the euro and the yen  million in ceo transition expenses  a million write off of intangibles and fixed assets related to the discontinuation of a research and development project  and million of increased incentive compensation 
in the fourth quarter of  following a research and development project review  we determined that the safepass sterile transfer technology  acquired in  would not achieve our new product profitability and cash flow criteria 
accordingly  we terminated the project and wrote off the million intangible asset and million of related fixed assets 
on april   francis j 
lunger announced that he would step down as president and ceo of the company 
mr 
lunger stepped down as president and ceo as of december   and as director and chairman of the company s board of directors as of march  in connection with mr 
lunger s separation agreement  we recorded an expense of approximately million for severance  bonus and related benefits which was recognized through march  we also expect to record additional compensation expense of approximately million to million relating to stock options  of which approximately million was recorded through march  and the remainder will be recorded days thereafter 
the amount of expense  within the above range relating to stock options  will depend upon the extent and timing of the exercise of his stock options 
we recognized a total of million expense in relating to this separation agreement 
the million or sg a increase in was primarily due to million of employee severance costs related to a reduction in work force  million of increased foreign exchange translation due to the us dollar weakening versus the euro and the yen  million for increased facility costs and million for salary related cost of living increases 
these increased costs were partially offset by million of reduced travel during research and development expenses research and development r d expenses increased million or in and million or in  as compared with the prior years 
as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in and in included in spending was a million increase in incentive compensation 
the increase in r d expense during compared with included million of employee severance costs 
excluding this cost  r d increased over the prior year  and would have been of sales 
the increases in r d spending have been driven by an increase in programs focused on the needs of our customers for new and enhanced products for purification and separation of biological fluid streams and tools which will improve the quality of leads in the laboratory drug discovery process 
restructuring and other in  we completed the restructuring program 
upon completion of this restructuring program and final cash disbursements in the second quarter of  we reversed million for previously estimated lease and severance payments  as these amounts were no longer required 
we also recognized a million benefit for assets that had been previously written off 
also in  we received proceeds of million and realized a gain of million in connection with a sale of real estate 
during  we settled a lawsuit that resulted in us paying million in damages and license fees 

table of contents net interest expense net interest expense decreased million in as compared with and decreased million in as compared with the decreases in net interest expense in and were a result of decreased amount of average debt outstanding as well as increased cash balances due to strong operating cash flow 
on march   we repaid our million  note payable 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates on net income for  and were  and  respectively 
these tax rates represent a blended tax rate primarily as a result of profits across different tax jurisdictions and specific items such as changes in valuation allowances and reserves 
the higher tax rate in when compared to was primarily a result of the reversal in of a tax valuation allowance  partially offset by an increase in tax reserves as well as the geographic distribution of profits 
during the fourth quarter of  we capitalized certain historical r d costs for tax returns on a retroactive basis  thereby utilizing net operating losses 
because of this capitalization and other tax planning strategies relating to the use of foreign tax credits  the million valuation allowance related to the foreign tax credits was released 
also in the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded additional tax reserves of million related to exposures previously mitigated by the reserved foreign tax credits 
the net impact of this activity resulted in a million tax benefit 
market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in revenues  net income and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the periods of these forward contracts typically span less than three months 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at december  the fair value of these contracts was a gain of million at december  we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact our business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
credit risk we are exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited due to the large number of established customers and their dispersion across different geographies 
capital resources and liquidity cash flow provided from operations was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash flow from operations in compared with was primarily the result of increased net income  continued strong accounts receivable collection performance  improved inventory control and higher accrued expenses 

table of contents despite higher sales volume  accounts receivable declined approximately million in compared with due to improved cash collections 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted in days sales outstanding dso improving from days at december  to days at december   as measured in constant currencies 
the improvement resulted from a higher mix of receivables in the united states where we benefit from a shorter customer payment cycle and continued strong collection performance 
we believe that our dso will continue at about the current level 
inventory decreased approximately million from december  to december  the decrease resulted from manufacturing and supply chain management programs put in place during the second half of the year that are aimed at better matching material acquisition and production to product demand 
accrued liabilities increased million from december  to december  approximately million was related to various employee compensation accruals related to improved business performance 
in addition  at december   approximately million was accrued for severance costs related to the departure of francis j 
lunger  former ceo and president of millipore 
the increase in cash flow from operations in compared with was primarily the result of increased net income  strong accounts receivable collection performance  higher accrued expenses offset by increased purchases and production of inventory 
accounts receivable declined approximately million in compared with due to improved cash collections 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted in days sales outstanding improving from days at december  to days at december   as measured in constant currencies 
the improvement occurred primarily in the united states and europe 
inventory increased approximately million from december  to december  this increase was primarily a result of planned stockpiling initiatives for key raw materials in anticipation of and sales 
accrued liabilities increased million from december  to december  approximately million of the total million of severance remained in accrued liabilities at december  as we reduced our global workforce by employees during the fourth quarter of these accrued severance payments were made during the cash flow that we generated from operations during was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and repayment of debt 
during  we purchased million of property  plant and equipment as compared to million of property  plant and equipment purchases in the and additions were driven principally by our continued need to upgrade and add manufacturing capacity 
we completed the construction of our new  state of the art filtration membrane manufacturing facility in jaffrey  new hampshire and substantially completed our new administrative facility in france 
during  we expect to spend in the range of to million on capital expenditures 
there were various capital programs in progress at december  which we anticipate substantially completing during an exception is a manufacturing facility in ireland 
during and  we invested a cumulative total of million of a planned million project at the december  actual rate of exchange to expand manufacturing capacity of a core consumable product line in a building adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in ireland 
we have delayed the completion of this facility as existing manufacturing capacity supplemented with our strategic inventory supply program can meet the expected demand of this product line through we currently expect to resume construction of this facility in as there is a three year lead time before the project can be completed and consumable output validated for use in our products 
this facility is now a vacant multipurpose building shell 
if necessary  this facility could be used for the manufacturing of alternative products 
during and  we received million and million  respectively  from employees exercising stock options and purchasing shares of our common stock in accordance with our employees stock purchase plan espp 
effective february  we discontinued the espp 
operating cash flows were also used to repay debt 
in  we repaid the million note that became due in march and repaid million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
in  we reduced borrowings under our revolving line of credit by million 
we expect to continue using cash flows from operations to invest in capital projects  to reduce debt and or to fund possible acquisitions 
we have a five year unsecured revolving credit agreement that allows for revolving loan borrowings of up to million 
the terms for interest rates on individual borrowings are established for periods not to exceed twelve months 
because of our ability and intent to continuously refinance such borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  short term borrowings expected to be refinanced  including million of amounts outstanding at december   have been classified as long term 
interest is payable on outstanding borrowings at a floating rate defined in the 
table of contents agreement as eurocurrency rate plus a margin 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was as of december  the credit agreement also calls for a facility fee at a rate ranging from to percent of the available facility 
the exact amount of the margin and the facility fee is dependent on our debt rating 
during the fourth quarter of  a leading debt rating agency upgraded our rating 
in the first quarter of  another leading agency reaffirmed their rating with a positive outlook 
the credit agreement calls for us to maintain certain financial covenants in the areas of leverage ratios and interest coverage 
we are compliant with all required covenants 
we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for the benefit of our employees 
at december   our us pension plan and postretirement benefit plans were under funded relative to their accumulated benefit obligations by million and million  respectively 
we anticipate funding for these plans will be approximately million over the next twelve months 
at december   our international retirement plans were under funded by million 
we anticipate funding for these plans will be approximately million in fluctuations in the fair market value of assets related to these plans will affect pension expense in future years 
we believe that our balances of cash and cash equivalents  our ready access to capital markets for competitively priced instruments and cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months 
the following table summarizes our minimum future payments under our contractual obligations at december  payment due total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations non cancellable operating leases employee pension and postretirement medical plans non cancellable purchase obligations total our purchase obligations include obligations related to the future purchase of goods and services  capital lease obligations  and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet

on january   the center for medicare and medicaid services released the final regulations implementing the act 
the company expects a reduction to its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation under the company s postretirement medical plan but is still in the process of quantifying the impact of the act

in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities

the revised standard is effective for public entities in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  and therefore  will be effective for the company beginning with the third quarter of fiscal the company is evaluating the new standard and its equity compensation plans and has not yet determined whether there will be any changes to these plans as a result of the implementation of the revised standard 
therefore  the company is in the process of assessing the impact of expensing stock options on its consolidated financial statements

revised  share based payment  in the third fiscal quarter of  the company will not have any stock based compensation expense from these accelerated options or the portion of the december  grant that was vested immediately 
management accelerated the vesting of out of the money options because it will improve future operating results by eliminating future compensation expense associated with these stock options that had no current intrinsic value 
management also believes that its actions provide benefit to the employees and help employee retention 
the american jobs creation act of the ajca contains a number of provisions which will affect the company in the future

business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
sales we expect sales in constant currencies to increase to percentage points over we expect our sales within the biotechnology market to grow between and in over the long term  we expect our rate of growth in the biotechnology market to accelerate as our customers progress in their development and commercialization of therapeutic compounds  particularly monoclonal antibodies 
our biotechnology customers purchase our products for use in their validated production processes 
accordingly  it is important to participate in the development of the manufacturing process for these new therapeutic compounds in order to be specified into the ultimate manufacturing process 
adoption of new technologies and products requires a lengthy validation process prior to adoption 
growth in this market is highly dependent on the development and approval of new therapeutic compounds and their commercial success 
it is difficult to ascertain the number or timing of such approvals and the extent of the commercial success of the approved compounds 
the number of drugs at various stages in the development pipeline has increased over the past several years 
there are approximately antibodies which are of particular interest to us due to our specific technology solutions 
more importantly there are approximately antibodies in phase ii and iii of the approval process 
we may not realize significant revenue growth from drugs in their first year of approval 
significant revenue growth from a drug will not occur unless and until it has been successfully accepted in the market 
we expect our sales within the life science research market will grow at to in we believe that the general economic environment is beginning to show improvement and expect that there will be an increase in drug development spending and a gradual increase in spending for protein research 
we expect that our new products and protocols used in testing for absorption  solubility and protein binding will successfully penetrate the drug discovery market from target identification through validation 
our other bioscience market approximately of total sales in is expected to be our slowest growing market in we expect that sales in this market will continue to be impacted by economic and competitive pressures  yet we are expecting the growth rates will approximate to 
approximately of our sales are to customers outside of the americas and are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
as previously noted  currencies had a net positive impact to sales in as compared with if the strong euro and japanese yen rates as of december  remain in effect throughout all of  there would be a significant impact on reported sales growth potentially increasing sales growth by basis points 
our products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply 
for certain critical raw materials  we have qualified only a single source 
we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements  in anticipation of future manufacturing needs 
with sufficient lead times  we believe we would be able to validate alternate suppliers for each of these raw materials 
several of these critical raw materials are used in a significant portion of our products and if we were unable to obtain supply of any one of them  the loss of revenues to us would be material 
gross margins we expect gross margin percentages of approximately in  approximately equal to although we expect to benefit from increased production volumes  we are cautious about expecting significant margin expansion in the near future 
during  we will be actively relocating and consolidating like kind manufacturing operations to leverage manufacturing skills  management  quality systems and manufacturing processes in order to achieve long term margin improvement 
we expect that this initiative will put pressure on margins in as personnel are reassigned and machinery and equipment is relocated 

table of contents operating expenses we expect that operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  in will be slightly lower than in we expect r d expense to average between and of net sales 
in addition  we will continue to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and development of future sales initiatives aimed at improving our competitive positions 
we expect sg a expense to average approximately of net sales in net interest expense  capital resources and liquidity net interest expense is expected to decrease again in  as we intend to use cash to reduce outstanding borrowings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the ajca 
should we decide to remit a dividend to the us  it is possible that additional borrowings will occur to finance the remittance 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in is projected to be approximately  compared with an effective rate of for the expected higher tax rate in is due to an expected higher mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions 
capital spending we expect to spend approximately to million for fixed asset additions in approximately of our capital expenditures will be focused on expanding  consolidating and updating our us research facilities and expanding our membrane manufacturing capacity in ireland 
we also expect that depreciation expense will be approximately million higher than reported in forward looking statements the matters discussed in this form k annual report  as well as in future oral and written statements by our management  that are forward looking statements are based on our current expectations
