overview we are a vertically integrated  worldwide provider of security and inspection systems  medical monitoring and anesthesia systems and optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems 
our company was incorporated in initially  we manufactured optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems for customers in several industries  including makers of security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and imaging systems 
through acquisitions we have entered the security and medical products markets because we believe that vertical integration make us more competitive in these areas 
we now operate in three identifiable industry segments a security and inspection systems  b medical monitoring and anesthesia systems and c optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems 
both the security and inspection systems and the medical monitoring and anesthesia systems groups comprise primarily end product businesses  whereas the optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems group primarily supplies components and subsystems to original equipment manufacturers and to our businesses in our security and inspection systems and the medical monitoring and anesthesia systems groups 
all inter company sales are eliminated in consolidation 
further information concerning reporting segments is available in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we design  manufacture and market security and inspection systems worldwide to end users under the rapiscan systems name 
rapiscan systems products are used to inspect baggage  cargo  people  vehicles and other objects for weapons  explosives  drugs and other contraband 
these systems are also used for the safe  accurate and efficient verification of cargo manifests for the purpose of assessing duties and monitoring the export and import of controlled materials 
rapiscan systems products fall into four categories baggage and parcel inspection  cargo and vehicle inspection  hold baggage screening and people screening 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems businesses design  manufacture and market their products worldwide to end users under several brand names 
our medical monitoring systems  network and connectivity solutions  ambulatory blood pressure monitors and related services are sold under the spacelabs medical brand name 
our anesthesia systems and components are sold under the blease brand name 
our arterial hemoglobin saturation monitors and sensors  including hand held and wireless monitoring tools  are sold under the dolphin brand name and our peripheral bone densitometers and ultrasound bone sonometers are sold under the osteometer brand name 
our optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems are used in a broad range of applications  including aerospace and defense electronics  security and inspection systems  medical diagnostics  fiber optics  telecommunications  gaming  office automation  computer peripherals and industrial automation 
we design and manufacture optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems worldwide for others through original equipment manufacturer arrangements  as well as for our own security and medical equipment businesses 
in fiscal year  revenues from the sale of security and inspection products amounted to million  or approximately of our revenues  revenues from the sale of medical monitoring and anesthesia systems were million or of our revenues  while revenues from the sale of optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems amounted to million  or approximately of our revenues 

table of contents our security and inspection systems group has continued to grow  despite challenges it faces in the cargo and vehicle inspection systems market segment 
our baggage and parcel inspection and people screening products continue to perform to our expectations 
in recent years  we have invested significantly in the development of cargo and vehicle inspection systems and advancements in hold baggage screening systems 
these investments include both the internal development of technologies and products  the acquisition of companies such as advanced research applications corp 
since renamed rapiscan systems high energy inspection corporation and ancore corporation since renamed rapiscan systems neutronics and advanced technologies corporation  and our investment in cxr  a company we now wholly own 
the cargo and vehicle inspection systems market is still in its infancy and therefore has not generated significant sales 
however  we anticipate that the united states government will establish standards for cargo and vehicle inspection at airports  border crossings and seaports and that the establishment of these standards will create a larger market for our products 
the united states government continues to invest in research and development and testing of various cargo and vehicle inspection technologies and we participate substantially in these activities 
however  as a result of our investments in cargo and vehicle inspection technologies and explosive detection systems  our security and inspection system group recorded an operating loss for the year 
we offer a broad line of security and inspection screening products and technologies as compared to our competitors and therefore anticipate that we will be well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities when they arise 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group grew substantially in fiscal year as we benefited from a full year of revenues from spacelabs medical  a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring and clinical information systems that we acquired in march from instrumentarium corporation  now a subsidiary of general electric company 
the acquisition price was approximately million in cash net of cash acquired  including acquisition costs 
spacelabs medical  based in issaquah  washington is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring systems for critical care and anesthesia  wired and wireless networks  clinical information connectivity solutions  ambulatory blood pressure monitors and medical data services 
these are areas in which we have considerable interest as they represent a natural extension of our engineering and manufacturing expertise and will add to our presence in the medical device industry 
in addition  we recently strengthened our perioperative products portfolio with the acquisition in february of blease  a united kingdom based manufacturer and distributor of anesthesia delivery systems  ventilators and vaporizers 
consideration for the acquisition of blease consisted of a cash payment of million net of cash acquired  including acquisition costs 
furthermore  during the three years following the close  contingent consideration is payable based on blease s net revenues  provided certain requirements are met 
the contingent consideration is capped at million approximately million as of june  
other products offered by our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group are experiencing growth  especially our pulse oximetry instruments which compete directly with products sold by nellcor  the current market leader in this area who owns key patents which have recently expired in the united states and other countries 
overall  our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group was profitable during fiscal year and should continue to generate profits as we consolidate and realize certain synergies stemming from the acquisitions of spacelabs medical and blease 
our optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems group met our expectations during fiscal year  with the exception of our defense optoelectronics businesses 
our defense optoelectronics businesses sell primarily to lead systems integrators  some of whom recently lost certain significant defense related contracts 
as a result  sales by our defense optoelectronics businesses declined  but were offset by growth in our commercial optoelectronics and value added subsystems manufacturing operations 
during fiscal year we began exploring strategic alternatives for our business groups 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group has grown from approximately million in annual revenues in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of spacelabs 
table of contents medical and blease 
as a result and in connection with these efforts  we engaged collins stewart  a london based investment bank to pursue the public offering and listing of approximately to of the equity in spacelabs healthcare  a newly formed subsidiary comprising the business operations of the medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group 
this offering and listing is planned in the united kingdom on the aim exchange  which is owned and administered by the london stock exchange 
the shares in spacelabs healthcare will not be offered or sold in the united states 
under securities and exchange commission regulations  us residents are prohibited from participating in this proposed offering of shares  and any shares offered cannot be acquired by us residents for a period of twelve months from the date of the offering 
comparable companies of similar size and technologies have been valued at approximately one times revenue 
we currently expect to complete the proposed transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year however  the completion of the listing remains fully subject to a number of factors  including regulatory approvals and our satisfaction with the valuation  which may not occur 
overall as a company  we also continue to move towards the consolidation of our various businesses 
in march  we rebranded our security and inspection systems businesses under the rapiscan systems name 
we have done so in order to generate manufacturing  sales force and administrative related efficiencies and to increase productivity 
in addition  we continue to invest in critical areas such as sales  marketing and research and development 
our gross margin is dependent on our product mix 
as our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems businesses grew and generated over of our revenues in fiscal year  our gross margin as a percentage of revenues has increased 
however  our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have also increased as our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems segment has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues as compared to our other segments 
certain legal expenditures related to two lawsuits and costs associated with the implementation of and audit requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of have contributed to our operating loss for the year 
we are currently involved in two legal proceedings that have resulted in high litigation related expenses  namely our lawsuit with l communications corporation  which commenced in november and stems from circumstances surrounding the acquisition by l communications corporation of perkinelmer  inc s security detection systems business and our lawsuit with science applications international corporation  which commenced in april and stems from patent infringement claims related to a gamma ray mobile detection system product we sell 
these high levels of legal and audit related expenses are expected to continue 
we engage in significant international operations 
we currently manufacture our security and inspection systems at our facilities in hawthorne  santa clara and sunnyvale  california and ocean springs  mississippi and internationally in india  finland  malaysia and the united kingdom 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems are currently manufactured at our facilities in hawthorne  california and issaquah  washington and internationally in the india  malaysia  singapore and the united kingdom 
our optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems are manufactured in camarillo  hawthorne  newbury park and upland  california  ocean springs  mississippi  north andover  massachusetts  and internationally in india  malaysia  norway and singapore 
as of june   we marketed our products worldwide through approximately sales and marketing employees located in more than a dozen countries  in addition to a global network of independent sales representatives 
revenues from shipments made outside of the united states accounted for of revenues in fiscal year  of revenues in fiscal year  and of revenues in fiscal year information regarding our revenues and identifiable assets attributable to each of our business segments is set forth in note in our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions in  we  together with an unrelated company  formed ecil rapiscan security products limited  a joint venture organized under the laws of india 
we own a interest in the joint venture  our chairman and chief executive officer owns a interest  and the president of rapiscan systems owns a ownership interest 
our initial investment was  for the years ended june   and our equity earnings in the joint venture amounted to   and  respectively  and are included in selling  
table of contents general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended june   we increased our initial investment by  our ownership interest remained at as all the shareholders increased their respective investments proportionately 
we  our chairman and chief executive officer and the president of rapiscan systems collectively control less than of the board of directors voting power in the joint venture 
as a result  we account for the investment under the equity method of accounting 
the joint venture was formed for the purpose of the manufacture  assembly  service and testing of security and inspection systems and other products 
some of our subsidiaries are suppliers to the joint venture partner  which in turn manufactures and sells the resulting products 
sales to the joint venture partner for the fiscal years ended june   and were approximately   and  respectively 
we have contracted with entities owned by members of our board of directors to provide messenger services  auto rental and printing services 
included in cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended june   and are approximately   and  for messenger service and auto rental  and   and  for printing services  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products when title and risk of loss passes  and when terms are fixed and collection is probable 
in accordance with the terms of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  where installation services  if provided  are essential to the functionality of the equipment  the portion of revenue for the sale attributable to installation is deferred and recognized when the installation services are provided 
in an instance where terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  we accrue estimated product return reserves and warranty expenses 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
we undertake projects that include the design  development and manufacture or fabrication of large  complex cargo and vehicle inspection systems that are specially customized to our customer s specifications or that involve fixed site construction 
sales under such contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
costs and estimated revenues are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project 
revenues from separate service maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
for other services  service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue for services arises from advance payments received from customers for services not yet performed 
we record billed shipping and handling fees as revenue and the associated costs as cost of goods sold 

table of contents accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts involves estimates based on management s judgment  review of individual receivables and analysis of historical bad debts 
we adjust customer credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and current credit worthiness  as determined by credit information available at that time 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands  market conditions and customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties 
if these factors are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that we will not realize some portion or all of our deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of past and current evidence  including  among other things  historical earnings  estimates of future earnings  the backlog of customer orders and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which these determinations are made 
if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and would reduce net income in the period this determination was made 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if events occur or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
this assessment requires the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units on the income approach which requires the use of estimates of future revenues  cash flows and capital expenditures  as well as market trends and growth 
we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates

revenues consist of sales of security and inspection products  medical monitoring and anesthesia systems and optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems 
revenues are recorded net of inter company eliminations 
revenues for the fiscal year ended june  increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  revenues from the sale of security and inspection products increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the sales volume of our people screening systems and an increase in service revenues  offset by lower sales of baggage and parcel inspection systems to the us transportation security administration 
revenues for the sale of medical monitoring and anesthesia systems increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the revenues of spacelabs medical  a company we acquired in march the increase was also attributable to the inclusion of revenues of blease  a company we acquired in february  as well as to growth in our pulse oximetry business 
the revenue impact of spacelabs medical and blease for the fiscal year ended june  was million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  revenues for the sale of optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal year this result was primarily due to lower sales of defense optoelectronics  offset partially by increased sales of commercial optoelectronics 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of sales consists of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million  compared 
table of contents to million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  was primarily attributable to the inclusion of spacelabs medical  which generally has a higher gross margin  but also higher operating expenses 
the increase is also attributable to a change in estimated warranty provision of approximately million due to lower than expected warranty claims on a specific product sold by the medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group 
the increase was partially offset by the negative impact on margins of current cargo and vehicle inspection projects undertaken by the security and inspection systems group  consisting of either first of a kind projects with new technologies  or development grants with minimal margins and large up front engineering costs 
the increase was also partially offset by lower sales of defense optoelectronics 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to sales  marketing and administrative personnel  professional service fees and marketing expenses 
for the year ended june   such expenses increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year as compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to the inclusion of selling  general and administrative expenses of spacelabs medical  a company we acquired in march  blease  a company we acquired in february and advanced research applications corp 
since renamed rapiscan systems high energy inspection corporation  a company we acquired in january the selling  general and administrative expenses of these three companies totaled million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was also partially attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses by our security and inspection systems group related to efforts aimed at developing a broader market for cargo and vehicle inspection and hold baggage screening systems  as well as the establishment of a bad debt reserve of million for an international cargo and vehicle inspection system receivable 
we are actively pursuing the collection of this receivable or repossession of the equipment 
finally  our corporate group also contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due to higher legal expenses related to two legal proceedings  implementation expenses incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  increased administrative headcount  outside consulting fees and legal settlement costs related to a dispute with the former president of spacelabs medical 
legal expenses related to two legal proceedings and implementation expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of were million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  these expenses are partially offset by collections of approximately million in recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off

research and development expenses include research related to new product development and product enhancement expenditures 
for the year ended june   such expenses increased by million  or  to million  compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in research and development spending was partially due to the inclusion of the research and development of spacelabs medical  a company we acquired in march  blease  a company we acquired in february and osi laserscan a business we began to operate in november research and development expenses for these three businesses amounted to million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in research and development expense was also attributable to increased spending on our automated hold baggage screening and cargo and vehicle inspection systems 
management retention bonus 
pursuant to the purchase agreement with instrumentarium corporation for the acquisition of spacelabs medical  we assumed management retention bonus agreements for key personnel of spacelabs medical 
approximately  of the retention bonuses were earned following the acquisition date and were paid in june the remaining retention bonuses vest over a two year period beginning either october  or march  as of june   we accrued a total of million  of which million related to the period prior to the acquisition of spacelabs medical 
during the fiscal year ended june   we paid approximately million in bonuses and we recognized expense of approximately million 

table of contents the current estimate of total retention bonuses paid and to be paid under these agreements is approximately million 
as of june   we accrued a total of million for the retention bonuses 
the accrual is included in accrued payroll and related expenses as of june  and restructuring charges 
in fiscal year  we consolidated manufacturing processes and facilities of certain businesses of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems and optoelectronic and value added subsystems businesses 
these consolidations resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
the consolidation consisted primarily of write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements of  that were retired during the period and charge related to clean up of a vacated facility of  we do not expect to incur further costs in relation to theses consolidations 
these charges were recorded as restructuring charges in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  these charges were calculated in accordance with sfas no

in fiscal year  there were no such restructuring charges 
income from operations 
income from operations for fiscal year decreased by million  resulting in a loss from operations of million  as compared to income from operations of million in fiscal year the decrease in income from operations was primarily due to the negative impact on gross margins of current cargo and vehicle inspection installations performed by the security and inspection systems group  which installations consisted of either first of a kind projects incorporating new technologies or which were funded by development grants carrying minimal margins and large up front engineering costs 
the decrease in income from operations was also due to increased general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses  partially offset by higher gross profit from the medical monitoring and anesthesia systems business

interest income 
for fiscal year  we earned interest income of  compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in interest income for fiscal year was due to the decrease in interest earning deposits in the current year 

table of contents interest expense 
for fiscal year  our interest expense was  compared to  for fiscal year the decrease in expense stems primarily from a decrease in borrowings in the current year compared to the prior year 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased to million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest  provision for income taxes was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the change in the effective income tax rate was due to a favorable determination of tax contingencies 
our tax rate is dependent upon the mix of income from us and foreign operations 
net income 
for the reasons outlined above  the net income for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operations  through various term loans  discounting facilities and credit lines extended to our different subsidiaries worldwide and from our private offerings 
cash and cash equivalents as of june  were million  a decrease of million  compared to million as of june  as of june   our principal source of liquidity consisted of our cash and the various credit agreements described below 
our operations used net cash of million during fiscal year compared to net cash used in operations of million in fiscal year the amount of net cash used in operations reflects increases in accounts receivable  inventory  income tax receivable and a reduction in income tax payable and advances from customers  offset in part by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and current liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable of million was due to higher revenues and the increase in inventory of million was due to product mix and anticipated higher revenues 
the net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal year  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal year in fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities reflects primarily cash used for the acquisition of blease  amounting to million  net of cash acquired and the increase in our equity investment in cxr of million 
the investing activities also include purchases of property and equipment of million  primarily for manufacturing and office facilities located in horley  england in which we co located certain of our united kingdom based rapiscan systems and spacelabs medical operations 
net cash used in investing activities also increased as a result of expenditures of million related to capitalized software development by the security and inspection systems group 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from net proceeds on term debt of million to support the purchase of manufacturing and office facilities in horley  england and net proceeds received from bank lines of credit of million mainly through borrowings under our credit agreement with bank of the west 
additionally  net cash provided by financing activities included million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock of million and the repayment of long term debt of million 
in march  we announced a stock repurchase program of up to  shares of our common stock 
no share repurchases occurred during fiscal years or through june   we had repurchased  shares at an average price per share 
in september  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of per share and we increased the number of shares available for repurchase under the stock repurchase program by  shares 
in may  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
at june    shares were 
table of contents available for repurchase under the program

other contractual obligations and commitments in fiscal year  we committed to enter into new leases for computer equipment associated with a master lease agreement previously entered into with dell financial services 
the master lease agreement provided for the leasing of computer equipment over a period of months 
the new leases that are associated with the master lease agreement have been recorded as capital leases 
the master lease agreement permits us to lease up 
table of contents to million in equipment

as of june    was outstanding under these capital lease obligations 
in november  we entered into an agreement with a third party for the design and manufacture of a patient monitor for our spacelabs medical subsidiary 
under the agreement we are required to buy a minimum number of monitors from the manufacturer during each year of the term of the agreement at a fixed price 
we may provide one year s notice to terminate the agreement without cause at any time following the completion of the second year of the term of the agreement

new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is effective for the annual periods beginning after june  sfas r therefore becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized as an operating expense in the income statement 
the cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on fair values measured on grant dates  and the new standard may be adopted using either the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the effect that sfas r will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp s fsp sfas  application of fasb statement no

 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fsp sfas grants additional time to evaluate the jobs act s impact on a company s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas we are currently evaluating the effect of the fsp s on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force modified its consensus on issue no 
 determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds 
this guidance creates stricter standards for aggregating operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds provided within sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the guidance will be effective for fiscal years ending after september  we do not anticipate that adoption of this guidance will impact the presentation of our reportable segments 
in june  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed standard entitled business combinations a replacement of fasb statement no 

the proposed standard  if adopted  would provide new guidance for evaluating and recording business combinations and would be effective on a prospective basis for business combinations whose acquisition dates are on or after january  upon issuance of a final standard  which is expected in  we will evaluate the impact of this new standard and its effect on the process for recording business combinations 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the proposed interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas the proposed interpretation requires that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
a tax position that fails to meet the probable recognition threshold will result in either reduction of current or deferred tax asset or receivable  or recording a current or deferred tax liability 
the proposed interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition of tax benefits  classification  interim period accounting disclosure and transition requirements in accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the proposed interpretation has a day comment period and will be effective for all companies as of the first fiscal year ending after december  upon issuance of a final standard  which is expected in  we will evaluate the impact that the interpretation will have on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors that may affect operating results the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements we make about our business 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results 
factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  low or fluctuating levels of political stability in regions in which we do business  
table of contents adverse changes in industries  such as semiconductors and electronics  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our revenue represented by various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations by our competitors  variations in our product mix  the timing and amount of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales  exchange rate fluctuations  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  changes in the volume or timing of product orders  timing of completion of acceptance testing of some of our products  natural disasters  and changes in general economic factors 
we face aggressive competition in many areas of business 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
in the security and inspection and medical monitoring and anesthesia systems markets  competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance  functionality and quality  cost  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  price  certification by government authorities  local market presence and breadth of sales and service organization 
in the optoelectronic devices and value added subsystems market competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices  product quality  timeliness of delivery  price  customer technical support and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and enhance our existing products in a timely manner 
we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the september  terrorist attacks and the creation of the us department of homeland security have increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
the september  terrorist attacks and the subsequent creation of the us department of homeland security have created increased interest in our security and inspection systems  however  we are not certain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as anticipated 
we do not know what solutions will continue to be adopted by the us department of homeland security as a result of the terrorism and whether our products will be a part of the solution 
additionally  should our products be considered as a part of the future security solution  it is unclear what the level may be and how quickly funding to purchase our products may be made available 
these factors may adversely impact us and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results 
if operators of our security and inspection systems fail to detect weapons  explosives or other devises that are used to commit a terrorist act  we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development  manufacturing  sale and service of security inspection systems 
our customers use our security and inspection 
table of contents systems to help them detect items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes 
some of our security and inspection systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag  parcel  container or other vessel 
others signal to the operator that further investigation is required 
in either case  the training  reliability and competence of the customer s operator is crucial to the detection of suspicious items 
furthermore  security inspection by technological means is circumstance and application specific 
in addition  our security and inspection systems are not designed to work under all circumstances 
we test the reliability of our security and inspection systems during both their development and manufacturing phases 
we also perform such tests if we are requested to perform installation  warranty or post warranty servicing 
however  our security inspection systems are advanced mechanical and electronic devices and therefore can malfunction 
in addition  there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims should an act of terrorism occur 
we are mindful of the lawsuits that are pending against airlines and other vendors  including security inspection systems providers  in new york federal court resulting from the september  and world trade center bombing attacks 
these attacks  and the potential for future attacks  have caused commercial insurance for such threats to become extremely difficult to obtain 
it is very likely that  should we be found liable following a major act of terrorism  the insurance we currently have in place would not fully cover the claims for damages 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems could give rise to product liability claims that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the development  manufacturing and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims and  sometimes  product failure claims 
we face an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our medical devices results in personal injury or death 
substantial product liability litigation currently exists within the medical device industry 
some of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems businesses have  in the past  been subject to product liability claims and or issued product recalls 
to date  no such claim or recall has had a significant impact on our operations 
future product liability claims may exceed the limits of our insurance coverages or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
consequently  a product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities  or in excess of insured liabilities  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our revenues are dependent on orders of security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and anesthesia systems  which may have lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles 
sales of security and inspection systems often depend upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports  border crossing inspection sites  seaport inspection sites and other security installations 
sales outside of the united states of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems depend in significant part on the decision of governmental agencies to build new medical facilities or to expand or update existing medical facilities 
accordingly  a significant portion of our sales of security and inspection systems and our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that typically accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if we fail to receive an order after expending such resources  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards and customer needs 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  
table of contents innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
some of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
we therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing any new product  we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues 
interruptions in our ability to purchase raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability 
we purchase certain raw materials and subcomponents from third parties pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
purchase order terms range from three months to one year at fixed costs  but we do not have guaranteed long term supply arrangements with our suppliers 
any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy  integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or make acquired businesses profitable 
one of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management  working capital and financial resources 
we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons  including competition among buyers  the need for regulatory approvals  including antitrust approvals  and the high valuations of businesses 
some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 
to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  through either public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms 
our acquisition and alliance activities could disrupt our ongoing business 
we intend to continue to make investments in companies  products and technologies  either through acquisitions or investments or alliances 
acquisitions and alliance activities often involve risks  including i difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  ii difficulty in managing product co development activities with our alliance partners  iii retaining the key employees of the acquired operation  iv disruption of our ongoing business  v inability to successfully integrate the acquired technologies and operations into our businesses and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  and vi lacking the experience necessary to enter into new product or technology markets 
in addition  from time to time  our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do 
table of contents business in the future 
reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all  and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations 
failure to complete the offering and listing of spacelabs healthcare could negatively impact our share price 
during fiscal year  we began exploring strategic alternatives for our various business groups and primarily for our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group 
in connection with these efforts  we engaged collins stewart  a london based investment bank to pursue the public offering and listing of approximately to of the equity in spacelabs healthcare  a newly formed subsidiary comprising the operations of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group 
this offering and listing is planned in the united kingdom on the aim exchange  which is owned and administered by the london stock exchange 
the shares in spacelabs healthcare will not be offered or sold in the united states 
under securities and exchange commission regulations  us residents are prohibited from participating in this proposed offering of shares  and any shares offered cannot be acquired by us residents for a period of twelve months from the date of the offering 
the proposed transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal year however  the completion of the listing remains fully subject to a number of factors  including regulatory approvals and our satisfaction with the valuation  which may not occur 
currently  there are no binding commitments on the part of any underwriter to purchase or sell any shares of spacelabs healthcare 
if the offering and listing are not completed for any reason  or not completed on time  we will be subject to several risks 
the price of our common stock may decline since the current market price may reflect a market assumption that the offering and listing would be completed and that the related benefits would be realized  or as a result of the market s perception that the offering and listing were not consummated due to an adverse change in our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems group 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales 
in fiscal year  revenues from shipments made outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues  in fiscal year and in fiscal year of the revenues generated during fiscal year from shipments made to customers outside of the united states  represented sales made by subsidiaries based in united states to foreign customers  and the balance represented sales generated by foreign subsidiaries 
since we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenues from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 

table of contents our failure to protect our intellectual property could impair our competitive position 
while we own certain patents and trademarks  some aspects of our business cannot be protected by patents or trademarks 
accordingly  in these areas there are few legal barriers that prevent potential competitors from copying certain of our products  processes and technologies or from otherwise entering into operations in direct competition with us 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and resulting claims against us could be costly and prevent us from making or selling certain products 
third parties may seek to claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate litigation in order to protect our patent or other intellectual property rights 
under either circumstance  we may incur significant expenses 
in addition  claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making  using or selling our products in the us or abroad 
our competitors may seek to challenge the intellectual property rights on which some of our new and more promising products are based 
as we introduce any new and potentially promising product  companies possessing competing technologies may be motivated to assert infringement claims in order to delay or diminish potential sales and challenge our right to market such product 
lengthy and costly litigation may be necessary in order to defend against these claims 
our ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees 
we are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees  many of whom are individually key to our current and future success  and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans 
in particular  we are dependent upon the services of deepak chopra  our chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer 
we have entered into a year employment agreement with mr 
chopra  which expires july  and we maintain a million policy of key man life insurance on the life of mr 
chopra 
the market for skilled employees is highly competitive  especially for employees in technical fields 
while our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for it to be successful  ultimately  we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans 
in addition  we may not be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
substantial government regulation in the united states and abroad may restrict our ability to sell our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems 
the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries extensively and rigorously regulate our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems  including related development activities and manufacturing processes 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction of medical devices as well as the manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for such products 
we are required to obtain clearance before we can market and sell medical devices  satisfy content requirements applicable to our labeling  sales and promotional materials  comply with manufacturing and reporting requirements  and undergo rigorous inspections 
our future products may not obtain fda clearance on a timely basis  or at all 
our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems must also comply with the laws and regulations of foreign countries in which we develop  manufacture and market such products 
in general  the extent and complexity of medical device regulation is 
table of contents increasing worldwide 
this trend is likely to continue and the cost and time required to obtain marketing clearance in any given country may increase as a result 
our products may not obtain any necessary foreign clearances on a timely basis  or at all 
once any of our medical monitoring and anesthesia systems is cleared for sale  regulatory authorities may still limit the use of such product  prevent its sale or manufacture or require a recall or withdrawal of such product from the marketplace 
following initial clearance from regulatory authorities  we continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
government authorities can withdraw marketing clearance due to our failure to comply with regulatory standards or due to the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance 
ongoing regulatory requirements are wide ranging and govern  among other things annual inspections to retain ce mark for sale of products in the european union  product manufacturing  supplier substitution  product changes  process modifications  medical device reporting  and product sales and distribution 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations may create significant environmental liabilities and force us to modify our manufacturing processes 
we are subject to various foreign and us federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
under such laws  we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or wastes that have been or are being disposed of offsite as wastes or that have been or are being released on or in our facilities 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or caused  the release of such hazardous substances or wastes 
any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes  or cessation of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm 
as directed by the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include in their annual reports an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a public company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting  as well as the operating effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
we evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow our management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls 
we expect to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by the sarbanes oxley act of however  there will remain a risk that we will not comply with all of its requirements 
for example  in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended june   our management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified two material weaknesses in our system of internal controls 
these matters are discussed in additional detail in item a of this report 

table of contents if our independent registered public accounting firm differs from us in its interpretation of the requirements imposed on us by the sarbanes oxley act of  or if it is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or with the level at which such controls are documented  operated or reviewed  it may decline to attest to our management s assessment or it may issue a qualified report 
in addition  if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls over financial reporting in connection with its audit of our financial statements and if it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures  it is possible that we could receive a qualified or adverse audit opinion in connection with those financial statements 
accordingly  in the future we may not receive a favorable report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or if we receive an adverse report from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting  investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and the market for our common stock could be adversely affected 
we receive significant amounts of research and development funding for our security and inspection systems from government grants and contracts 
we may not continue to receive comparable levels of funding for future product development 
the us government currently plays an important role in funding the development of certain of our security and inspection systems and sponsoring their deployment at airports  ports and border crossings 
however  in the future  additional research and development funds from the government may not be available to us 
if the government fails to continue to sponsor our technologies we may have to expend more resources on product development or cease development of certain technologies  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  any future grants to our competitors may improve their ability to develop and market competing products and cause our customers to delay purchase decisions  which could harm our ability to market our products 
our articles of incorporation and other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock  to fix the number of shares constituting any such series and to fix the designation of any such series  without further vote or action by shareholders 
the terms of any series of preferred stock  which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights  could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock and thereby reduce the value of our common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock  coupled with the concentration of ownership in the directors and executive officers  could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of our company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices  otherwise dilute the rights of holders of common stock and may limit the ability of such shareholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have in place a stockholder rights plan  adopted in  under which our shareholders are entitled to purchase shares of preferred stock under certain circumstances 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of our company that could be beneficial to the shareholders 

table of contents our articles of incorporation limit the liability of its directors  which may limit the remedies we or our shareholders have available 
our articles of incorporation provide that  pursuant to the california corporations code  the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under california law 
this is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by us  or in our right  for breach of a director s duties to us or our shareholders and may limit the remedies available to us or our shareholders 
this provision does not eliminate the directors fiduciary duty and does not apply to liabilities for i acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law  ii acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of our company or our shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director  iii any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit  iv acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director s duty to the our company or our shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware  or should have been aware  in the ordinary course of performing a director s duties  of a risk of serious injury to our company or our shareholders  v acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director s duty to our company or our shareholders  vi certain transactions or the approval of transactions in which a director has a material financial interest  and vii expressly imposed by statute for approval of certain improper distributions to shareholders or certain loans or guarantees

however  the following events  among others  could adversely affect our financial results in subsequent periods periodic economic downturns in different regions of the world  changes in trade policies or tariffs and political instability
