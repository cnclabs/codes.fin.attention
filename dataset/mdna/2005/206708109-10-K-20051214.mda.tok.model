our solutions are designed to automate and streamline business processes  reduce operating costs  improve internal controls  and empower businesses to apply greater insight to their spending patterns through comprehensive analytics 
our flagship products are our concur expense services and software for automating the travel and entertainment expense management process 
we also offer value added services and software that are integrated with our core services and software  as well as consulting  customer support and training for our customers 
we offer our solutions under flexible delivery models that range from highly configurable to standardized 
we sell our solutions primarily as subscription services and  to a lesser extent  through our on premises license agreements 
we market and sell our solutions worldwide through our direct sales organization and indirect distribution channels 
we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services  consulting services  and  to a lesser extent  the sale of software licenses 
subscription revenues grew from of total revenues in fiscal  to in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal this growth reflects our strategic shift to emphasize sales of subscription services rather than license software 
generally  our subscription services revenues are recognized over the time period we provide our services to customers  in contrast to license revenues  which typically are recognized upon software delivery to the customer 
we believe that our strategic shift to the subscription services model provides more stable and predictable revenues and operating results compared to prior years when our license revenues represented a more significant portion of our total revenues  because revenue in any particular period is less dependent upon a small number of large transactions 
when we first began selling expense management software in  we offered our products under a traditional software license model 
in  we began offering concur expense as a subscription service and  since that time  we 
table of contents have largely shifted to providing our solutions on a subscription basis 
we continue to sell licensed software and support license customers under a traditional software license model 
our strategic focus in fiscal is to continue to grow our core subscription business and to reduce our cost of deploying and operating our services 
we expect our subscription revenues to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues  due to anticipated demand for our subscription services 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily reflecting our continued emphasis on growing our sales headcount to support expected demand and create additional awareness in our target market 
we operate in and report on one segment corporate expense management services and software 
selected financial data in the following table  we show financial data derived from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended september  revenues subscription consulting other total revenues expenses cost of operations sales and marketing systems development and programming general and administrative amortization of intangible asset total expenses income from operations other income  net net income results of operations revenues year ended september  change change dollars in thousands subscription consulting other total revenues subscription revenues 
subscription revenues consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services  the amortization of set up fees paid to us in connection with those services  the amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements  and in some multiple element subscription 
table of contents arrangements where there is no vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered subscription element  the amortized portion of the related license and consulting fees 
subscription revenues are affected by pricing  number of new customers  customer contract durations  and our customer retention rate 
subscription revenues increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from our subscription services total subscription revenues excluding revenue from the amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements contributed approximately of the absolute dollar increase 
an increase in the number of customers for our subscription services was the main reason for the increase 
the larger number of customer reflects a trend of increased market demand for our subscription services and strong retention of existing subscription customers 
we believe this expansion is due primarily to the market s continued and growing acceptance of outsourced services  driven in part by limited information technology capital budgets 
we believe these economic trends make traditional self hosted software license arrangements  with their substantial up front costs  less attractive than subscription services 
subscription revenues increased million or in fiscal over fiscal revenues from our subscription services total subscription revenues less revenue from the amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements contributed approximately of the absolute dollar increase in subscription revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in subscription revenues reflects expansion of our existing customer base for outsourced subscription services due to the factors described above for fiscal we expect subscription revenues to continue to grow in fiscal  on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues  as a result of the growing demand for our subscription service offerings and our planned increase in spending on sales and marketing 
consulting revenues 
consulting revenues consist of fees for client services  which include system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
consulting revenues are affected predominantly by the number and complexity of license customer upgrade implementations 
recognized consulting revenues are also affected by circumstances in which consulting fees in multiple element arrangements require deferral or are deemed to be subscription related 
consulting revenues increased million or in fiscal over fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased consulting services performed for existing license customers upgrading to the latest version of our on premise license software 
these increases were offset in part by the deferral of revenues totaling approximately million during the fiscal year ended september   related to consulting services performed under contracts through strategic resellers  which are required to be recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contracts 
the million or decrease in consulting revenues in fiscal from fiscal  was due in part to the deferral of revenues totaling approximately million in fiscal relating to consulting services performed under contracts signed in fiscal through certain strategic resellers  which are required to be recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contracts  due to the structure of those customer contracts 
the decrease was also attributable to fewer new license customers added  due to our business focus on providing outsourced subscription services  and to fewer upgrades and enhancements for existing customers during fiscal  compared to fiscal we anticipate that consulting revenues in fiscal will fluctuate on a quarterly basis but be lower for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of fewer existing customers upgrading to on premise license software in fiscal compared to fiscal other revenues 
other revenues consist of fees earned from sales of our software licenses 

table of contents other revenues decreased approximately million or for fiscal compared to fiscal and million or in fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases reflect the market s continued shift in focus to our subscription services away from licensed sales 
we expect the absolute dollar value of other revenues to decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflecting the market s continued shift in demand from a licensed model to a subscription services model 
international revenues 
revenues from customers outside the united states were million of total revenues  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
historically  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
we expect our international revenues to grow in the near term  as our products and services continue to gain acceptance in international markets  due in part to the expansion of international functionality within our solutions 
expenses year ended september  change change dollars in thousands cost of operations sales and marketing systems development and programming general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total expenses cost of operations 
cost of operations expenses primarily consist of salaries and related expenses including travel related expenses and allocated overhead costs which include depreciation  occupancy  insurance  telecommunications  and computer equipment expenses associated with employees and contractors who provide our subscription and consulting services 
cost of operations expenses also include co location and related telecommunications costs  fees paid to third parties for referrals  resale arrangements  royalties  and amortization of deferred set up costs we incur in connection with our subscription services 
cost of operations expenses represented of total revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal total salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs increased or million during fiscal over fiscal  due primarily to increased headcount 
co location and related telecommunications costs decreased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to an improvement in the negotiated cost of such services 
fees paid to third parties for referrals  resale arrangements  and royalties increased or million during fiscal when compared to fiscal this increase was due to an increase in the amount of business generated through reseller partners for subscription based sales 
cost of operations expenses represented of total revenues in fiscal compared with for fiscal despite a decline in other revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  cost of operations expenses  for our subscription and consulting services combined  decreased to of the related revenues in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was due in part to improvements in our solutions and implementation methodology  which enables us to provide our subscription and consulting services more efficiently  and the increase in new sales of our subscription services for which implementation costs are deferred and amortized 
total salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs increased for fiscal compared to fiscal co location and related telecommunications costs decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to our consolidation of existing co location facilities 
fees 
table of contents paid to third parties for referrals  resale arrangements  and royalties decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease reflected lower royalties for sub licensing third party software expense  due primarily to lower other sales  offset in part by an increase in reseller partner fees for subscription based sales 
we expect cost of operations expenses to continue to trend down as a percentage of total revenues as the incremental cost to deploy and support each new customer is expected to decrease due to economies of scale anticipated in our subscription service model infrastructure 
we anticipate that cost of operations will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our capacity to deploy and support additional new customers 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including sales commissions and travel related expenses and allocated overhead costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel  and  to a lesser extent  miscellaneous sales and marketing costs  such as advertising  trade shows  and other promotional activities 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues in fiscal compared to for fiscal total sales and marketing expenses increased approximately million or during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase during the year was mainly due to a or million increase in salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs  driven primarily by headcount increases  as well as increases of or million in costs for advertising  trade shows and other promotional activities 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the or million decrease in sales and marketing expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs  offset in part by an increase of in advertising costs 
we expect total sales and marketing expenses in fiscal to increase in absolute dollars compared to fiscal  driven primarily by an increase in sales headcount  which was more than greater at september  than september  this increase in sales headcount reflects a key part of our strategic focus in fiscal  which is to ensure that our sales and marketing efforts are able to support expected demand and create additional awareness in our target market 
systems development and programming costs 
systems development and programming costs consist of salaries and related expenses  and allocated overhead costs associated with employees and contractors engaged in software engineering  program management  and quality assurance 
systems development and programming costs were of total revenues for fiscal compared to for fiscal systems development and programming costs recognized increased million or for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was nearly all due to increased salaries and related expenses 
in response to growing demand for our subscription services  we have increased the amount of resources focused on the development and programming of internal use software used to provide these services 
under generally accepted accounting principles  costs for corporate software developed or obtained for internal use are required to be capitalized and amortized over their useful lives 
internal use software costs capitalized increased million from million at september  to million at september  systems development and programming costs were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal systems development and programming costs decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal internal use software costs capitalized  net of amortization  represented million of the decrease in systems development and programming costs for fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by an increase in personnel and allocated overhead costs totaling million in fiscal 
table of contents compared to fiscal this additional capitalization was primarily the result of our increase in the amount of focused resources as noted above 
we anticipate that recognized systems development and programming costs in fiscal will increase moderately compared to fiscal as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs  all associated with employees and contractors in finance  human resources  legal  information technology  facilities  and  to a lesser extent  miscellaneous costs  such as professional fees and public company regulatory compliance costs 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenues for fiscal compared to for fiscal general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or for fiscal over fiscal excluding the impact of a million charge in the first quarter of fiscal for previously capitalized costs related to an acquisition that we had been evaluating but chose not to pursue  general and administrative expenses increased million or for fiscal over fiscal this increase was primarily due to a or million increase in headcount and related expenses and allocated overhead costs  driven primarily by headcount increases related to the growth of our business  and an or million increase in miscellaneous costs due in part to larger legal and accounting fees and costs of public company regulatory compliance 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in total for fiscal compared to fiscal  due to an increase in salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead costs of and an increase of in miscellaneous costs for fiscal compared to fiscal the majority of the increase in general and administrative expense is due to costs related to the growth of our business as well as miscellaneous costs due in part to larger legal and accounting fees and costs of public company regulatory compliance 
we expect the absolute dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase moderately in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in personnel costs related to the growth of our business 
amortization of intangible asset 
amortization of intangible asset represents the allocation of the acquired customer base intangible asset from our july acquisition of captura 
this intangible asset is being ratably amortized as a non cash charge to operations over five years  consistent with the timing and level of the expected cash flows from the underlying acquired customer contracts 
other year ended september  change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense interest income and interest expense 
the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal and reflects higher short term interest rates and higher levels of interest earning cash and cash equivalent investments 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal  was due to lower average outstanding bank borrowings and capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded as we have accumulated significant net losses since inception  resulting in deferred tax assets 
since our utilization of these 
table of contents deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits  which are not assured  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets 
financial condition our total assets were million at september  and million at september   representing an increase of million or 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at september  and million as of september   representing a decrease of million  or 
our cash flow activity is described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
net property and equipment increased to million at september  from million at september   with the largest increase due to the million of lessor provided tenant improvements  additional purchases of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and software and investment in software used internally  with the latter two primarily attributable to our subscription services offerings 
accounts receivable balances  net of allowances of million  were million and million as of september  and september   respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increase was mainly due to increased sales volume at september  our total current liabilities were million and million at september  and september   respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase was mainly due to additional accrued compensation and an increase in the current portion of deferred revenues totaling million offset in part by a decrease of million in accounts payable 
total deferred revenues  including both current and long term  increased by million to million at september  from million at september  this increase resulted from the growth in our customer base for our subscription services offerings over the period 
our common stock and additional paid in capital totaled million at september   compared to million at september   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to our repurchase of common stock during the fiscal year ended september  totaling million  offset in part by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options under our stock based compensation plans and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
liquidity and capital resources our available sources of liquidity as of september  consisted principally of cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we have a revolving credit line and equipment purchase facility available  which is discussed in more detail below 
our operating cash inflows consist of payments received from our subscription and license customers 
our operating cash outflows consist of employee salaries  payments to vendors directly related to subscription and license services  payments under arrangements with third parties who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with our subscription services offerings  related sales and marketing and administrative costs  and systems development and programming costs 
operating activities provided million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal compared to fiscal and was driven by additional profits from operating results and the million of lessor provided tenant improvements associated with the build out of our new facility 
our investing activities used million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and provided million in fiscal investing activities for fiscal also included the use of million of lessor provided tenant improvements associated with the build out of our new facility

table of contents as well as amounts capitalized for the development of software used internally  as described in more detail in results of operations expenses systems development and programming costs above 
our financing activities used million in fiscal and provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
proceeds from financing activities during these periods consisted mainly of cash received from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activities  which we do not directly control 
payments of million for the repurchase of common stock  as described in more detail below  comprised the majority of cash outflows from financing activities for fiscal scheduled payments made on loans of million and million accounted for the remaining cash outflows from financing activities for fiscal years and  respectively 
in september  we amended the terms of the loan agreement to add a revolving line of credit revolver in an amount not to exceed the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable or million  with interest at the bank s prime rate 
any advances under the revolver became due and payable on september  in september  we amended the loan agreement to extend the revolver s availability to june   at which time any advances became due and payable 
in may  we amended the loan agreement to extend the revolver s availability to may   at which time any advances become due and payable 
the other terms of the revolver remain the same 
there were no amounts borrowed under the revolver at september  we also amended the terms of the loan agreement in september to add an additional equipment facility term iii advance for advances in the amount of actual equipment purchases up to million through september  with interest at the bank s prime rate  maturing in september in september we amended the loan agreement to extend the term iii advance s availability to june   with any amounts borrowed due on june  the other terms of the term iii advance remain the same 
there were no amounts borrowed under the term iii advance at september  in may  we amended the terms of the loan agreement to add an additional equipment facility term iv advance for advances in the amount of actual equipment purchases up to million through may   with interest at the bank s prime rate  maturing on may  there were no amounts borrowed under the term iv advance at september  in march  we entered into an arrangement to finance the premium for our current directors and officers liability insurance policy 
the loan under this financing agreement bore interest at per annum and matured in december in january  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program  under which we were authorized to repurchase up to one million shares of our outstanding common stock over a two year period expiring in january we did not repurchase any shares under this program 
in january  our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program  under which we are authorized to repurchase up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock over a two year period expiring in january stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market based on market conditions 
any repurchases will be made at the then current market prices  and repurchased shares will be retired 
during the fiscal year ended september   we repurchased and retired  shares of our outstanding common stock under the repurchase program  leaving a balance of  shares remaining eligible for repurchase 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september  related to operating leases and purchase obligations payments due by period fiscal years contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total reflects future minimum commitments under arrangements with third parties who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with the provision of our subscription services offerings 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  amounts available under our equipment credit facilities and revolving line of credit  as well as expected positive operating cash flows  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for normal business operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in the longer term  or if we decide to acquire assets or businesses  we may require additional funds and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of debt or equity securities  or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements  or other available means 
there can be no assurances that any such funds will be available or  if available  will be on acceptable terms to meet our business needs 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  such estimates and judgments are periodically re evaluated 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 
the estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  internal use software  allowances for accounts receivable  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services which include software maintenance services  consulting services  and the sale of software licenses 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 

table of contents we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if collection is not considered probable  we recognize revenues when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenues as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgment as to the probability of collection and determinability of fees may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the acceptance period or satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria  as applicable 
in contractual arrangements that include the provision of multiple elements  we apply the accounting guidance most applicable to the specific arrangement to determine how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
multiple element arrangements require the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
generally  separate contracts with the same customer that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated together and  therefore  are accounted for as a single contractual arrangement in determining how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
typically  we measure and allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements based on their fair value or  if necessary  vendor specific objective evidence of their fair value vsoe 
vsoe is determined by the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price set by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change prior to separate market introduction 
subscription revenues our subscription revenues are typically recognized monthly as the service is provided to the customer and consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services  amortization of related set up fees  amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements  and the amortized portion of the related license and consulting fees in certain multiple element subscription arrangements where vsoe does not exist for an undelivered subscription element 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual lives  or the expected lives of the customer relationships  which generally range from two to five years 
for those subscription service offerings that have been commercially available for only a short period of time  the contractual lives are used as the best estimate of the expected lives of the customer relationships 
we continue to evaluate and adjust the length of these amortization periods as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals and contract cancellations 
it is possible that  in the future  the estimates of expected customer lives may change and  if so  the periods over which such subscription set up fees and costs are amortized will be adjusted 
any such change in estimated expected customer lives will affect our future results of operations 
software maintenance services include technical support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
fees for software maintenance services are typically billed 
table of contents annually in advance of performance of the services with provisions for subsequent automatic annual renewals 
we defer the related revenues and recognize them ratably over the respective maintenance terms  which typically are one year 
subscription revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
consulting revenues consulting revenues consist of fees for professional services  which consist of system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
consulting service fees are typically billed and recognized as revenue on a time and materials basis 
in some instances  we sell consulting services under milestone or fixed fee contracts and  in such cases  recognize consulting revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
consulting revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
in service arrangements that include consulting and subscription services  but not a license of our software  we recognize consulting revenues as they are performed if the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting within the arrangement 
the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting if they have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription services  and delivery or performance of the subscription services is considered probable and substantially within our control 
we have determined that  in our service arrangements of this type  the consulting services typically qualify as a separate unit of accounting and  accordingly  the consulting revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if the consulting services do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the related revenues are combined with the subscription revenues  and recognized ratably over the subscription service period 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
other revenues other revenues consist of fees earned from  and allocable to  grants of licenses to use our software products 
we recognize license revenues when evidence of a license arrangement exists  we have delivered the software  the amount of the transaction is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and vsoe exists for any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
elements included in our multiple element software arrangements consist of various licensed software products and services such as software maintenance services  consulting services  and subscription services 
in software license arrangements that include rights to multiple elements  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements using the residual method  under which revenues are allocated to undelivered elements based on vsoe and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered elements 
if sufficient vsoe does not exist for the allocation of revenue to the various elements of the arrangement  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
if the only undelivered element is software maintenance  the entire fee is recognized ratably as subscription revenue 
we are required to exercise judgment in deciding how to interpret the evidence of fair value to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration with respect to a given element  and in determining whether an established price is likely to change prior to separate market introduction 
these judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
in software license arrangements where we also provide consulting services  license revenues are recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that the criteria for recognition of software license revenues 
table of contents described above are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
if we determine that the consulting services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees is dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  then both the license and consulting fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
we typically do not consider the consulting services we provide in such arrangements to be essential to the functionality of the software and  therefore  license revenues are typically recognized upon delivery of the software and consulting revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
accordingly  our judgment as to whether consulting services should be considered essential to the functionality of the licensed software may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
in arrangements where we license our software and also host the licensed software for our customer  a software element is only considered present if our customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and it is feasible for our customer to either operate the software on its own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software 
if the arrangement meets these criteria  as well as the other criteria for recognition of license revenues described above  we deem there to be software element present and recognize license revenues when the software is delivered  and we recognize the subscription hosting revenues as the hosting service is provided 
hosting set up fees for such arrangements  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  are deferred and recognized ratably over the hosting service period 
if we determine that a separate software element as described above is not present  we combine the software license fees with the subscription hosting fees and recognize them ratably over the subscription service period  as subscription revenue 
our judgment as to whether we meet the criteria above could have a material affect on the timing and mix of our revenue recognition and on our results of operations 
portions of our revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners 
when we assume a majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations  we record the revenues on a gross basis  and amounts paid to our reseller partners are recognized as cost of operations 
our assumption of such business risks is evidenced when  among other things  we take responsibility for delivery of the product or service  establish pricing of the arrangement  and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
when our reseller partner assumes the majority of the business risks associated with the performance of the contractual obligations  we record the associated revenues net of the amounts paid to our reseller partner 
our judgment as to whether we have assumed the majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations materially affects how we report revenues and cost of operations 
internal use software we capitalize certain costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with aicpa sop  accounting for the costs of corporate software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
we capitalize software development costs when application development begins and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended 
costs associated with preliminary project stage activities  training  maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred 
our policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects  as well as external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use software 
capitalizable personnel costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects 
capitalized costs are ratably amortized  using the straight line method  over the estimated useful lives of the related applications which typically range from three to five years 
our judgment as to which costs to capitalize  when to begin capitalizing such costs  and what period to amortize the costs over  may materially affect our results of operations 
accounts receivable allowances we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against subscription and consulting revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we record our sales allowances based on historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 

table of contents we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables  and we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  included in general and administrative expenses 
in estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  we consider specific receivables when collection is doubtful  as well as an analysis of our historical bad debt experience and the current economic environment 
if the data used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not adequately reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
stock based compensation we have elected to continue to account for our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as opposed to the fair value method allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
accordingly  no stock based compensation cost has been reflected in our statement of operations for any of the periods presented  as all options granted under these plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  and any purchase discounts under our employee stock purchase plan were within statutory limits 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements  with the cost measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we are required to apply sfas r as of the first annual reporting period that begins after june   therefore  we will adopt the new requirements beginning with our fiscal as a result  we expect to record non cash  stock based compensation expense  which will have a material effect on our results of operations 
for example  in the fiscal year ended september   had we accounted for stock based compensation using a fair value method of accounting as defined by the currently effective guidance under sfas  our net income would have been reduced by million 
we are studying the specific impact of adoption  which includes our decision of whether to adopt the requirements on a prospective or retrospective basis and the specific methods for valuation see note to our financial statements included herein 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
such judgments can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we have experienced significant operating losses to date  as well as assumed significant net operating loss carryforwards from acquisitions  both of which have resulted in significant net deferred tax assets 
the relatively short history with our new subscription model makes our future taxable position difficult to evaluate 
therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to these deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until the point at which we believe their utilization is more likely than not 
in the event we begin to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards and we determine it is more likely than not we will be able to do so  an adjustment to our valuation allowance would be recorded and may result in a reduction to goodwill  and or the recording of a significant tax benefit  which would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
depending on the amount of deferred tax assets that may be realized  and depending on whether we incur taxable profits in the periods following the recognition of any tax benefit  we may record tax expense in these subsequent periods 
any recorded tax expense would result in minimal actual tax payments until the point at which we fully utilized our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards  which are subject to the limitations and timing as described below 
as a result of prior equity financings and the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions  we have incurred ownership changes  as defined by applicable tax laws 
as a result  our use of the acquired net operating 
table of contents loss carryforwards may be limited 
further  to the extent that any single year loss is not utilized to the full amount of the limitation  such unused loss is carried over to subsequent years until the earlier of its utilization or the expiration of the relevant carryforward period 
our net operating loss carryforwards may extend to a period of greater than years  subject to limitations and timing as prescribed by applicable tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
interest rate risk 
we have borrowing arrangements with variable rates of interest 
there are no amounts outstanding at september  under such arrangements 
we also maintain cash in highly liquid investment vehicles including money market accounts  which bear interest at variable overnight or short term rates 
variable interest rate investment and debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows related to these investment and debt arrangements 
foreign currency risk 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk 
derivatives 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
