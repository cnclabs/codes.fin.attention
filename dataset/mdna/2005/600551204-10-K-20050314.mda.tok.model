item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may be deemed to be forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are made based on our management s belief as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  our management pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements due to  among other things  the factors set forth below  and  in particular  the risks associated with the terms and pending maturity of our substantial indebtedness 
such factors are not exclusive 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time by  or on behalf of  our company 
the need to service our high level of indebtedness may affect the growth and profitability of our business 
as of january  our debt included approximately million under our senior credit facility and million under our junior credit facility 
as a consequence  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations  as well as from sales of our distributorships  has been and will continue to be dedicated to service this debt 
using cash in this manner may affect our ability to grow our business and to take advantage of opportunities for growth 
in addition  this substantial indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
the requirements and restrictions imposed by our credit facilities restrict our ability to operate our business  and failure to comply with these requirements and restrictions could adversely affect our business 
the terms of our senior and junior credit facilities restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  incur liens  or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or their assets 
our credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial tests  and to comply with certain other reporting  affirmative and negative covenants 
we have experienced difficulties meeting these financial tests in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
if we fail to comply with the requirements of either of our credit facilities  such non compliance would result in an event of default 
if not waived by the lending groups  such event of default would result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the respective credit facility  and may permit our lenders to foreclose on our assets that secure the credit facilities 
our credit facilities mature soon  and our inability to fully repay  or to refinance or extend the final maturity dates of  either of these facilities may adversely affect our business or cause us to seek bankruptcy court or other protection from our creditors 
our senior credit facility is scheduled to mature in july  and our junior credit facility matures in january we will be required to fully repay  or to refinance or extend the maturity dates of  both of these credit facilities when they mature 
we have been granted an option  exercisable through july   to extend the maturity date of our senior credit facility until july  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully repay  or to refinance or further extend  either of these credit facilities when they finally mature 
we currently are engaged in negotiations regarding refinancing our senior credit facility  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transaction on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if we fail to repay  when due  our obligations under either credit facility  such failure would result in an event of default under such facility 
under these circumstances  we could be required to find alternative funding sources or sell assets  and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such alternative funding or that we would be able to sell assets on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we were unable to secure alternative funding or sell assets  we might be required to seek bankruptcy court or other protection from our creditors 
our ability to service our credit facilities may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
because of the amount of obligations outstanding under our credit facilities and the connection of the interest rate under each facility including the default rates to the prime rate  an increase in the prime rate could have a significant effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations under the credit facilities and increase our interest expense significantly 
therefore  our liquidity and access to capital resources could be further affected by increasing interest rates 
we are subject to certain retained liabilities related to the wind down of our towing services operations 
we sold or closed all remaining towing services businesses during as a result  almost all of our former towing services businesses now operate under new ownership  and in general the customary operating liabilities of these businesses were assumed by the new owners 
our subsidiaries that sold these businesses are subject to some continuing liabilities with respect to their pre sale operations  including  for example  liabilities related to litigation  certain trade payables  workers compensation and other insurance  surety bonds  and real estate  and miller industries is subject to some of such continuing liabilities by virtue of certain direct parent guarantees 
it is possible that our towing services segment will not have assets sufficient to satisfy these continuing liabilities 
our business is subject to the cyclical nature of our industry  general economic conditions and weather 
adverse changes with respect to any of these factors may lead to a downturn in our business 
the towing and recovery industry is cyclical in nature and has been affected historically by high interest rates  insurance costs  and economic conditions in general 
accordingly  a downturn in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our operations  as was the case during the recent general economic downturn 
the industry also is influenced by consumer confidence and general credit availability  and by weather conditions  none of which is within our control 
our dependence upon outside suppliers for our raw materials  including steel  and other purchased component parts  leaves us subject to price increases and delays in receiving supplies of such materials or parts 
we are dependent upon outside suppliers for our raw material needs and other purchased component parts  and although we believe that these suppliers will continue to meet our requirements and specifications  and that alternative sources of supply are available  events beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the cost or availability of raw materials and component parts 
shipment delays  unexpected price increases or changes in payment terms from our suppliers of raw materials or component parts could impact our ability to secure necessary raw materials or component parts  or to secure such materials and parts at favorable prices 
for example  recent increases in foreign demand for steel  as well as disruptions in the supply of raw materials  has caused a lack of domestic availability for certain types of steel  and has resulted in substantially higher prices for steel and raw materials with high steel content 
partially to offset these increases  we implemented general price increases in and  and steel cost surcharges in while we have attempted to pass these increased costs on to our customers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so 
additionally  demand for our products could be negatively affected by the unavailability of truck chassis  which are manufactured by third parties and are frequently supplied by us  or are purchased separately by our distributors or by towing operators 
although we believe that sources of our raw materials and component parts will continue to be adequate to meet our requirements and that alternative sources are available  shortages  price increases or delays in shipments of our raw materials and component parts could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance  competitive position and reputation 
our international operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results  including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuation 
a significant portion of our net sales and production in were outside the united states  primarily in europe 
as a result  our operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties  including risks of restrictive taxation policies  changing political conditions and governmental regulations 
also  a substantial portion of our net sales derived outside the united states  as well as salaries of employees located outside the united states and certain other expenses  are denominated in foreign currencies  including british pounds and the euro 
we are subject to risk of financial loss resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the us dollar 
our competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers  or attract current customers away from us 
the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive 
competition for sales exists at both the distributor and towing operator levels and is based primarily on product quality and innovation  reputation  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
in addition  sales of our products are affected by the market for used towing and recovery equipment 
certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than us 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technology 
historically  we have been able to develop or acquire patented and other proprietary product innovations which have allowed us to produce what management believes to be technologically advanced products relative to most of our competition 
certain of our patents have expired  and others will expire in the next few years  and as a result  we may not have a continuing competitive advantage through proprietary products and technology 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of a consent judgment entered into in with the antitrust division of the us department of justice  we are required to offer non exclusive royalty bearing licenses to certain of our key patents to all wrecker and car carrier manufacturers 
our historical market position has been a result  in part  of our continuous efforts to develop new products 
our future success and ability to maintain market share will depend  to an extent  on new product development 
we depend upon skilled labor to manufacture our products 
if we experience problems hiring and retaining skilled labor  our business may be negatively affected 
the timely production of our wreckers and car carriers requires an adequate supply of skilled labor  and the operating costs of our manufacturing facilities can be adversely affected by high turnover in skilled positions 
accordingly  our ability to increase sales  productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to employ the skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities 
in addition  in connection with a representation petition filed by the united auto workers union with the national labor relations board  a vote was held on union representation for employees at our ooltewah  tennessee manufacturing plant in these employees voted against joining the united auto workers union  but the vote was subsequently overturned by the national labor relations board 
thereafter  a new vote was scheduled for february  but this vote was cancelled at the request of the united auto workers union 
while our employees are not currently members of a union  there can be no assurance that the employees at our ooltewah manufacturing plant  or any other of our employees  may not choose to become unionized in the future 
if our common stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange the market for our common stock may be substantially less active and it may impair the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell our common stock 
in june  we received notification from the new york stock exchange that we were not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards because we did not have sufficient shareholders equity or an adequate day average market capitalization 
in response  we implemented a plan for regaining compliance with the continued listing standards which focused on restructuring our bank facilities and rationalizing the timing of our debt service  disposing of our remaining roadone and distributor operations  and returning our manufacturing operations to their historically profitable levels 
in december  the nyse notified us that  as a result of our compliance plan  we had regained compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards and had been approved as a company in good standing with the nyse 
as of december   our shareholders equity was million and our day average market capitalization was million 
as a condition to the nyse s approval  we are subject to a month follow up period with the nyse to ensure continued compliance with the continued listing standards  and will be subject to the nyse s routine monitoring procedures 
if we are unable to comply with the nyse s continued listing standards during this follow up period  or thereafter  our common stock could be delisted from the new york stock exchange 
if our common stock is delisted  it is likely that the trading market for our common stock would be substantially less active  and the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell shares of our common stock would be materially impaired 
in addition  the delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to enter into future equity financing transactions 
in the event that our stock is delisted from the new york stock exchange  we would pursue listing on an alternative national securities exchange or association 
any loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team 
the loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us 
a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage  or an inability to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
we are subject to various claims  including automobile and product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business  and may at times be a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business 
we maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience 
a successful product liability or other claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  or the inability of us to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
continued increases in our customers fuel costs  and the reduced availability of credit for our customers  will have a material effect upon our business 
as a result of the events of september  and other general economic factors  our customers have experienced substantial increases in fuel and other transportation costs 
there can be no assurance that fuel and transportation costs will not continue to increase for our customers in the future 
additionally  our customers have experienced  and continue to experience  reduced availability of credit  which negatively affects their ability to  and capacity for  purchasing equipment 
these increases in fuel and transportation costs  and these reductions in the availability of credit  have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on our customers  and a material effect upon our business and operating results 
our stock price may fluctuate greatly as a result of the general volatility of the stock market 
from time to time  there may be significant volatility in the market price for our common sock 
our quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimated by analysts  changes in general conditions in our industry or the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
our chairman and co chief executive officer owns a substantial interest in our common stock 
he may vote his shares in ways with which you disagree 
william g 
miller  our chairman  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  mr 
miller has the ability to exert significant influence over our business affairs  including the ability to influence the election of directors and the result of voting on all matters requiring shareholder approval 
our charter and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive to acquire us in the future or may negatively affect our stock price 
our charter and bylaws contain restrictions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us  including  without limitation  prohibitions on shareholder action by written consent and advance notice requirements respecting amendments to certain provisions of our charter and bylaws 
in addition  our charter authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
the rights and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors  in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval  and the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock

executive overview miller industries  inc is the world s largest manufacturer of vehicle towing and recovery equipment  with domestic manufacturing subsidiaries in tennessee and pennsylvania  and foreign manufacturing subsidiaries in france and the united kingdom 
we offer a broad range of equipment to meet our customer s design  capacity and cost requirements under our century  vulcan  challenger  holmes  champion  chevron  eagle  titan  jige and boniface brand names 
overall  our management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor our operating and financial performance 
these indicators include measurements of revenue  operating income  gross margin  income from continuing operations  earnings per share  capital expenditures and cash flow 
we derive revenues primarily from product sales made through our network of domestic and foreign independent distributors 
our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors  such as demand for  and price of  our products  our technological competitiveness  our reputation for providing quality products and reliable service  competition within our industry  the cost of raw materials including steel and general economic conditions 
during  our revenues were positively affected by a general increase in demand for our products resulting from general economic improvements 
in addition  we commenced the manufacture of heavy duty towing and recovery units for the australian military as part of the largest single order for towing and recovery equipment in our history 
the first units under this contract were delivered in late  and the remaining units are scheduled for production and delivery through mid we also began a project with datapath  inc to assist in the design and engineering of mobile communications trailers for military application 
we completed an initial order of trailers in  and will begin the manufacture of up to an additional trailers during the first half of as a result of these projects  as well as the general increase in demand for our products  we have a strong backlog that we expect to carry into we have been and will continue to be affected by recent large increases in the prices that we pay for steel and components with high steel content 
like all manufactures  we have experienced shortages in the availability of steel 
steel costs represent a substantial part of our total costs of operations  and management expects steel prices to remain at historically high levels for the foreseeable future 
partially to offset these increases  we implemented a steel cost surcharge of in january  and in august  we implemented another general price increase of approximately  and increased our steel cost surcharge amount 
we also began to develop alternatives to the steel and steel components that we use in our production process  and have introduced several of these alternatives to our major component part suppliers 
over the coming years we will continue to monitor steel prices and availability in order to more favorably position ourselves in this dynamic market 
management also continues to focus on reducing the overall debt levels under our senior and junior credit facilities 
in  approximately million of subordinated debt and warrants was exchanged and converted into shares of our common stock 
in addition  during  cash proceeds from the private placement of  shares of our common stock were used to retire significant portions of our subordinated debt 
while our debt levels have declined significantly over the past year  our senior credit facility is scheduled to mature in july  and our junior credit facility matures on january  we have been granted an option  exercisable through july   to extend the maturity date of our senior credit facility until july we will be required to repay  refinance or further extend the maturity dates of these facilities when they finally mature 
management currently is engaged in negotiations that would result in a longer term or new senior credit facility 
also during  we substantially completed our strategic goal of disposing of towing services businesses and distributor operations 
as a result  at december   only miscellaneous assets remained in the roadone towing services segment and only one distributor location remained in our distribution group 
as a result  our management team has renewed its focus on our core business the manufacture of towing and recovery equipment 
compliance with new york stock exchange continued listing standards in june  we received notification from the new york stock exchange that we were not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards because we did not have sufficient shareholders equity or an adequate day average market capitalization 
in response  we implemented a plan for regaining compliance with the continued listing standards which focused on restructuring our bank facilities and rationalizing the timing of our debt service  disposing of our remaining roadone and distributor operations  and returning our manufacturing operations to their historically profitable levels 
with the approval by our shareholders of the conversion of a portion of our subordinated debt into our common stock  we completed the restructuring of our bank facilities 
we also disposed of the remainder of our roadone operations and are in the process of disposing of our remaining distributor location 
in december  the nyse notified us that  as a result of our compliance plan  we had regained compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards and had been approved as a company in good standing with the nyse 
as a condition to the nyse s approval  we are subject to a month follow up period with the nyse to ensure continued compliance with the continued listing standards  and will be subject to the nyse s routine monitoring procedures 
as of december   our shareholders equity was million and our day average market capitalization was million 
discontinued operations during  our management and board of directors made the decision to divest of our towing services segment  as well as the operations of the distribution group of our towing and recovery equipment segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets of the towing services segment and the distribution group are considered a disposal group and the assets are no longer being depreciated 
all assets and liabilities and results of operations associated with these assets have been separately presented in the accompanying financial statements 
the statements of operations and related financial statement disclosures for all prior years have been restated to present the towing services segment and the distribution group as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations 
the analyses contained herein are of continuing operations  as restated  unless otherwise noted 
the results of operations and loss on disposal associated with certain towing services operations  which were sold in june have been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations given our significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposal components via a consulting agreement and our ongoing interest in the cash flows of the operations of the disposal components via a long term license agreement 
income taxes differences between the effective tax rate and the expected tax rate are due primarily to changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances for and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical  as they require management s highest degree of judgment  estimates and assumptions 
a discussion of critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions follows accounts receivable we extend credit to customers in the normal course of business 
collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
while such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
when a determination has been made that the carrying amount of long lived assets and goodwill may not be fully recovered  the amount of impairment is measured by comparing an asset s estimated fair value to its carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management  or if available independent appraisals or sales price negotiations 
the estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue  operating costs  interest rates  property and equipment additions  and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  changes in any of these factors could affect these evaluations 
upon adoption of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of goodwill in and have continued to perform annual impairment reviews thereafter 
for further detail of our impairment review and related write downs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
warranty reserves we estimate expense for product warranty claims at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
we review trends of warranty claims and take actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
we believe the warranty reserve is adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider tax loss carrybacks  reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning and estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we currently have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets from continuing and discontinuing operations 
the allowance reflects our recognition that continuing tax losses from operations and certain liquidity matters indicate that it is unclear whether certain future tax benefits will be realized through future taxable income 
the balance of the valuation allowance was million at december  and million at december  revenues under our accounting policies  sales are recorded when equipment is shipped to independent distributors or other customers 
while we manufacture only the bodies of wreckers  which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties  we frequently purchase the truck chassis for resale to our customers 
sales of company purchased truck chassis are included in net sales 
margins are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles containing company purchased chassis because the markup over the cost of the chassis is nominal 
revenue from our owned distributors is recorded at the time equipment is shipped to customers or services are rendered 
the towing services division recognizes revenue at the time services are performed 
seasonality our towing and recovery equipment segment has experienced some seasonality in net sales due in part to decisions by purchasers of light duty wreckers to defer wrecker purchases near the end of the chassis model year 
the segment s net sales have historically been seasonally impacted due in part to weather conditions 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency 
the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  historical rates for equity and the weighted average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the gains or losses resulting from such translations are included in shareholders equity

credit facilities senior credit facility in july  we entered into a four year senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing credit facility 
our senior credit facility has been amended several times 
the current lenders under our senior credit facility are william g 
miller  our chairman of the board and co chief executive officer  and cit group business credit  inc  with mr 
miller s portion of the loan being subordinated to that of cit 
as discussed in further detail below  the senior credit facility is scheduled to mature in july  but we have been granted an option  exercisable through july   to extend the maturity date to july currently  our senior credit facility consists of an aggregate million credit facility  including a million revolving loan  a million term loan and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility provides for separate and distinct loan commitment levels for our towing and recovery equipment segment and roadone segment  respectively 
borrowing availability under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility is based on a percentage of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable determined on eligibility criteria set forth in the credit facility and is subject to a maximum borrowing limitation 
borrowings under the term loans are collateralized by substantially all of our property  plants  and equipment 
we are required to make monthly amortization payments of  on the first term loan  but the amortization payments due on november   december   and january  were deferred until the maturity date 
the senior credit facility bears interest at the prime rate as defined plus  subject to the rights of the senior lender agent or a majority of the lenders to charge a default rate equal to the prime rate as defined plus during the continuance of any event of default thereunder 
the senior credit facility contains requirements relating to maintaining minimum excess availability at all times and minimum monthly levels of earnings before income taxes and depreciation and amortization as defined based on the most recently ended trailing three month period 
in addition  the senior credit facility contains restrictions on capital expenditures  incurrence of indebtedness  mergers and acquisitions  distributions and transfers and sales of assets 
the senior credit facility also contains requirements related to weekly and monthly collateral reporting 
junior credit facility our junior credit facility is  by its terms  expressly subordinated only to our senior credit facility  and is secured by certain specified assets and by a second priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our other assets 
as amended  the junior credit facility contains requirements for the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
it also imposes restriction on capital expenditures  incurrence of indebtedness  mergers and acquisitions  distributions and transfers and sales of assets 
contrarian funds  llc purchased all of the outstanding debt of the junior credit facility in a series of transactions during the second half of as part of its purchase  contrarian also purchased warrants for shares of our common stock  which were subsequently exchanged for shares of our common stock as described in further detail below 
in november  harbourside investments  lllp purchased of the subordinated debt and warrants from contrarian 
as described in further detail below under the heading and amendments and restructuring in february  contrarian and harbourside finalized the conversion of approximately million in subordinated debt for our common stock 
in connection with this purchase and restructuring of our debt  the junior credit facility was amended to  among other things  extend its maturity date and bear interest at an effective blended rate of in may we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to a small group of unaffiliated private investors 
the proceeds of this sale  together with additional borrowings under our senior credit facility  were used to retire approximately million principal amount of our junior credit facility  and approximately  of accrued interest on such debt 
our remaining junior credit facility obligations consist of approximately million principal amount bearing interest at an annual rate of 
on november   our junior credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to january  maturity of credit facilities our senior credit facility is scheduled to mature in july  and our junior credit facility matures in january we will be required to repay  refinance or extend the maturity dates of these facilities when they mature 
we have been granted an option  exercisable through july   to extend the maturity date of our senior credit facility until july  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to repay  refinance or further amend either of our credit facilities when they finally mature 
we currently are engaged in negotiations regarding a transaction that would result in a longer term senior credit facility  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transaction on satisfactory terms  if at all 
interest rate sensitivity because of the amount of obligations outstanding under our credit facilities and the connection of the interest rate under each facility including the default rates to the prime rate  an increase in the prime rate could have a significant effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations under the credit facilities and increase our interest expense significantly 
therefore  our liquidity and access to capital resources could be further affected by increasing interest rates 
prior default of credit facilities our failure to repay all outstanding principal  interest and any other amounts due and owing under our junior credit facility at its original july  maturity date constituted an event of default under our junior credit facility and also triggered an event of default under the cross default provisions of our senior credit facility 
additionally  we were in default of the ebitda covenant under the junior credit facility for the first quarter of calendar we also were in default under both the senior and junior credit facilities as a result of the going concern explanatory paragraph included in the report of our prior independent auditor which going concern qualification was removed  and an unqualified report subsequently delivered  in connection with the recent re audit of our financial statements by our current independent auditor as well as our failure to file our annual report for the fiscal year ended december  prior to april  pursuant to the terms of the intercreditor agreement between the then existing senior and junior lenders  the junior lender agent and the junior lenders were prevented from taking any enforcement action or exercising any remedies against us  our subsidiaries or our respective assets as a result of such events of default during a standstill period 
on july   the junior lender agent gave a notice of enforcement to the senior lender agent based upon the event of default for failure to repay the outstanding obligations under the junior credit facility on the junior credit facility s maturity date 
on august   the senior agent gave a payment blockage notice to the junior agent based upon certain events of default under the senior credit facility  thereby preventing the junior agent and junior lenders from receiving any payments from us in respect of the junior credit facility while such blockage notice remains in effect 
and amendments and restructuring on october   we entered into a forbearance agreement with the then existing lenders and the senior lender agent under our senior credit facility  pursuant to which  among other things  the senior lenders agreed to forbear from exercising any remedies in respect of the defaults then existing under the senior credit facility as a result of i our failure to timely deliver financial statements for fiscal year and our failure to deliver a report of our independent certified public accountants which is unqualified in any respect  as well as the event of default under the senior credit facility caused by the event of default arising from such failure under the junior credit facility  ii our failure to fulfill certain payment obligations to the junior lenders under the junior credit facility  and iii our failure to fulfill certain financial covenants in the junior credit facility for one or more of the fiscal quarters ending in fiscal year  which failure would constitute an event of default under the senior credit facility 
the forbearance period under the forbearance agreement was to expire on the earlier of x december   y the occurrence of certain bankruptcy type events in respect of us or any of our subsidiaries  and z the failure by us or any of our subsidiaries that are borrower parties under the senior credit facility to perform the obligations under the senior credit facility or the forbearance agreement 
under the forbearance agreement  the senior lenders and the senior lender agent did not waive their rights and remedies with respect to the existing senior facility defaults  but agreed to forbear from exercising rights and remedies with respect to the existing senior facility defaults solely during the forbearance period 
simultaneous with entering into the forbearance agreement  william g 
miller  our chairman of the board and co chief executive officer  made a million loan to us as a part of the senior credit facility 
the loan and mr 
miller s participation in the senior credit facility were effected by the seventh amendment to the credit agreement and a participation agreement between mr 
miller and the senior credit facility lenders 
on december   mr 
miller increased his previous million participation in the existing senior credit facility by an additional million 
these funds  along with additional funds from the cit group business credit  inc  an existing senior lender  were used to satisfy the obligations to two of the other existing senior lenders 
this transaction resulted in cit and mr 
miller constituting the senior lenders to us  with cit holding of such loan and mr 
miller participating in of the commitment 
mr 
miller s portion of the loan is subordinated to that of cit 
in conjunction with mr 
miller s increased participation  the senior credit facility was restructured and restated as a million revolving facility and million and million term loans 
as a result of this restructuring  all previously existing defaults under the senior credit facility were waived  the interest rate was lowered by to reflect a non default rate  fees attributable to roadone of  per month were eliminated  the financial covenants were substantially relaxed  and availability under the senior credit facility was increased by approximately million 
the senior lending group  consisting of cit and mr 
miller  earned fees of  in connection with the restructuring  including previously unpaid fees of  for the earlier forbearance agreement through december  and  for the restructuring of the loans described above 
of these fees   were paid to mr 
miller and the remainder  were paid to cit 
in addition  we will pay additional interest at a rate of on mr 
miller s portion of the loan  which is in recognition of the fact that mr 
miller s rights to payments and collateral are subordinate to those of cit 
this transaction was approved by the special committee of the board  as well as the full board of directors  with mr 
miller abstaining due to his personal interest in the transaction 
in order to enter into this restructuring of the senior credit facility  cit required that the junior lenders agree to extend the standstill and payment blockage periods  which were to expire at the end of april  until july   which is after the current july  maturity of the senior debt 
the junior facility lenders were unwilling to extend such standstill and payment blockage dates without the conversion provisions described above having been committed to by us  subject only to shareholder approval of the conversion by harbourside 
as a result  the restructuring of the senior debt facility and the conversion and exchange of subordinated debt and warrants described above were cross conditioned upon each other and agreements effecting them were entered into simultaneously on december  to effectuate the conversion and exchange of the subordinated debt and warrants  we entered into a binding restructuring agreement with contrarian and harbourside on december  under this agreement  contrarian and harbourside agreed to an exchange transaction where they would extend the maturity date of of the outstanding principal amount of the junior debt  approximately million  convert the remaining of the outstanding principal  plus all accrued interest and fees  into our common stock and convert their warrants into our common stock 
this agreement contemplated that the conversions would be further documented in separate exchange agreements and also contemplated registration rights agreements 
the binding restructuring agreement also outlined the terms for amending the junior credit facility to extend its maturity date to july  which is after the july  maturity date of the senior credit facility  to provide for an interest rate on the remaining debt of contrarian at and the remaining debt of harbourside at a reduced rate which was ultimately agreed to be  to provide for financial covenants that match those of the senior credit facility and to make other amendments to the junior credit facility consistent with amendments made to the senior credit facility as it was amended on december  the disparity in the interest rates to be earned by contrarian and harbourside is caused by contrarian negotiating an interest rate of as a condition to it entering into the binding restructuring agreement  as a result of which harbourside agreed to reduce the rate to be received by it to so that we would continue to pay an effective blended interest rate of on the aggregate of the subordinated debt following the exchange transactions 
at the same time  contrarian and harbourside entered into an agreement with the senior lenders to extend the maturity date of the subordinated debt that they would continue to hold 
as of january   we entered into separate exchange agreements with contrarian and harbourside  a registration rights agreement with contrarian and harbourside and an amendment to the junior credit facility with contrarian and harbourside  all as contemplated in the binding restructuring agreement 
under the amendment to the junior credit facility  the maturity of the remaining subordinated debt was extended and the interest rates thereon were altered and the financial covenants were amended to match those in the senior credit facility  which had been substantially relaxed in our favor on december  outstanding borrowings outstanding borrowings under the senior and junior credit facilities as of december  and were as follows in thousands senior credit facility manufacturing road one term loan total junior credit facility total outstanding borrowings the substantial reductions in our overall indebtedness reflected above were due to a number of factors  including improved operating cash flow resulting from cost reductions and expense controls  the conversion of a portion of such indebtedness to shares of our common stock  and proceeds generated from the may private placement of shares of our common stock 
in addition  dispositions of roadone assets and distribution group operations improved liquidity and generated proceeds and reduced expenses  which were used to further reduce debt

special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
in october  we obtained interest rate swaps as required by terms in our senior credit facility to hedge exposure to market fluctuations 
the interest rate swaps covered million in notional amounts of variable rate debt and with fixed rates ranging from to 
the swaps expired annually from october to october upon expiration of these hedges  the amount recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings as interest 
in  the borrowing base was converted from libor to prime  which rendered the swap ineffective as a hedge 
accordingly  concurrent with the conversion we prematurely terminated the swap in at a cost of  the resulting loss was recorded in other comprehensive loss at december  and reclassified to earnings as interest expense over the term of our senior credit facility 
our junior credit facility contains provisions for the issuance of warrants of up to of the outstanding shares of our common stock in july and up to an additional in july the warrants were valued as of july based on the relative fair value using the black scholes model with the following assumptions risk free rate of estimated life of years  volatility and no dividend yield
