results of operations for and reflect the effects of the services agreement and the reinsurance pooling agreement among the company  its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  mnh  and mutual  effective january  the services agreement calls for mutual to provide underwriting  administrative  claims and investment services to the company and mnh 
the reinsurance pooling agreement provides for the pooling  or sharing  of insurance business traditionally written by mutual and mnh on or after the effective date 
mnh s share of pooled combined mutual and mnh premiums earned and losses and loss adjustment expenses lae for and in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement was and  respectively 
the reinsurance pooling agreement pertains to premiums earned and incurred losses and lae 
direct premiums written by mnh or mutual are not pooled 
mnh s pooling percentage will be in  though not to exceed  in assumed net written premiums 
mnh s share of pooled premiums will be reduced to in and  though not to exceed  and  in net written premiums  respectively 
total combined mutual and mnh or group wide direct premiums written dwp for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  in the company s pro forma share of combined direct premiums written in  in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement  was  compared to  in the table below shows a comparison of direct premiums written by major category in and mnh pro forma group wide dwp share year ended year ended december  december  variance variance s omitted s omitted voluntary personal lines     voluntary commercial lines     umbrella program     involuntary     total direct written premiums     the or  decrease in group wide voluntary personal lines direct premiums written resulted from a decrease in private passenger automobile ppa direct premiums written and a decrease in homeowners direct premiums written 
the decrease in ppa direct premiums written is the result of the companies decision  implemented in  not to write new policies in certain jurisdictions and from the approval of the companies plan to withdraw from the new jersey ppa market by the new jersey department of banking and insurance  which was effective in june as a result  voluntary ppa policies in force at december  were  a decrease of  or  from  at december  mutual introduced a monoline commercial umbrella program in the fourth quarter of the umbrella program 
the umbrella program is marketed exclusively through one independent agent and approximately of the premiums related to umbrella program policies are reinsured with an a rated national reinsurer through a quota share reinsurance treaty 
group wide voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written were  an increase of  or  from  in this increase resulted from period to period increases in every significant group wide commercial line of business 
the average premium per group wide  non umbrella program commercial lines policy increased from the year earlier period 
total non umbrella program commercial lines policies in force at december  were  an increase of from  at december  the decrease in group wide involuntary direct premiums written resulted primarily from a decrease in assignments from the new york automobile insurance plan nyaip 
direct premiums written related to policies assigned from the nyaip decreased to  for from  for the nyaip provides coverage for individuals who are unable to obtain auto insurance in the voluntary market 
assignments from the nyaip vary depending upon a company s ppa market share and the size the nyaip 
the company is unable to predict the volume of future assignments from the nyaip 
in order to minimize the adverse impact of assignments from the nyaip  the company purchased territorial credits from an unaffiliated company pursuant to section a of the nyaip manual 
the credits against nyaip assignments were generated by the other insurance company for writing ppa business in certain localities in new york with ppa market availability problems 
the other insurance company  by nature of its concentration in ppa business in credit territories  generated more credits than it required to offset its nyaip assignments 
the credits purchased reduced the company s share of the nyaip 
the credits purchased decreased direct premiums written related to nyaip assignments during by approximately  and by approximately  for group wide pooled net premiums written for were  an increase of  or  from  for this increase resulted from the increase in group wide direct premiums written  offset by an increase in as compared to of reinsurance premiums ceded to third parties  primarily for premiums written related to the umbrella program 
the company s share of pooled net premiums written in in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement was  a decrease of  or from  in this decrease resulted primarily from the percentage point decrease in the company s participation in the reinsurance pooling agreement 
total revenues for were  a decrease of  or  from  in the company s share of pooled net premiums earned in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement for was  the company s share of net premiums earned in were  this  or  decrease in net premiums earned primarily resulted from the percentage point decrease in the company s participation in the reinsurance pooling agreement

net investment losses were  
per fully diluted share after taxes in compared to  of net investment gains 
per fully diluted share after taxes in the amount included an aggregate  of investment losses related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of two investment securities owned by the company at december  the amount related primarily to the sale of an otherwise illiquid security to its issuer through a share repurchase program 
other revenues were  in  an increase of  or from  in  primarily due to a  decrease in premium receivable charge offs 
net losses and lae were  for  a decrease of  or from  for the decrease in net losses and lae was due to the decrease in net premiums earned and a percentage point decrease in the loss and lae ratio to in from in the company recorded decreases to its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years of  and  in and  respectively 
these decreases in losses and lae relating to prior accident years reduced the loss and lae ratio in and by and 
percentage points  respectively 
the following table documents the changes in the estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years recorded in for the company s major lines of business commercial workers accident home ppa auto compen commercial general all year owners liability liability sation package liability other total increases decreases in thousands prior to total    the company s reduction in its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years represented less than of the recorded reserve for losses and lae at december  during  both paid and incurred losses and lae emerged at amounts that were greater than anticipated when reserves for loss and lae were estimated and recorded at december  for the commercial package line of business 
this unfavorable emergence was offset by lower than anticipated loss and lae emergence in the company s ppa liability particularly for accidents occurring in and workers compensation lines of business 
the company made no changes to the key assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of its reserves for losses and lae during a reasonable possibility exists in any year that relatively minor fluctuations in the estimate of reserves for losses and lae may have a significant impact on the company s net income 
this is due primarily to the size of the company s reserves for losses and lae  at december  relative to its net income 
involuntary automobile insurance business increased the company s calendar year loss and lae ratio by approximately 
and percentage points for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned increased to for from for a  or  decrease in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was more than offset by a  or increase in other underwriting expenses 
other underwriting expenses included  percentage points of the expense ratio of retrospective commission expense related to the reinsurance pooling agreement which provides for retrospective commission income or expense based on actual experience compared to a targeted loss and lae ratio 
the commission is owed to mutual based on a decrease during in the estimated cumulative loss and lae ratio on the pooled business since the inception of the reinsurance pooling agreement 
during the company recorded  of retrospective commission income related to the reinsurance pooling agreement 
this amount reduced the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned by 
percentage points 
other underwriting expenses also include  related to the november resignation of the company s president and  of consulting and due diligence expenses pertaining to the investigation of business opportunities 
other underwriting expenses also included  and  in and  respectively  related to the purchase of territorial credits against nyaip assignments discussed earlier in this item

this change eliminated state income taxes for all non life insurance companies and increased the premium tax rate from to 
this change in new york state law lowered the company s effective income tax rate by approximately percentage points in further  as a result of this change  the company reduced its deferred tax liability with respect to new york state income taxes to during this one time benefit reduced the company s effective income tax rate for by percentage points 
in addition  tax exempt income reduced the company s effective income tax rate by and percentage points  respectively  for the years ended december  and in addition  the company recorded adjustments to prior years taxes and reversed excess tax reserves related to uncertain tax positions which reduced the company s effective income tax rate by and percentage points  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to total revenues for were  a decrease of  or from  in results of operations for reflect the effects of the services agreement and the reinsurance pooling agreement among the company  its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  mnh  and mutual  effective january  mnh did not participate in a pooling agreement in and therefore the results of operations for reflect business written independently by mnh 
this analysis provides a comparison of the company s share of pooled premiums for to unpooled premiums for the same period in  as well as a comparison of the pooled  or combined mutual and mnh  premiums written for to the combined business of mutual and mnh for the same period in  even though the companies were not party to a reinsurance pooling agreement in total combined mutual and mnh or group wide direct premiums written for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or from  in the company s pro forma share of combined direct premiums written in  in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement  was  the company recorded  of direct premiums written in the table below shows a comparison of direct premiums written by major category in and mnh pooled mnh group wide dwp share dwp year ended year ended december  december  variance variance s omitted s omitted voluntary personal lines     voluntary commercial lines     involuntary     total direct written premiums     the decrease in group wide voluntary personal lines direct premiums written resulted from a decrease in ppa direct premiums written  somewhat offset by a increase in homeowners direct premiums written 
the decrease in ppa direct premiums written is the result of the group s policy  implemented in  not to write new policies in certain jurisdictions and from the approval of the companies plan to withdraw from the new jersey ppa market by the new jersey department of banking and insurance  which was effective in june as a result  voluntary ppa policies in force at december  were  a decrease of  or from  at december  the increase in group wide voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written resulted from a increase in average premium per commercial lines policy  somewhat offset by a decrease in commercial lines policies in force 
a average increase in commercial lines premium rates contributed to the increase in average premium per commercial lines policy 
the decrease in group wide involuntary written premiums  which consist primarily of involuntary ppa insurance  resulted primarily from a decrease in group wide assignments from the nyaip to  in from  in the nyaip provides coverage for individuals who are unable to obtain auto insurance in the voluntary market 
assignments from the nyaip vary depending upon a company s ppa market share and the size of the nyaip 
the company is unable to predict the volume of future assignments from the nyaip 
in order to minimize the adverse impact of assignments from the nyaip  the company purchased territorial credits from an unaffiliated insurance company 
the credits against nyaip assignments were generated by the other insurance company for writing ppa business in certain localities in new york with ppa market availability problems 
the other insurance company  by nature of its concentration in ppa business in credit territories  generated more credits than it required to offset its nyaip assignments 
the credits purchased reduced the company s share of the nyaip by  in group wide pooled net premiums written for were  a decrease of  or from  for this decrease resulted from the increase in group wide direct premiums written  offset by an increase in as compared to  of reinsurance premiums ceded to third parties 
the company s share of pooled net premiums written in in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement was  a decrease of  or from its unpooled net premiums written of  in the company s share of pooled net premiums earned in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement for was  net premiums earned in were  the decrease in net premiums earned primarily resulted from the decreases in net premiums written in and had mnh s share of pooled premiums earned in been mnh s share for  earned premiums for would have been  net investment income was  in  a decrease of  or from  in the average pre tax yield associated with the investment portfolio decreased basis points to in compared to average invested assets for decreased from the year earlier period 
net investment gains were  
per fully diluted share after taxes in compared to  
per fully diluted share after taxes in a majority of the amount  resulted from the company taking advantage of a share repurchase program for an otherwise illiquid security 
other revenues were  in  a decrease of  or from  in  primarily due to a  or decrease in service fee income 
net losses and lae were  for  a decrease of  or from  for this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in net premiums earned 
the loss and lae ratio was for compared to for the company recorded decreases to its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years of  and  in and  respectively 
these decreases in losses and lae relating to prior accident years reduced the loss and lae ratio in and by 
and percentage points  respectively 
the decrease recorded in was primarily the result of favorable loss development related to known claims on workers compensation policies 
the following table documents the changes in the estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years recorded in for the company s major lines of business commercial workers accident home ppa auto compen commercial general all year owners liability liability sation package liability other total increases decreases in thousands prior to total     the company s reduction in its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years represented less than of the recorded reserve for losses and lae at december  during  both paid and incurred losses and lae emerged at amounts that were greater than anticipated when reserves for loss and lae were estimated and recorded at december  for the workers compensation and general liability lines of business 
this unfavorable emergence was offset by lower than anticipated loss and lae emergence in the company s ppa liability particularly for accidents occurring in and commercial auto liability lines of business 
the company made no changes to the key assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of its reserves for losses and lae during a reasonable possibility exists in any year that relatively minor fluctuations in the estimate of reserves for losses and lae may have a significant impact on the company s net income 
this is due primarily to the size of the company s reserves for losses and lae  at december  relative to its net income 
involuntary automobile insurance business increased the company s calendar year loss and lae ratio by approximately and percentage points for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the combined ratio on involuntary automobile business was greater than the combined ratio on voluntary automobile business 
the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned was in both and an increase in the premium tax rate in new york state  which is discussed in the following paragraph  added 
percentage points to the company s ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned in the period 
other underwriting expenses for included  of retrospective commission income to be received from mutual in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement 
this retrospective commission income reduced the ratio of deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned by 
percentage points 
other underwriting expenses also included  related to the purchase of territorial credits against nyaip assignments discussed earlier in this item  which added 
percentage points to the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned 
there were no such credits purchased in commissions  premium taxes and other state assessments that vary directly with the company s premium volume represented of net premiums earned in and in the provision for income taxes for includes the effect of a may change in new york state law with respect to the taxation of non life insurance companies 
this change eliminated state income taxes for all non life insurance companies and increased the premium tax rate from to 
this change in new york state law lowered the company s effective income tax rate by approximately percentage points in further  as a result of this change  the company reduced its deferred tax liability with respect to new york state income taxes to during this one time benefit reduced the company s effective income tax rate for by percentage points 
in addition  tax exempt income reduced the company s effective income tax rate by and percentage points  respectively  for the years ended december  and critical accounting policies reserve for losses and lae loss and lae reserves are established for known claims based on the type and circumstance of the loss and the results of similar losses 
for claims not yet reported to the company  loss reserves are based on statistical information from previous experience periods adjusted for inflation  trends in court decisions and economic conditions 
lae reserves are intended to cover the ultimate cost of investigating all losses that have occurred and defending lawsuits  if any  arising from these losses 
lae reserves are evaluated periodically using statistical techniques which compare current costs with historical data 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
the company s reserving process is based on the assumption that past experiences  adjusted for the effect of current developments and trends  are relevant in predicting future events 
in the absence of specific developments  the process also assumes that the legal climate regarding the claims process and underlying liabilities remains constant 
other assumptions employed by the company or its actuarial firm change from time to time as circumstances change 
in estimating loss and lae reserves the company employs a number of actuarial methods  depending on their applicability to each line of business  in order to balance the advantages and disadvantages of each method 
therefore  a range of estimates is developed for each line of business 
however  the company does not believe it is appropriate to sum the high and low values developed using different actuarial methods for each line of business to determine a range for the company s total loss and lae reserves 
therefore the company s actuary and its consulting actuary only provide the company with their respective best estimates of total loss and lae reserves by summing their best estimate for each line of business 
due to the company s small size  the presence or absence of a limited number of moderate losses  as well as the timing of the reporting of such losses to the company by claimants could result in changes in actuarial estimates that are significant to the company s net income for a quarter or a year 
as such  management recognizes that the best estimate may not be more accurate than other amounts within a few percentage points of total loss and lae reserves 
the company has recorded changes in reserves for prior accident year losses in most years 
in and  the company decreased its reserves for prior years by  and  respectively 
the total reserves for losses and lae were  and  at december  and  respectively 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  such as commissions net of reinsurance commissions  premiums taxes and certain other underwriting expenses which vary directly with premium volume  are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are evaluated on an aggregate basis at least annually  to determine if recorded amounts exceed estimated recoverable amounts after allowing for anticipated investment income 
premium deficiencies if any  are recorded as amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
actual amounts may vary from the company s estimates 
investments fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
net unrealized holding gains or losses  net of taxes  are shown as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold and in instances when a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be other than temporary 
the company s investment committee  comprised of the chief operating officer  the chief investment officer and the chief financial officer  meets monthly and monitors the company s investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
the investment committee considers the nature of the investment  the severity and length of the decline in fair value  events specific to the issuer including valuation modeling  overall market conditions  and the company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
when a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be other than temporary  the company adjusts the cost basis of that security to fair value 
a charge to earnings is recorded as a loss 
future increases in fair value and future decreases in fair value if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources in developing its investment strategy the company determines a level of cash and short term investments which  when combined with expected cash flow  is estimated to be adequate to meet expected cash obligations 
due to declining written premiums however  the company s operating activities have resulted in a use of cash each year since the company s decreasing participation percentage in the pooled business over the remaining years of the reinsurance pooling agreement will likely result in continued negative cash flows from operations 
net cash used in operations was  in the company believes that careful management of the relationship between assets and liabilities will minimize the likelihood that investment portfolio sales will be necessary to fund insurance operations  and that the effect of any such sales  if any  on the company s stockholders equity will not be material 
the company s objectives with respect to its investment portfolio include maximizing total return within investment guidelines while protecting policyholders surplus and maintaining flexibility 
the company relies on premiums as a major source of cash  and therefore liquidity 
cash flows from the company s investment portfolio  in the form of interest or principal payments  are an additional source of liquidity 
at december   the company owned investment securities of which had unrealized losses 
as of december  all of the company s fixed maturity investments were exchange traded or are readily marketable and are supported by the broker dealer community 
the total potential impact on the company s future earnings if the unrealized losses associated with its investment portfolio at december  were to become other than temporary would be  or  after taxes 
included in net investment losses for the year ended december  are write downs on two investment securities held in the company s investment portfolio at december  determined to have had an other than temporary impairment in market value 
the total amount of other than temporary impairments recorded as losses amounted to  in no other than temporary impairments were recorded in or at december    or of the company s investment portfolio was invested in non investment grade securities compared to  or at december  the company designates newly acquired fixed maturity investments as available for sale and carries these investments at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to these investments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
at december   the company recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss in its consolidated balance sheet  of net unrealized losses  net of taxes  associated with its investments classified as available for sale 
at december  the company s portfolio of fixed maturity investments represented of invested assets 
management believes that this level of fixed maturity investments is consistent with the company s liquidity needs because it anticipates that cash receipts from net premiums written  investment income and maturing securities will enable the company to satisfy its cash obligations 
furthermore  a portion of the company s fixed maturity investments are invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities which  in addition to interest income  provide monthly paydowns of bond principal 
at december    or  of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities 
the company invests in a variety of collateralized mortgage obligation cmo products but has not invested in the derivative type of cmo products such as interest only  principal only or inverse floating rate securities 
all of the company s cmo investments have a secondary market and their effect on the company s liquidity does not differ significantly from that of other fixed maturity investments 
at december   the company owed  of retrospective commissions to mutual calculated in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement see the compared to section of this item for a discussion of retrospective commissions 
the reinsurance pooling agreement requires the amount of retrospective commissions to be calculated and paid annually  six months after the end of each calendar year 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during at december  the company was holding  shares in treasury 
the company has arranged for a  unsecured credit facility from a bank 
any borrowings under this facility are payable on demand and carry an interest rate which can be fixed or variable and is negotiated at the time of each advance 
this facility is available for general working capital purposes and for repurchases of the company s common stock 
no amounts were outstanding related to this facility at december  as a holding company  the company is dependent upon cash dividends from mnh to meet its obligations and to pay any cash dividends 
mnh is subject to new hampshire insurance laws which place certain restrictions on its ability to pay dividends without the prior approval of state regulatory authorities 
these restrictions limit dividends to those that  when added to all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  would not exceed of the insurer s policyholders surplus as of the preceding december st 
the maximum amount of dividends that mnh could pay during any twelve month period ending in without the prior approval of the new hampshire insurance commissioner is  mnh paid  and  of dividends to the company in august and february  respectively 
the company paid quarterly cash dividends to its common stockholders of 
per share in  which amounted to  regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to its statutory surplus should not exceed to the company has consistently followed a business strategy that would allow mnh to meet this to regulatory guideline 
mnh s ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus for was 
to off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations at december   the company had no contractual obligations related to long term debt  capital leases  operating leases  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities reflected on its balance sheet 
a summary of the company s non cancelable contractual obligations follows less than more than total year years years years reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses      unlike most other contractual obligations  reserves for losses and lae do not have specified due dates 
the amounts shown in the preceding table are the company s estimates of these amounts 
recently issued accounting standards the following accounting pronouncements were issued by the financial accounting standards board during and are effective for fiscal years ending subsequent to december  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
inventory costs 
sfas no 
accounting for real estate time sharing transactions 
sfas no 
exchanges of non monetary assets 
safs no 
revised share based payment 
the company does not expect any of these pronouncements to have any impact on the company s financial statements 
federal legislation the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  signed into law on november   provides a federal backstop for losses related to the writing of the terrorism peril in property and casualty insurance policies 
the company has complied with tria requirements to notify commercial policyholders about requirements of the law  that the company was required to offer terrorism coverage and how the coverage would be priced 
unless renewed by congress  tria will expire on december  currently  the company is issuing terrorism exclusions on its commercial lines policies in states other than new york  where terrorism exlusions have not been approved by the new york insurance department 
these exclusions will be effective if congress does not extend tria 
environmental claims mnh  like many other property and casualty insurance companies  is subject to environmental damage claims asserted by or against its insureds 
management of the company is of the opinion that based on various court decisions throughout the country  certain of these claims should not be recoverable under the terms of mnh s insurance policies because of either specific or general coverage exclusions contained in the policies 
however  there is no assurance that the courts will agree with mnh s position in every case  nor can there be assurance that material claims will not be asserted under policies which a court will find do not explicitly or implicitly exclude claims for environmental damages 
management  however  is not aware of any pending claim or group of claims which would result in a liability that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company or mnh 
inflation inflation affects the company  like other companies in the property and casualty insurance industry  by contributing to higher losses  lae and operating costs  as well as greater investment income resulting from the higher interest rates which can prevail in an inflationary period 
premium rates  however  may not keep pace with inflation since competitive forces may limit the company s ability to increase premium rates 
the company considers inflationary trends in estimating its reserves for claims reported and for incurred but not reported claims 
relationship with mutual the company s and mnh s business and day to day operations are closely aligned with those of mutual 
this is the result of a combination of factors 
mutual has had a historical ownership interest in the company and mnh 
prior to november mnh was a wholly owned subsidiary of mutual 
following the company s initial public offering in november and until a secondary stock offering in july the company was a majority owned subsidiary of mutual 
at december  mutual owned of the company s common stock 
under the services agreement  mutual provides the company and mnh with all facilities and with personnel to operate their business 
the officers of the company or mnh are employees of mutual whose services are provided to  and paid for by  the company and mnh through the services agreement 
also  the operation of mnh s insurance business  which offers substantially the same lines of insurance as mutual through the same independent insurance agents  creates a very close relationship among the companies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risk related to the company s financial instruments primarily relates to its investment portfolio 
the value of the company s investment portfolio of  at december  is subject to changes in interest rates and to a lesser extent on credit quality 
further  certain mortgage backed and asset backed securities are exposed to accelerated prepayment risk generally caused by interest rate movements 
if interest rates decline  mortgage holders would be more likely to refinance existing mortgages at lower rates 
acceleration of future repayments could adversely affect future investment income  if the accelerated receipts were invested in lower yielding securities 
the table below provides information related to the company s fixed maturity investments at december  the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the cash flows are based upon the maturity date or  in the case of mortgage backed and asset backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from those shown in the table

actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  the forward looking statements should not be considered projections of future events by the company
