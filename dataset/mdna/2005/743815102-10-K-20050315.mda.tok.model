overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit social services organizations whose operations we manage 
as a result of  and in response to  the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have increased our capacity to provide services in previously underserved geographic areas through the development of new programs and by consummating strategic acquisitions 
as of december   we provided services directly and through the entities we manage to over  clients from locations in states and the district of columbia 
our goal is to be the provider of choice to the social services industry 
focusing on our core competencies in the delivery of home and community based counseling  foster care and provider managed services  we believe we are well positioned to offer the highest quality of service to our clients and provide a viable alternative to state and local governments current service delivery systems 
our industry is highly fragmented  competitive and dependent on government funding 
we depend on our experience  financial strength and broad presence to compete vigorously in each service offering 
challenges for us include competing with local incumbent social services providers in some of the areas we seek to enter and in rural areas where significant growth opportunities exist  finding and retaining qualified employees 
we seek strategic acquisitions as one way to enter competitive markets 
our business is highly dependent on our obtaining contracts with government sponsored entities 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses such as leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel before we receive any contract payments  and  under some of the large contracts we are awarded  we are required to invest significant sums of money before receiving any contract payments 
we are also required to recruit and hire qualified staff to perform the services under contract 
we strive to control these start up costs by leveraging our existing infrastructure to maximize our resources and manage our growth effectively 
however  with each contract we are awarded  we face the challenge of quickly and effectively building a client base to generate revenue to recover these costs 
on august   we completed our initial public offering of common stock in connection with which we sold million shares at an offering price of per share 
additionally  on september   our underwriters exercised their over allotment option pursuant to which we sold another  shares at an offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering costs 
on april   we completed a follow on offering of common stock in connection with which we sold  shares at an offering price of including an over allotment of  shares exercised by our underwriters on that day 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering costs 
prior to our initial public offering in  we were largely funded by venture capital and mezzanine debt 
we used proceeds from our initial public offering to pay off our then existing long term debt 
our working capital requirements are now primarily funded by cash from operations 
in addition  we have a million revolving line of credit and a million acquisition term loan with healthcare business credit corporation or hbcc 
proceeds from our initial public offering and follow on offering as well as our credit facilities with hbcc provide funding for general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions 
how we earn our revenue our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our financial statements as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our financial statements as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of our managed entities 
we refer to the revenues of these entities as managed entity revenue 
in addition  from time to time  we provide short term consulting services to other social services organizations for which we receive consulting fees that are a fixed amount per contract 
any such consulting revenues are presented in our statement of operations as management fees 
how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business grows internally  through organic expansion into new markets and increases in the number of clients served pursuant to contracts we or our managed entities are awarded  and externally through acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
in january  camelot community care  inc  one of the not for profit entities we manage  was awarded a contract by the florida department of children and families pursuant to florida s community based care initiative  to provide home and community based social services in the fort myers area 
the term of the contract is february  through june   and provides for contract payments of up to million per year  or million over the term 
our management fee in relation to this contract is of camelot community care  inc revenue from the contract after deducting pass through costs 
when we expand organically  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs  including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred  and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we also pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
since  we completed four significant acquisitions including parents and children together  inc  family preservation services  inc  camelot care corporation  referred to as camelot  and cypress management services  inc  referred to as cypress  through which we have established a presence in arizona  florida  illinois  nebraska  ohio  tennessee and virginia 
more recently  during the year ended december   through our acquisitions described below  we enhanced our presence in indiana  maine  michigan and new mexico and entered new markets in california  massachusetts  nevada and pennsylvania 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions is generally accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage in expanding through acquisitions 
we also have to integrate the acquired business into our operations  which could disrupt our business  and we may not be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration 
in all our markets  we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees  as that is our most important variable cost and the key to our management of our margins 
acquisitions since december   we have completed the following acquisitions on january   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of dockside services  inc  or dockside  an indiana based provider of youth services  for cash in the amount of million and two subordinated promissory notes each in the principal amount of  for aggregate consideration of million 
this acquisition expands our home and community based counseling operations in the states of indiana and michigan 
effective january   we acquired the remaining membership interest in rio grande management company  llc  or rio grande management  for cash in the amount of  which was prepaid in december rio grande management was originally formed in september  with us owning of its membership interest and the ten agencies whose members comprise the board of directors of rio grande behavioral health services  inc  a not for profit social services provider  collectively owning the remaining membership interest 
rio grande behavioral health services provides community based social and mental health network services in new mexico  and rio grande management manages those operations in return for a fixed management fee per month 
by acquiring the interests of our co venturers  we now own of the membership interest of rio grande management which maintains a management agreement with rio grande behavioral health services 
on may   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of pottsville behavioral counseling group  inc  or pottsville  a pennsylvania based provider of screening and assessment services to medicaid eligible children and youth  for a purchase price of cash in the amount of million 
in conjunction with this acquisition  we entered into a management agreement with the redco group or redco  a pennsylvania not for profit social services organization pursuant to which we provide certain management services to redco in exchange for a predetermined management fee 
the pottsville acquisition and the new management agreement with redco provide us with a long term entry into the pennsylvania social services market 
effective june   we acquired all of the rights under existing management agreements with care development of maine  or cdom  and fcp  inc  or fcp  from care development  inc  a maine not for profit corporation  for cash in the amount of million 
we anticipate paying an additional million subject to a definitive agreement 
cdom and fcp are not for profit organizations providing foster care and community based services in the state of maine and commonwealth of massachusetts 
the acquisition of the management agreements with these organizations expands our foster care and community based services in maine and opens a new market in massachusetts 
on july   we acquired all of the equity interests in choices group  inc  aspen mso  llc and college community services  a california mutual benefit corporation  which we collectively refer to as the aspen companies  for cash of million million of which was placed into escrow as security for any indemnification obligations and any working capital adjustments 
according to the provisions of the purchase agreement  we will receive million in working capital 
the acquisition was retroactively effective as of july  in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement 
the acquisition of the aspen companies establishes operations in california and nevada and adds drug court treatment to our array of social services 
we continue to selectively identify and pursue attractive acquisition opportunities and have developed a pipeline of potential acquisition candidates 
there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  and our management contract relationships 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time services are rendered at the amounts stated in our contracts and when the collection of these amounts is considered to be probable 
at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 
as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the various billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contract 
fee for service contracts 
revenues related to services provided under fee for service contracts are recognized as revenue at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and cost based service contracts 
as a result of the acquisition of the aspen companies  we acquired cost based service contracts where revenue is recorded at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies such as budgeted costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or insufficient encounters 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after june  which is the contracting payers year end  we submit a cost report which is used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs to provide these services 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our cost reports are routinely audited on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in the year of settlement 
the aspen companies cost based service contracts represented approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  case rate contract 
prior to july   we provided services under one contract under which we received a predetermined amount per month for a specified number of eligible beneficiaries 
under this contract  referred to as a case rate contract  we received the established amount regardless of the level of services provided to the beneficiaries during the month and thus recognized this contractual rate as revenue on a monthly basis 
to the extent we provided services that exceeded the contracted revenue amounts  we requested the payer to reimburse us for these additional costs 
historically  the payer had reimbursed us for all such excess costs although it had no ongoing contractual obligation to do so under the case rate contract 
consequently  we did not recognize the excess cost amounts as additional revenue until the payer actually reimbursed us for such amounts or entered into an agreement contractually committing the payer to pay us and collection of such amount was determined to be probable 
effective july   the case rate contract was amended to be an annual block purchase contract 
in exchange for one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month  the agreement specifies that we are to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete continuum of services including but not limited to intake  assessment  eligibility  case management and therapeutic services 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a limit to the level of services that must be provided to these beneficiaries 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 
we are required to regularly submit service encounters to the payer electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of the payer s june fiscal year  the payer is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if at any time the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  the payer has the right to suspend payments to us or recoup funds paid to us 
we recognize revenue from this contract equal to the lesser of encounter value  which represents the actual level of services rendered  or the contract amount 
for the six months ended december   revenues under the annual block purchase contract totaled million 
the payer has not suspended payments to us nor have we returned any amounts to the payer 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to return any amounts to the payer and that our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts paid to us under the amended contract 
the terms of the contract will be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our service offerings under the contract 
our revenues under the previous case rate contract  and since july  the annual block contract  represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and we recognize management fee revenues from our management agreements as such amounts are earned  as defined by the respective management agreement  and collection of such amount is considered probable 
we assess the likelihood of whether any of our management fee revenues may need to be returned to help our managed entities fund their working capital needs 
if the likelihood is other than remote  we defer the recognition of all or a portion of the management fees received 
to the extent we defer management fees as a means of funding any of our managed entities losses from operations  such amounts are not recognized as management fee revenues until they are ultimately collected from the operating income of the not for profit entities 
consulting agreements 
commencing in december  we entered into consulting agreements with other entities that provide government sponsored social services 
under the agreements  we evaluate and make recommendations with respect to their management  administrative and operational services 
we may continue to enter into consulting agreements on a small scale in the future 
in exchange for these consulting services  we receive a fixed fee that is either payable upon completion of the services or on a monthly basis 
these consulting agreements are generally short term in nature and are subject to termination by either party at any time  for any reason  upon advance written notice 
revenues related to these services are recognized at the time such consulting services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
fees earned pursuant to our consulting agreements represented less than of our revenue for the years ended december  and the costs associated with generating our management fee revenues are accounted for in client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  as amended by sab  which requires that four basic criteria be met before recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe our revenue recognition principles are consistent with the guidance set forth in sab  as amended by sab allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable on a monthly basis 
we determine the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific identification of individual accounts and review of aging trends 
any account receivable older than days is automatically deemed uncollectible 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
if the financial condition of our payers were to deteriorate  further additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
as a result of our acquisition of the aspen companies  we acquired cost based service contracts where revenues and accounts receivable are recorded at established billing rates or at the amounts realizable under these contracts 
amounts are based on provisional rates and allocations of contract costs that may be adjusted retroactively based on annual costs reports filed by us with the contracting payers 
the cost reports are audited annually 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers if necessary 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
our write off experience for the years ended december  and was less than of revenue 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets we analyze the carrying value of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year and between annual valuations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when determining whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
we use valuation techniques consistent with a market approach by deriving a multiple of our ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization based on the market value of our common stock at year end and then applying this multiple to each reporting unit s ebitda for the year to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss is measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed as of december  and resulted in no impairment losses 
when we consummate an acquisition we separately value all acquired identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in connection with our recent acquisitions described above  we allocated a portion of the purchase consideration to certain management contracts and customer relationships based on the expected direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows over the useful life of the assets 
we assess whether certain relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes 
we determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the nature of the underlying contracts with state and local agencies and the likelihood that the underlying contracts will renew over future periods 
the likelihood of renewal is based on our contract renewal experience and the contract renewal experiences of the entities acquired 
under certain conditions we may assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on expected future cash flows 
if the review indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit social services organizations where we provide them with business development  administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly or indirectly with state and local agencies to supply a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and organized with its own independent board of directors 
our management agreements with these not for profit organizations generally require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies such as employee enrichment programs  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
the accounting for our relationships with these organizations is based on a number of judgments regarding certain facts related to the control of these organizations and the terms of our management agreements 
any significant changes in the facts upon which these judgments are based could have a significant impact on our accounting for these relationships 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of emerging issues task force  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with consolidated management agreements  or the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised  or interpretation no 
r  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of interpretation no 
r  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated total revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented six months ended december  twelve months ended december  year ended december  revenues home and community based services foster care services management fees total revenues operating expenses client service expense general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss non operating income expense interest expense  net put warrant accretion write off of deferred financing costs equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december  percent change home and community based services foster care services management fees total revenue home and community based services 
the acquisition of dockside in january contributed million to our home and community based services revenue for we added clients as a result of this acquisition and also positioned ourselves for cross selling of foster care services and expansion into other markets in the states of indiana and michigan 
our new home and community based services contracts in fort pierce and west palm beach  florida collectively yielded million in home and community based services revenue for the acquisition of pottsville in may provided million in home and community based services revenue for we added clients as a result of this acquisition and entered into the pennsylvania market 
the acquisition of the aspen companies in july contributed million in home and community based services for we added approximately  clients as a result of this acquisition and entered into the california and nevada markets 
excluding the acquisition of dockside  pottsville  the fort pierce and west palm beach contracts and the aspen companies  our home and community based services provided additional revenue of approximately million for  as compared to due to client volume increases in new and existing locations 
we experienced a net increase of approximately  new home and community based clients during as compared to  with increases at our existing locations and as a result of the new locations that we opened in north carolina and tennessee 
foster care services 
foster care services revenue contributed an additional million to total revenue for as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to client volume growth in our current markets  commencement of operations in delaware  which yielded  in  and cross selling efforts in our traditional home and community based markets such as arizona  florida and virginia where we added approximately million 
we expect cross selling activities will continue and provide additional revenues in the future as we focus on continuous expansion of our foster care services 
management fees 
revenue for entities we manage but do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes managed entity revenue increased to million for as compared to million for management fee revenue as a percentage of managed entity revenue decreased to for compared to for primarily due to the effect of a predetermined monthly fee we charged redco  a managed entity  and comparatively lower management fee percentages related to the management agreements with cdom and fcp that we acquired in june the combined effects of business growth  the acquisition of the remaining interest in rio grande management  and the acquisition of the management agreements with cdom  fcp and redco yielded approximately million in additional management fee revenue for  as compared to furthermore  in february  we began to manage the provision of services in the fort myers  florida market by camelot community care  inc pursuant to a contract awarded to it by the state of florida 
this contract accounted for an increase in management fee revenue of million for  as compared to in addition  under five short term consulting contracts that we entered into during  we generated  in consulting fees 
on june   rio grande behavioral health services  inc  or rio grande  received a notice canceling one of its provider hmo network contracts effective july  subsequently  rio grande commenced negotiations for a new contract 
rio grande and the payer have agreed to continue their relationship under new terms 
in connection with this agreement  we amended the management agreement between us and rio grande to change the management fee charged to rio grande for management services from a per member per month based fee to a fixed fee per month 
the fixed fee was comparable to the previous per member per month based fee and remained at this predetermined level until january   at which time the fixed fee was reduced 
the new fixed fee will decrease our management fee revenue from this management services agreement by approximately  for the first half of when compared to the six months ending december  currently  the state of new mexico is modifying its behavioral health services delivery system 
we expect that the state will finalize the modification of its behavioral health services delivery system by july   at which time new contracts for behavioral health services will be administered by one administrative services entity 
we believe this change in the state of new mexico s behavioral health services delivery system will be favorable to rio grande 
we believe that the reduction in our management fee for the first half of will not significantly affect our total management fee revenue for the year as we expect to renegotiate the management fee with rio grande when the state of new mexico has completed the modification of its behavioral health services delivery system 
while we anticipate a favorable outcome will result from the modification of the state of new mexico s behavioral health services delivery system  there are no assurances that such outcome will materialize or that our negotiations with rio grande regarding our management fee will be as expected 
operating expenses client service expense 
client service expense includes the following for and year ended december  percent change payroll and related costs purchased services other operating expenses stock based compensation total client service expense payroll and related costs 
to support our growth  provide high quality service and meet increasing compliance requirements expected by the government agencies with which we contract to provide services  we must hire and retain employees that possess higher degrees of education  experience and licensures 
as we enter new markets  we expect payroll and related costs to continue to increase 
as a result of our organic growth  our payroll and related costs increased for  as compared to  as we added new direct care providers  administrative staff and other employees 
in addition  we added new employees in connection with the acquisition of dockside  pottsville and the aspen companies which resulted in an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately million for we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract in order to optimize the quality of service we provide while managing the payroll and related costs to provide these services 
determining our staffing needs may not directly coincide with the generation of revenue as we are required at times to increase our capacity to provide services prior to starting new contracts 
alternatively  we may lag behind increases in client referrals as we may have difficulty recruiting employees to staff our contracts 
furthermore  acquisitions may cause fluctuations in our payroll and related costs as a percentage of revenue from period to period as we attempt to merge new operations into our service delivery system 
as a percentage of revenue  payroll and related expense increased from for to for primarily due to our efforts to increase the number of employees to service our growth 
purchased services 
increases in foster parent payments resulting from an increase in the number of foster care clients and an increase in the number of referrals requiring pharmacy and support services partially offset by a decrease in the number of referrals requiring out of home placement accounted for the increase in purchased services for we strive to manage our purchased services costs by constantly seeking alternative treatments to costly services that we do not provide 
although we manage and provide alternative treatments to clients requiring out of home placements and other purchased services  we sometimes cannot control the number of referrals requiring out of home placement and support services under our annual block contract 
despite the increase in purchased services for  as a percentage of revenue  purchased services decreased from for to for increases in revenue from both organic growth and acquisitions outpaced the growth in purchased services for other operating expenses 
as a result of our organic growth during  we added new locations in north carolina and tennessee that contributed to an increase in other operating expenses for when compared to the acquisition of dockside  pottsville and the aspen companies added approximately million to other operating expenses for as a percentage of revenue other operating expenses decreased from for to for primarily due to our revenue growth rate 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation of approximately  and  for and  represents stock and stock options granted to employees at prices and exercise prices less than the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant of such stock and stock options 
general and administrative expense 
year ended december  percent change the addition of corporate staff to adequately support our growth and provide services under our management agreements  higher rates of pay for employees as well as increased accounting and legal fees  information systems improvements  directors and officers insurance  general and professional liability insurance and professional services fees accounted for an increase of million of corporate administrative expenses for also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expense were investor relations costs such as costs associated with meetings and presentations to investors as well as professional fees related to increased services provided for securities and exchange commission filings  report reviews and regulatory compliance 
furthermore  as a result of our growth during  rent and facilities management increased million in part due to our acquisition activities 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense increased to for from for primarily as a result of the addition of corporate staff and additional professional services fees related to services provided for securities and exchange commission filings 
depreciation and amortization 
year ended december  percent change the increase in depreciation and amortization from period to period primarily resulted from the amortization of customer relationships of  related to the acquisition of dockside  pottsville and the aspen companies 
also contributing to the increase in depreciation and amortization was the amortization of the fair value of the acquired management agreements with rio grande  cdom  fcp and redco and increased depreciation expense due to the addition of software and computer equipment during as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization decreased from for to for primarily due to a higher revenue growth rate 
non operating income expense interest expense  net 
due to a lower level of debt for  pursuant to the repayment of all of the amounts that were borrowed under our loan and security agreements with healthcare business credit corporation and from our mezzanine lenders  interest expense decreased in as compared to as a percentage of revenue  interest expense from period to period decreased from for to for provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on our estimated annual effective income tax rate for the full fiscal year equal to approximately 
our estimated effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible permanent differences and state income taxes 
at december   we have future tax benefits of million related to million of available federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire in years through and million of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in through approximately million of the federal net operating loss carryforwards result from the camelot acquisition 
the future use of these net operating loss carryforwards is limited on an annual basis 
our valuation allowance includes  of state net operating loss carryforwards and  of federal net operating loss carryforwards for which we have concluded that is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in the ordinary course of operations 
fiscal year ended december  compared to unaudited twelve month period ended december  revenues the following table sets forth our revenues by service offering for the years ended december  and year ended december  percent change home and community based services foster care services management fee total revenue home and community based services 
contributing to the overall increase in total revenue year over year  our home and community based services provided additional revenue of approximately million in fiscal which represented of the increase as compared to the twelve months ended december  we experienced a net increase of  new home and community based clients in fiscal  with increases at our existing locations and as a result of the new locations that we opened in fiscal in delaware  florida  oklahoma  maine  texas and the district of columbia 
this increase in the number of clients accounted for million of the increase in our home and community based services revenue in fiscal in addition  during  we generated higher rates for previously under provided services in certain markets as we successfully positioned ourselves as the provider of choice 
these rate increases accounted for million of the increased home and community based services revenue in fiscal further  we successfully negotiated and received an annual contract rate increase of related to our case rate contract in arizona 
this rate increase was effective july  and accounted for an additional million of our increased home and community based services revenue in fiscal in january  we consummated the acquisition of dockside services  inc  from which we added clients as a result of this acquisition and also positioned ourselves for cross selling of foster care services and expansion into other markets in the states of indiana and michigan 
in addition to other contract awards  we have been awarded contracts to perform home and community based services in gainsville  fort pierce and west palm beach  florida  which we expect will collectively add approximately million of annual revenue once the contracts are fully operational 
foster care services 
foster care services revenue contributed an additional million to total revenue in fiscal compared to the twelve months ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to the inclusion of twelve full months of revenue pursuant to camelot foster care contracts in fiscal compared to ten months of revenue in the previous twelve months  as the camelot acquisition was consummated in march substantially all of the remaining million of increased foster care revenue resulted from our commencement of operations in delaware  organic growth in camelot s historical markets and cross selling efforts in our traditional home and community based markets 
during this twelve month period  we increased the number of foster care clients from at december  to at december  we expect cross selling activities will continue and provide additional revenues in the future as we focus on expanding our foster care services to existing strategic geographic areas 
management fees 
revenue for entities we manage but do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes managed entity revenue increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior twelve months 
management fee revenue as a percentage of managed entity revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior twelve months 
in connection with the acquisition of cypress in january and camelot in march  we acquired the rights to management agreements with intervention services  inc and camelot community care  inc 
both organizations are not for profit social services organizations 
under these agreements  we are entitled to compensation for management services rendered equal to a percentage of the respective entity s total revenue 
these entities generated an additional million in managed entity revenue in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  and accounted for an increase in our management fee revenue of million in the same period 
effective july   our management agreements with our managed entities were amended to reflect a higher fee percentage 
the combined effects of business growth and a higher management fee percentage yielded approximately  in additional management fee revenue in fiscal furthermore  we received aggregate management fee bonuses of  from intervention services  inc  camelot community care  inc and family preservation services of south carolina  inc in fiscal effective july   when these management agreements were amended in connection with the renegotiation of our fee arrangement with these entities  the bonus provision was removed 
operating expenses client service expense 
client service expense includes the following for the years ended december  and year ended december  percent change payroll and related costs purchased services other operating expenses stock based compensation total client service expense payroll and related costs 
to support our growth  provide high quality service and meet increasing compliance requirements expected by the government agencies with which we contract to provide services  we must hire and retain employees that possess higher degrees of education  experience and licensures 
as we enter new markets  we expect payroll and related costs to continue to increase at a high rate 
as a result of our growth  our payroll and related costs increased in fiscal as we added new direct care providers  administrative staff and contracted employees 
we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract in order to maximize the quality of service we provide while controlling the payroll and related costs to provide these services 
determining our staffing needs may not coincide with the generation of revenue as we are required at times to increase our capacity to provide services prior to acquiring new contracts 
alternatively  we may lag behind increases in client referrals and revenue as we may have difficulty recruiting employees to staff our contracts 
in addition  acquisitions will cause fluctuations in our payroll and related costs as a percentage of revenue from period to period as we attempt to merge new operations into our service delivery system 
as a percentage of revenue  payroll and related expense decreased from in the twelve months ended december  to in fiscal primarily due to an increase in our revenue growth rate from both organic growth and acquisitions 
purchased services 
increases in foster parent payments resulting from an increase in the number of foster care clients and an increase in the number of referrals under our case rate contract requiring pharmacy  out of home placement and support services accounted for the increase in purchased services in fiscal we strive to manage our purchased services costs by constantly seeking alternative treatments to costly services that we do not provide 
although we manage and provide alternative treatments to clients requiring out of home placements and other purchased services  we cannot control the number of referrals requiring out of home placement and support services we receive from period to period under our case rate contract 
despite the increase in purchased services in fiscal  as a percentage of revenue  purchased services decreased from in the twelve months ended december  to in fiscal increases in revenue from both organic growth and acquisitions outpaced the growth in purchased services during fiscal other operating expenses 
as a result of our growth during fiscal  we added new locations in delaware  florida  oklahoma  maine  texas and the district of columbia that resulted in an increase in other operating expenses for that period when compared to the twelve months ended december  notwithstanding the increase in other operating expenses  our revenue growth rate from both organic growth and acquisitions resulted in a decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from in the twelve months ended december  to in fiscal stock based compensation 
stock based compensation of  in the twelve months ended december  and  in fiscal represents stock and stock options granted to employees at prices and exercise prices less than the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant of such stock and stock options 
during the earlier period  certain employees were granted stock at prices that were less than the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date such stock was granted  which resulted in a stock based compensation expense of  no such stock grants were made in general and administrative expense 
year ended december  percent change increased accounting and legal fees  information systems improvements  directors and officers insurance and the addition of corporate staff to adequately support our growth and provide services under our management agreements accounted for the increase of million of corporate administrative expenses in fiscal also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expense were stockholder relations costs such as costs associated with meetings and presentations to investors and with public relations efforts as well as professional fees relating to increased services provided for securities and exchange commission filings and report reviews 
furthermore  as a result of our growth in fiscal  rent and facilities management increased  partially offsetting the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal was a decrease in stock based compensation of  related to the vesting of stock options granted to certain executives and employees at exercise prices less than the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted 
in the twelve months ended december   certain employees were granted stock at prices that were less than the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date such stock was granted 
no such grants of stock were made in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense remained constant at from period to period 
depreciation and amortization 
year ended december  percent change in connection with our growth in fiscal  we added new software and computer equipment that resulted in higher depreciation expense during fiscal in addition  amortization expense increased  during the fiscal year related to the amortization of a  non compete agreement that will be amortized over two years 
we and cypress entered into this agreement in january as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense remained fairly constant from period to period  decreasing from for the twelve months ended december  to for fiscal non operating income expense interest expense  net 
due to a higher level of debt for most of fiscal  interest expense increased in fiscal as compared to the twelve months ended december  upon consummation of our initial public offering on august   we repaid all of the amounts that were due under our loan and security agreements with healthcare business credit corporation and our mezzanine lenders 
this repayment of principal and accrued interest partially offset the increase in interest expense for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  interest expense from period to period decreased from in the twelve months ended december  to in fiscal primarily due to the reduction of our debt and substantial revenue growth rate 
put warrant accretion 
put warrant accretion represents the change in the estimated fair value of our put warrant obligation 
our obligation related to this put warrant was settled in connection with our initial public offering 
write off of deferred financing costs

provision for income taxes our estimated effective income tax rate for fiscal differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the changes in our estimate for our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and state income taxes and the tax treatment for the put warrant accretion 
for the twelve months ended december   the effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to the tax treatment for the put warrant accretion and stock based compensation expense

of the total increase in revenues period to period  our home and community based services contributed additional revenue of approximately million or of the total increase for the six months ended december  as compared to the six months ended december   due to client census increases in existing and new locations 
the number of locations within virginia  florida  west virginia and maine from which we provided services grew from locations in december to locations in december as a result  we served  clients in december as compared to  clients in december the small net decrease in clients was the result of our election to terminate eight small and unprofitable or marginally profitable contracts in florida  which resulted in a net decrease in our florida clients to clients in december from clients in december this client decrease in florida was offset by the increase in the number of clients we served in virginia  west virginia and maine 
in december  we served clients in virginia as compared with clients in december in december  we served clients in west virginia as compared with clients in december  and  in december  we served clients in maine as compared with clients in december foster care services 
the acquisition of camelot in march added million in foster care services revenue in the six months ended december  compared to no revenue from such services in the comparable period in this acquisition enhanced our capability to deliver foster care services  expanded our reach into three new states  and accounted for approximately of our growth in revenue in the latter period

as a percentage of revenues  payroll and related costs decreased from for the six months ended december  to for the six months ended december  primarily due to the increase in our foster care business  which outsources a significant portion of its costs to outside providers 
purchased services 
we outsource a significant portion of our foster care services costs 
foster care services outsourced in the six months ended december  totaled approximately million 
other purchased services such as pharmacy  out of home placements  and support services accounted for an additional  increase in purchased services costs 
these costs are impacted by our ability to successfully intervene in crisis situations to prevent hospital admissions and may increase or decrease significantly as the number of referrals requiring out of home placement increase or decrease 
increases in our foster care services produced a increase in purchased services as a percentage of revenue from for the six months ended december  to for the same period in other operating expenses 
with the acquisition of camelot  which resulted in the addition of three new states and approximately new employees  we added  of additional other operating expenses

provision for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is based on our estimated annual effective income tax rate for the full fiscal year

quarterly results the following table presents quarterly historical financial information for the eight quarters ended december  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe the quarterly information contains all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to fairly present this information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year 
supplemental quarterly financial data quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenues operating income net income net income loss available to common stockholders earnings loss per share basic diluted managed entity revenue management fees quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenues operating income net income net income available to common stockholders earnings per share basic diluted managed entity revenue management fees managed entity revenue represents revenues of the not for profit social services organizations we manage 
although these revenues are not our revenues  because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and a significant portion of our management fees is based on a percentage of their revenues  we believe that the presentation of managed entity revenue provides investors with an additional measure of the size of the operations under our administration and can help them understand trends in our management fee revenue 
the acquisition of cypress on january  contributed additional revenue of  for the quarter ended march  revenues for the quarter ended june  include million for cost reimbursements under our case rate contract 
the acquisition of the aspen companies  effective july   contributed additional revenue of million for the quarter ended september  liquidity and capital resources on august   we consummated our initial public offering of common stock at which time we generated net proceeds of million and on september   as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  we generated additional net proceeds of million  for a total of million in net proceeds from that offering 
on april   we completed a follow on offering of common stock at which time we received net proceeds of approximately million

conversely  we repaid a million note to eos partners representing a consent fee in connection with our initial public offering and a financing fee of  to health care business credit corporation for a contemplated credit facility amendment in order for the company to increase its borrowing capacity under the line of credit and acquisition loan facilities 
additionally  we repaid amounts due under our revolving line of credit and capital lease agreements of  obligations and commitments credit facilities 
our amended loan and security agreement with healthcare business credit corporation  or hbcc  provides for a million revolving line of credit and a million acquisition term loan 
the amount we may borrow under the revolving line of credit is subject to the availability of a sufficient amount of eligible accounts receivable at the time of borrowing 
advances under the acquisition term loan are subject to the lender s approval 
initial proceeds borrowed under the revolving line of credit portion of this credit facility were used to repay and terminate our revolving line of credit with a former lender 
borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time  plus in the case of the revolving line of credit and prime plus in the case of the acquisition term loan 
in addition  we are subject to a fee per annum on the unused portion of our credit facility  as well as certain other administrative fees 
until its amendment in september  our credit facility with hbcc was secured by substantially all of our assets as well as certain of our managed entities assets 
prior to such amendment  the facility provided for a million term loan which we paid in full in august  and for the acquisition term loan to mature on january  on september   our loan and security agreement with hbcc was amended to remove  as co borrowers under the agreement  the not for profit organizations whose operations we manage and to release their assets from those pledged as collateral under the agreement 
the amendment also extended the maturity date of our acquisition term loan through december  the december  expiration date for the revolving line of credit  as well as the other provisions of our amended loan agreement remained the same as those set forth in our original january loan and security agreement 
concurrent with the amendment of our agreement  hbcc established stand alone credit facilities on behalf of each of the managed entities that were removed from our facility  and  while we do not guarantee any portion of their stand alone facilities  we have agreed in connection with the amendment of our loan and security agreement to subordinate our management fee receivable to the claims of hbcc in the event one of these managed entities defaults under its credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving line of credit and no borrowings under the acquisition term loan  available credit of million on our revolving line of credit  and we were in compliance with all covenants 
in connection with our acquisition of dockside  we issued two unsecured subordinated promissory notes each in the amount of  to the former stockholders of dockside in partial consideration for the purchase of all of dockside s outstanding stock 
each note bears interest equal to per annum with interest payable quarterly beginning april and total quarterly principal payments of  beginning april all unpaid principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due july we lease certain office equipment and furniture under agreements that are classified as capital leases 
at december   our obligations under capital lease agreements amounted to approximately  transactions with eos partners 
prior to the consummation of our initial public offering on august   we were required to obtain the consent of the then holders of our convertible preferred stock 
consequently  in connection with our initial public offering  we agreed to pay eos partners sbic and eos partners sbic ii  the then majority holders of our convertible preferred stock  a consent fee in the aggregate amount of million 
the consent fee was paid pursuant to two subordinated notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum 
on january   we prepaid the notes aggregate outstanding principal amount of million and paid all outstanding accrued interest on the notes  in the aggregate amount of  with proceeds from our initial public offering 
in addition  pursuant to an agreement dated june   eos partners sbic and eos partners sbic ii were paid an aggregate financial advisory fee in the amount of million upon our initial public offering out of proceeds from the offering 
management agreements we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations that require us to provide the management and administrative services for each organization 
in exchange for these services  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
additionally  prior to july   these management agreements contained a provision that permitted us to earn bonuses to our management fee dependent upon the managed entities operating results 
we have historically recognized such bonuses as revenue when they have been approved and authorized by the board of directors of the applicable not for profit entity and collection of such amount is determined to be probable 
in connection with the renegotiation of our fee arrangement with these entities  our management agreements with them were amended as of july   at which time the bonus provision was removed 
management fees generated under our management agreements represented and of our revenue for the years ended december  and fees generated under short term consulting agreements entered into in december and during represented approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
in accordance with our management agreements with these not for profit organizations  we have obligations to manage their business and services 
our management fee receivable is comprised of management fees we earn pursuant to our management agreements with certain not for profit social services organizations 
management fee receivable at december  and were million and million  and management fee revenues were recognized on all of these receivables 
in order to enhance liquidity of the entities we manage  we  at times  may allow the managed entities to defer payment of their respective management fees 
in addition  since government contractors who provide social or similar services to government beneficiaries sometimes experience collection delays due to either lack of proper documentation of claims  government budgetary processes or similar reasons outside the contractors control either directly or as managers of other contracting entities  we generally do not consider a receivable to be uncollectible due solely to its age until it is days old 
the following is a summary of the aging of our management fees receivable balances as of december  september  june  and march  and december  at less than days days days days over days december  march  june  september  december  we adhere to a strict revenue recognition policy regarding our management fee revenues and related receivables 
each month we examine each of our managed entities with regard to its solvency  outlook and ability to pay us any outstanding management fees 
if the likelihood that we will not be paid is other than remote  we will defer the recognition of these management fees until we are certain that payment is probable 
in keeping with our general corporate policy regarding our accounts receivable  we will also automatically reserve as uncollectible of any management fee receivable that is days old or older 
at december   none of our management fees receivable were older than days  and our days sales outstanding for our managed entities had decreased from days at december  to days at december  in addition  camelot community care  inc  which represented million  or  of our total management fee receivable at december   and intervention services inc  referred to as isi  which represented million  or  of our total management fee receivable at december   each obtained its own stand alone line of credit from hbcc in september the loan agreements between hbcc and these not for profit organizations permit them to use their credit facilities to pay our management fees  provided they are not in default under these facilities at the time of the payment 
as of december   they were each in compliance with all of their loan covenants with hbcc and camelot community care  inc had availability of  million under its line of credit as well as million in cash and cash equivalents and isi had availability of  under its line of credit as well as  in cash and cash equivalents 
camelot community care  inc has also entered into several new contracts  including its new contract with the state of florida  which provides for payments to camelot community care  inc in the amount of million per year commencing as of february  furthermore  in an effort to enhance liquidity and fund future growth opportunities at isi  we agreed with the board of directors of isi to lower our management fee percentage by three percentage points effective july  we expect the effect of the decrease in our management fee percentage will be partially offset by the july  florida medicaid rate increase from per hour to per hour  relating to of isi s contract revenues 
looking ahead  we do not expect a material decrease in our management fee from current levels as a result of the decrease in our management fee percentage with isi 
the remaining million balance of our total management fees receivable at december   was due from rio grande  redco  cdom  fcp and family preservation services of south carolina 
we have deemed payment of all of the foregoing receivables to be probable based on our collection history with these entities as the long term manager of their operations 
transactions with redco 
in connection with the acquisition of pottsville and the establishment of a management agreement with redco  we loaned  to redco to fund certain long term obligations of the entity in exchange for a promissory note for the same amount 
the note assumes interest equal to a fluctuating interest rate per annum based on a weighted average daily federal funds rate 
the terms of the promissory note require redco to make quarterly interest payments over twenty one months commencing june  with the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest due upon maturity on march  the promissory note is collateralized by a subordinated lien to redco s primary lender on substantially all of redco s assets 
contractual cash obligations 
the following is a summary of our future contractual cash obligations as of december  at december  contractual cash obligations s total less than year years years after years debt purchased services commitments leases total we expect our liquidity needs on a short and long term basis will be satisfied by cash flow from operations  the net proceeds from the sale of equity securities and borrowings under debt facilities 
our cash flow from operations is subject to the risks described under risk factors 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report on form k  such as any statements about our confidence or strategies or our expectations about revenues  results of operations  profitability  contracts or market opportunities  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about our business and our industry 
you can identify forward looking statements by the use of words such as may  should  will  could  estimates  predicts  potential  continue  anticipates  believes  plans  expects  future  and intends and similar expressions which are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements contained herein are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause our actual results or achievements to differ materially from those expressed  implied or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the risks described below under the heading risk factors 
risk factors changes in budgetary priorities of the government entities that fund the services we provide could result in our loss of contracts or a decrease in amounts payable to us under our contracts 
our revenue is largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid or funded by government agencies 
all of these contracts are subject to legislative appropriations and state budget approval 
consequently  a significant decline in government expenditures  shift of expenditures or funding away from programs that call for the types of services that we provide or change in government contracting or funding policies could cause payers to terminate their contracts with us or reduce their expenditures under those contracts  either of which could have a negative impact on our future operating results 
currently  all of the states in which we operate are facing budgetary shortfalls 
while to date we have not experienced any rate or contract reductions as a result of these budgetary shortfalls  we are not immune to such consequences 
in addition  in some states eligibility requirements for social services clients have been tightened to stabilize the number of eligible clients  which reduces the size of our potential market in those states 
while many of these states are dealing with budgetary concerns by shifting costs from institutional care to home and community based care such as we provide  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
our contracts are not only short term in nature but can also be terminated prior to expiration  without cause and without penalty to the payers  and there can be no assurance that they will survive until the end of their stated terms or that upon their expiration these contracts will be renewed or extended 
most of our contracts contain base periods of only one year 
while some of them also contain options for renewal  usually successive six month or one year terms  payers are not required to extend their contracts into these option periods 
in addition  a significant number of our contracts not only allow the payer to terminate the contract immediately for cause such as for our failure to meet our contract obligations but also permit the payer to terminate the contract at any time prior to its stated expiration date without cause  at will and without penalty to the payer  either upon the expiration of a short notice period  typically days  and or immediately  in the event federal or state appropriations supporting the programs serviced by the contract are reduced or eliminated 
while to date none of our contracts has been terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed or extended upon such expiration  the failure of payers to renew or extend significant contracts or their early termination of significant contracts could adversely affect our financial performance 
we cannot anticipate if  when or to what extent a payer might terminate its contract with us prior to its expiration or fail to renew or extend its contract with us 
each of our contracts is subject to audit and modification by the payers with whom we contract  in their sole discretion 
our business depends on our ability to successfully perform under various government funded contracts 
the payers under these contracts can review our performance with respect to their contracts  as well as our records  accounting and general business practices at any time and may  in their discretion suspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts because of violations or suspected violations of procurement laws or regulations  terminate or modify our existing contracts  reduce the amount we are paid under our existing contracts  and or audit and object to our contract related fees 
subject us to fines  penalties and sanctions  both criminal and civil 
as a government contractor  we are subject to an increased risk of litigation and other legal actions and liabilities 
as a government contractor  we are subject to an increased risk of investigation  criminal prosecution  civil fraud  whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities not often faced by companies that do not provide government sponsored services 
the occurrence of any of these actions  regardless of the outcome  could disrupt our operations and cause us added expense and could limit our ability to obtain additional contracts in other jurisdictions 
a loss of our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction could result in the termination of a number of our contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
if we lost our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction  the contracts under which we provide services in that jurisdiction would be subject to termination 
moreover  such an event could constitute a violation of provisions of our contracts in other jurisdictions  resulting in other contract terminations 
if we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations  we could be liable for damages and financial penalties and our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts could be damaged 
our failure to comply with our contract obligations could  in addition to providing grounds for immediate termination of the contract for cause  negatively impact our financial performance and damage our reputation  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain new contracts 
our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
the termination of a contract for cause could  for instance  subject us to liability for excess costs incurred by a payer in obtaining similar services from another source 
in addition  our contracts require us to indemnify payers for our failure to meet standards of care  and some of them contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties that we must pay if we breach these contracts 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few providers  which puts us at risk 
we provide  or manage the provision of  government sponsored social services pursuant to contracts 
one of these contracts  our contract with community partnership of southern arizona  or cpsa  an arizona not for profit organization  which is our oldest contract and our only annual block contract  generated approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  and of our revenues for the year ended december  our next five largest revenue producing contracts represented  in the aggregate  approximately and of our revenues for such periods 
the loss of  reduction in amounts generated by  or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services under these contracts could materially reduce our revenue 
our contract with cpsa was amended effective july   the provisions of which now require us to provide a sufficient level of encounters to support the year to date payments received under the amended contract and provide necessary services that may exceed the associated reimbursement 
effective july   we began operating under an annual block purchase contract with cpsa 
in exchange for one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month  the agreement specifies that we are to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to certain eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete continuum of services including but not limited to intake  assessment  eligibility  case management and therapeutic services 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a limit to the level of services that must be provided to these beneficiaries 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 
we are required to regularly submit service encounters to the payer electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of the payer s june fiscal year  the payer is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if at any time the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  the payer has the right to suspend payments to us or recoup funds paid to us 
we recognize revenue from this contract equal to the lesser of encounter value  which represents the actual level of services rendered  or the contract amount 
for the six months ended december   revenues under the annual block purchase contract totaled million 
the payer has not suspended payments to us nor have we returned any amounts to the payer 
while we do not anticipate that we will be required to return any amounts to the payer and that our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts paid to us under the amended contract  there can be no assurances that this will be the case 
if we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts  we may incur losses on these contracts 
under our fee for service contracts  we receive fees based on our interactions with government sponsored clients 
to earn a profit on these contracts  we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services 
our risk on these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs  such as rent and other overhead 
our fee for service contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore  if we fail to estimate our costs accurately  we may incur losses on these contracts 
approximately of our revenues are derived from certain cost based service contracts in california where we record revenue at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies  which put us at risk 
with our acquisition of the aspen companies  we acquired certain cost based service contracts that require us to allow for contingencies such as budgeted costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or insufficient encounters 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
while we obtain some of our business through responses to government requests for proposals  we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future  and contracts we are awarded may not be profitable 
we obtain  and will continue to seek to obtain  a significant portion of our business from state or local government entities 
to obtain business from government entities  we are often required to respond to requests for proposals  or rfps 
to propose effectively  we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract  the time required to establish operations and the terms of the proposals submitted by competitors 
we must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables 
our ability to respond successfully to rfps will greatly impact our business 
we may not be awarded contracts through the rfp process  and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts 
if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with officials of government entities and agencies  we may not be able to successfully procure or retain government sponsored contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
to facilitate our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts  we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies 
these relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an rfp or program for privatization of social services and enhance our chances of procuring contracts with these payers 
the effectiveness of our relationships may be reduced or eliminated with changes in the personnel holding various government offices or staff positions 
we also may lose key personnel who have these relationships 
we may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees 
any failure to establish  maintain or manage relationships with government and agency personnel may hinder our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts 
the federal government may refuse to grant consents and or waivers necessary to permit for profit entities to perform certain elements of government programs 
under current law  in order to privatize certain functions of government programs the federal government must grant a consent and or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency 
if the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver or withdraw approval of any granted waiver  the state or local agency will be unable to contract with a for profit entity  such as us  to provide the service 
failure by state or local agencies to obtain consents and or waivers could adversely affect our continued business and future growth 
our business could be adversely affected by future legislative changes that hinder or reverse the privatization of social services 
the market for our services depends largely on federal  state and local legislative programs 
these programs can be modified or amended at any time 
moreover  part of our growth strategy includes aggressively pursuing opportunities created by the federal  state and local initiatives to privatize the delivery of social services 
however  there are opponents to the privatization of social services and  as a result  future privatization of social services is uncertain 
if additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted  or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged  repealed or invalidated  our growth could be adversely impacted 
in addition  even some currently proposed privatization initiatives could be harmful to us 
for instance  as disclosed below  the current presidential led faith based initiative  if successful  could cause contracts and revenues to be diverted from us to religious based social service organizations 
there are legislative proposals being considered which  if enacted  would favor faith based providers of social services over us 
currently  we compete with faith based agencies  such as catholic social services  jewish family and children s services and the salvation army 
if the current presidential led initiative to favor faith based social service providers is enacted as legislation  our ability to obtain new contracts or to renew existing contracts could be jeopardized  which could negatively impact our operating results 
our strategic relationships with certain not for profit and tax exempt entities are subject to tax and other risks 
since some government agencies prefer or require contracts for privatized social services to be administered through not for profit organizations  we rely heavily on our relationships with not for profit organizations to provide services to these government agencies 
we currently maintain strategic relationships with six not for profit  tax exempt social services organizations with which we have long term management contracts 
these organizations are family preservation services of south carolina  inc  camelot community care  inc  intervention services  inc  rio grande behavioral health services  inc  care development of maine and fcp  inc 
federal tax laws require that the boards of directors of not for profit tax exempt organizations be independent 
although currently the boards of directors of the tax exempt not for profit organizations for which we provide management services are independent  in the past our employees constituted a majority of the boards of family preservation services of south carolina  inc  camelot community care  inc 
and intervention services  inc if  as a result of such past practices  we and or the managed entities were ever found to be in violation of these federal tax laws  we and the managed entities could be subject to penalties and  as described below  the tax exempt status of these managed entities could be jeopardized 
federal tax laws also require that the management fees we charge the not for profit entities we manage be at fair market rates 
prior to july  however  these management contracts contained a provision that permitted us to earn bonuses to our management fee dependent upon the managed entity s operating results 
in connection with our renegotiation of our fee arrangement with these entities  we amended these agreements as of july   at which time we removed the bonus provision 
if the internal revenue service  referred to as the irs  determined that any tax exempt organization was paying more than market rates for services performed by us  and further determined that we were  at the time those rates were set  in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the tax exempt organization through our past majority positions on the board of directors or otherwise  the irs could sanction us and the tax exempt organization  including levying a penalty against us of of the amount paid in excess of the market rates for the services provided and the return of all excess benefit amounts  plus interest  to the tax exempt organization 
if the excess benefit amount were not returned  an additional penalty equal to of the excess benefit could be imposed on us 
in addition  until september  three of these not for profit organizations family preservation services of south carolina  camelot community care  inc and intervention services were co borrowers on our credit facility and their receivables were pledged as additional collateral under the facility 
as the manager of these entities  we drew down on the line of credit under our credit facility on their behalf and advanced the borrowings to them for their operating expenses 
in september  these entities were removed as co borrowers under our credit facility  and their assets were removed as collateral from our line of credit 
as a result of our relationships with these tax exempt organizations  including our employees past majority positions on the boards of directors of some of them  the terms of our management contracts with these organizations and or the shared borrowing relationship we previously had with some of them  the irs could propose to revoke the tax exempt status of some or all of these tax exempt organizations 
if the irs were successful in revoking the tax exempt status of any of these tax exempt organizations  such organization would likely be treated as a taxable entity from the time of the event or events that caused the exempt status to be revoked 
in addition  state authorities could investigate and take action against the not for profit status of these organizations for similar reasons 
a state attorney general could also take action to dissolve a state not for profit organization that could result in our loss of the organization s contract s for services 
the loss of federal tax exempt and or not for profit status would adversely affect the ability of these organizations to be exempt from certain federal taxes and could have the same impact on state taxes 
the imposition of federal and or state taxes on such organizations could reduce the funds available to pay our management fees 
further  these organizations existing payers may terminate or fail to renew or extend their contracts with the tax exempt organizations if irs or state controversies of this type were threatened or were to occur 
the loss of such contracts could have a negative effect on our earnings 
government unions may oppose privatizing government programs to outside vendors such as us  which could limit our market opportunities 
our success depends in part on our ability to win contracts to administer and manage programs traditionally administered by government employees 
many government employees  however  belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks 
these unions could apply political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to privatize government programs 
union opposition could result in our losing government contracts or being precluded from providing services under government contracts 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to procure government sponsored contracts 
the media sometimes provides news coverage about our contracts and the services we provide to clients 
this media coverage  if negative  could influence government officials to slow the pace of privatizing government services 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to obtain government sponsored contracts 
we may incur costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from payers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve government budgets in a timely manner 
moreover  any resulting cash shortfall could be exacerbated if we fail to either invoice the payer or to collect our fee in a timely manner 
our business is subject to risks of litigation 
we are in the human services business and therefore are subject to claims alleging we did not properly treat an individual or failed to properly diagnose and or care for a client 
we carry professional liability and general liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence  per occurrence and  annual aggregate for physical or sexual abuse 
the annual combined policy aggregate limit is million with a  self insured retention 
a substantial award could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flow and could adversely impact our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance 
we are also subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct in addition to professional liability claims by an employee  including but not limited to  claims arising out of accidents involving employees driving to or from interactions with clients or assault and battery 
we are also subject to employee related claims such as wrongful discharge or discrimination or a violation of equal employment law 
while we are insured for these types of claims  damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage  such as a claim for fraud  could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition 
furthermore  we are subject to miscellaneous errors and omissions liability relative to the various management agreements we have with the not for profit entities we manage 
in the event of a claim and depending on  among other things  the circumstances  allegations  and size of the management contract  we could be subject to damages that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face substantial competition in attracting and retaining experienced personnel  and we may be unable to grow our business if we cannot attract and retain qualified employees 
our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced social service professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high quality services to our clients 
our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is strongly considered when we evaluate education  experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff 
to that end  we attempt to hire professionals who have attained a bachelors degree  masters degree or higher level of education and certification or licensure as direct care social service providers and administrators 
these employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we must quickly hire project leaders and case management personnel after a contract is awarded to us 
contract provisions and client needs determine the number  education and experience levels of social service professionals we hire 
we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract 
currently  we maintain an average staff to client ratio of one to eight 
our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including  but not limited to  our ability to offer competitive wages  benefits and professional growth opportunities 
some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
the inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
since  our business has grown significantly in size and complexity 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our management  systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
in addition  we expect that we will need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
the nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
any acquisition that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we anticipate that we will continue making strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we have made several acquisitions since our inception  including camelot care corporation in march  cypress management services  inc in january  dockside services  inc 
in january  pottsville behavioral counseling group  inc in may and  in july  the aspen companies 
the success of these and other acquisitions depends in part on our ability to integrate acquired companies into our business operations 
there can be no assurance that the companies acquired will continue to generate income at the same historical levels on which we based our acquisition decisions  that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies contracts  that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services  expand our markets or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with some acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership and or we could incur or assume substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following problems assimilating the purchased operations  unanticipated costs and legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  entering markets in which we have limited or no experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  the incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition  failure to maintain and renew contracts  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition  and dilution to our earnings per share 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition  and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 
our future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition 
although we currently have minimal outstanding debt  we may incur debt in the future in connection with our acquisition strategy and for other corporate opportunities 
if we do so  these debt obligations could pose risk to you by making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate requirements  impeding us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes  and making us more vulnerable if a downturn in our business occurs and limiting our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business 
if we were to fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in these agreements  we would be in default 
a default could have a significant adverse effect on the market value and marketability of our common stock 
our lenders would have the ability to require that we immediately pay all outstanding indebtedness 
if the lenders were to require immediate payment  we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our credit facility  our subordinated notes or our other indebtedness 
in such event  we could be forced to seek protection under bankruptcy laws  which could have a material adverse effect on our existing contracts and our ability to procure new contracts as well as our ability to recruit and or retain employees 
the cost of additional equity or debt capital could be prohibitive or result in dilution to existing stockholders 
as we continue to grow  we may seek to raise additional capital to fund our investments and or operations 
any additional capital may consist of public or private equity or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that  if and when needed  additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is needed and not available  we may need to change our business strategy to slow our rate of expansion or reduce our operations 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace 
we compete for clients and for contracts with payers with a variety of organizations that offer similar services 
most of our competition consists of local social service organizations that compete with us for local contracts  such as united way supported agencies and faith based agencies such as catholic social services  jewish family and children s services and the salvation army 
other competitors include local  not for profit organizations and community based organizations 
historically  these types of organizations have been favored in our industry as incumbent providers of services to government entities 
we also compete with larger companies  such as maximus  inc  whose government operations group administers and manages welfare program services  childcare support enforcement  medicaid enrollment and other consulting services for state and local governments 
national mentor  inc is the country s largest provider of foster care services and competes with us in existing markets for foster care services 
in addition  many institutional providers offer some type of community based care including such organizations as cornell companies  inc  res care  inc  psychiatric solutions  inc and the devereaux foundation 
some of these companies have greater financial  technical  political  marketing  name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients and or payers than we do 
in addition  some of these companies offer more services than we do 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  competition from new entrants into our markets 
increased competition may result in pricing pressures  loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers  any of which could harm our business 
our business is subject to state licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions  including regulatory provisions governing surveys  audits  anti kickbacks  anti referrals  false claims and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  and changes to or violations of these regulations could negatively impact our revenues 
in many of the locations where we operate  we are required to obtain and maintain licenses 
the applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide  the credentials of staff  record keeping  treatment planning  client monitoring and supervision of staff 
the failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on our business and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction 
most of our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payers 
we are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency 
such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payers 
in addition  we are or may be subject to anti kickback  anti referral and false claim laws  which impose penalties and possible bars from obtaining government contracts 
the penalties could include criminal fines  civil money penalties  damages  imprisonment and or a ban from participation in federally funded healthcare programs 
such fines and penalties could negatively impact our business by decreasing profits due to costs of fines and damages  damaging our reputation and diverting our management resources 
due to our access  use or disclosure of health information relating to individuals  we are subject to the privacy mandates of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
hipaa mandates  among other things  the adoption of standards to enhance the efficiency and simplify the administration of the nation s healthcare system 
hipaa requires the department of health and human services to adopt standards for electronic transactions and code sets for basic healthcare transactions such as payment  eligibility and remittance advices  or transaction standards  privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy standards  security and electronic signatures  or security standards  as well as unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals and enforcement 
final regulations have been issued for the privacy standards  transaction standards and security standards 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply in our operations with these standards and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 
in addition  in connection with providing services to customers that also are healthcare providers  we are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to those customers that we will provide those services in accordance with the privacy standards 
hipaa has and will require significant and costly changes for our company and others in the healthcare industry 
the privacy standards went into effect in april and the transaction standards went into effect in october the effective date for compliance with the security standards is april we have appointed an internal committee to set our privacy policies regarding client information in compliance with hipaa 
this committee is responsible for training our employees  including our regional and local managers and staff  to comply with hipaa policy and monitoring compliance with the policy 
however  like other businesses subject to hipaa regulations  we cannot fully predict the total financial or other impact of these regulations on us 
we anticipate  however  that it will cost us approximately  to comply with the hipaa security standards by april in addition  the costs that may be associated with our ongoing compliance with the new hipaa regulations could be substantial  which could negatively impact our profitability 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained above and throughout this report 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date the statement was made 
we do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk upon the consummation of our initial public offering  we repaid all of the principal and accrued interest outstanding under our loan and security agreements 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit and no borrowings under our acquisition term loan 
in connection with our acquisition of dockside  we issued two subordinated notes each in the amount of  to the sellers 
the notes bear a fixed interest rate of 
on september   we purchased a million zero coupon bond  at  or million  issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
on july   the bond matured with a market value of million 
we believe our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates is immaterial at this time 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our debt instruments 
we assess the significance of interest rate market risk on a periodic basis and may implement strategies to manage such risk as we deem appropriate 
concentration of credit risk we provide and manage government sponsored social services to individuals and families pursuant to contracts 
among these contracts there are certain contracts under which we generate a significant portion of our revenue 
we generated approximately million  or of our revenues for the year ended december   pursuant to one contract in arizona with the community partnership of southern arizona  an arizona not for profit organization 
this contract is subject to statutory and regulatory changes  possible prospective rate adjustments and other retroactive contractual adjustments  administrative rulings  rate freezes and funding reductions 
reductions in amounts paid by this contract for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services could materially adversely affect our revenue 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  finalized sfas r  share based payment  effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after june  sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
retroactive application of the requirements of sfas r to the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the effective date is permitted  but not required 
we plan to implement sfas r beginning july  and we are in the process of determining the affect this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements
