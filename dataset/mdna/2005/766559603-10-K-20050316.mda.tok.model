when used herein  the words believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  plan and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that these statements will prove to be correct 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ significantly from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors in part i  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
you should consider our forward looking statements in light pf the risks discussed in risk factors  as well as our financial statements  related notes  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
rigel undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any future events or developments 
overview rigel pharmaceuticals  inc discovers and develops novel  small molecule compounds for the treatment of large  unmet medical needs 
our objective is to create a portfolio of product candidates that can be developed for our own proprietary programs and with potential collaborative partners 
our productive discovery engine enables us to move one product candidate into the clinic each year 
currently  we have product development programs for the indications of allergy asthma  rheumatoid arthritis  hepatitis c and cancer 
our objective is creating a portfolio of product candidates that can be developed into small molecule therapeutics for our own proprietary programs and with potential collaborative partners 
we believe that producing a portfolio of many product candidates and working in conjunction with pharmaceutical companies increases our probability of commercial success 
the product development process is one that is subject to both high costs and high risk of failure 
we believe that this approach allows us to minimize the risk of failure  while concurrently strategically placing us in a position to help fill the continuing product pipeline gap at major pharmaceutical companies 
over the last couple of years  we have matured into a drug development company with multiple product candidates in candidates in various stages of development 
r product candidate for allergic rhinitis 
we completed a phase i clinical trial of r in patients in december  a single dose phase i ii clinical trial of patients in june and a multi dose safety trial of patients in december in april  we initiated a phase ii park study clinical trial in which we measured allergic symptom improvement 
on august   we announced the results of this trial  which demonstrate r can reduce certain symptoms of allergic rhinitis in a statistically significant manner compared to placebo  has a favorable safety profile  and has a rapid onset of action in symptom improvement 
based on these results we plan to move r forward in clinical development with an additional phase ii trial in r product candidate for rheumatoid arthritis 
in january  we selected r as our lead product candidate to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
phase i clinical trials were initiated in december with the results of this trial expected in the next few months 
r product candidate for oncology 
in july  we selected r as our lead product candidate for initial clinical trials in oncology and expect to file and ind in the second half of r anti hepatitis c virus product candidate 
we completed our initial phase i clinical trial of r in january we commenced a phase i ii clinical trial of r in the united states in mid and in november  we reported that r did not achieve the desired viral titer reduction 
we are currently examining various alternatives and expect to determine our next steps within the next few months 
in addition to the above mentioned product candidates  we have ongoing research programs involving back up candidates for the four product candidates above as well as drug discovery efforts in our immunology  virology  and oncology programs 
corporate collaborations in addition to the preceding programs in which we retain all commercial and economic rights  we also carry on research and development programs in connection with our corporate collaborations 
as of december   we have collaborations with five major pharmaceutical companies  including one with janssen pharmaceutica nv  a division of johnson johnson  relating to oncology therapeutics and diagnostics  two with pfizer inc  one initiated in and the other in  relating to asthma and allergy therapeutics  one with novartis pharma ag with respect to four different programs relating to immunology  oncology and chronic bronchitis  one with daiichi pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
in the area of oncology  and one with merck  also in the area of oncology 
these collaborations all have a research phase during which we receive or received funding based on the level of headcount allocated to a program 
in all of these collaborations  after the research phase concludes  if certain conditions are met  we are entitled to receive future milestone payments and royalties 
we cannot guarantee that these conditions will be met or that research and development efforts will be successful 
as a result  we may be precluded from receiving any milestone payments or royalties under these agreements 
only the daiichi and merck programs are currently in the research phase of their respective agreements and provide for regular research reimbursement payments 
the research phase of the daiichi collaboration will end in august we are exploring new opportunities with existing and potential collaborators 
our earliest partnerships focused on the early stages of drug discovery  specifically on target discovery and validation 
our collaborations with daiichi and recently with merck are both later stage focusing on drug discovery and development 
our collaboration with pfizer covered compounds at the preclinical and lead designation stages 
we currently anticipate that in order to support our current research programs we will need to self fund our own research programs  which involve an increased rate of spending  to later stages of development prior to partnering with collaborative partners 
therefore  it is expected that future collaborations may have an expanded focus and could include hts  combinatorial and medicinal chemistry  preclinical evaluations and or clinical development of compounds we have discovered 
in addition  we believe these future collaborations could be structured to consist of upfront payments  milestone payments upon meeting certain conditions  research reimbursement payments and or royalties upon commercialization of products resulting from the collaboration 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of the research collaborations  investments  stock compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our contract arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
revenues related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result if we were not to incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
milestones are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of these specified at risk milestones 
royalties are expected to be recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands stock based compensation from re priced options    consultant options other employee options  total    re priced options we record charges associated with the stock options that were eligible for re pricing under a tender offer initiated in june all replacement options  as well as the eligible options that were not surrendered under the original offer to exchange  are being treated for financial reporting purposes as variable awards 
therefore  we are recording a non cash charge recovery  generally for the intrinsic value of the options as they vest  utilizing the graded vesting method  reflecting increases and decreases down to  but not below  the exercise price in the price of our common stock as compensation expense recovery in connection with the replacement options and the eligible options that were not exchanged 
we expect to continue to reflect increases and decreases in the price of our common stock in our statement of operations with respect to these options until they are exercised  forfeited or terminated 
the higher the market value of our common stock  the greater the compensation expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash compensation charge of million related to all options eligible for the replacement until the options are exercised  forfeited  or terminated 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash compensation charge of million related to all options eligible for the replacement 
in both years  the charge resulted from the increase in the market price of our common stock during the respective year 
we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of sfas r related to our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
consultant options we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the periodic revaluation of outstanding unvested consultant options based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price 
we recognized stock based compensation for revaluation of consultant options of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized stock based compensation recovery for the revaluation of consultant options of  for the year ended december  we expect to see continued fluctuations in the future as a portion of these options are revalued based on the changes in the current market price of our common stock through the application of the graded vesting method 
other employee options we recorded  of deferred stock compensation for the year ended december  we recorded no deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees for the years ended december  and the amount recorded in related to an option grant to a certain executive officer that was modified to reduce the vesting term 
this amount has been reflected as a component of stockholders equity  and the deferred expense is being amortized to operations over the remaining vesting period of the option grant using the graded vesting method 
as a result of our reduction in force on january   we recognized approximately  of stock based compensation recovery associated with the unvested and cancelled options of the terminated employees which had previously been recognized under the graded vesting method of deferred compensation amortization 
we amortized deferred stock compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had a total of  remaining to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands contract revenues from collaborations    revenues by collaborator were aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands daiichi     novartis      merck johnson johnson    pfizer total      contract revenues from collaborations in  and consisted primarily of research support and amortization of upfront fees from the continuation of our collaborations 
revenues for and also included milestone payments from certain collaborators 
the decrease in revenues of million was primarily due to the termination of the research phase of the novartis oncology program and the termination of the research phase of the johnson johnson oncology program 
also  revenues in included a million milestone payment from daiichi for the completion of a certain screening phase of the collaboration 
the overall decrease in revenues in of million was primarily due to the termination of the research phase of the novartis t cell and b cell programs and the termination of the research phase of the pfizer collaboration 
the decrease in revenues in was offset by the million milestone payment from daiichi and a full year of revenue from the daiichi collaboration 
as of december   only daiichi and merck were in the research phase of their agreements 
the research phase of the daiichi collaboration ends in july while the research phase of the merck collaboration ends in may in january  we signed a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer for the development of inhaled products for the treatment of allergic asthma and other respiratory diseases focusing on our small molecule compounds that inhibit syk kinase 
we expect contract revenues from collaborations to continue to be a significant component of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
research and development aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands research and development expenses     stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses   the increase in research and development expenses of million in was primarily attributable to an increase in our preclinical and clinical costs and a stock based compensation expense charge related to the re priced stock options subject to variable accounting  as discussed previously under stock based compensation in the critical accounting policies and the use of estimates section 
the increase in our clinical costs in was attributable to costs associated with our phase ii clinical trial for r  our phase i ii clinical trial for r  and our phase i clinical trial for r the increase in our pre clinical costs in was primarily attributable to the studies performed with r to enable the initiation of clinical trials in december the increase in research and development expenses of million in was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in our facility costs associated with the move to our new building in february offset by reductions in contract chemistry  lab supplies  and research headcount 
the increase in was also attributable to the stock based compensation expense charge related to the re priced stock options subject to variable accounting 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development therefore results in increasing expenditures 
our research and development expenditures currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and stock based compensation 
because of the number of research projects we have ongoing at any one time  and the ability to utilize resources across several projects  the majority of our research and development costs are not directly tied to any individual project and are allocated among multiple projects 
our project management is based primarily on scientific data and supplemented by these cost allocations  which are based primarily on human resource time incurred on each project 
as a result  the costs allocated to a project do not necessarily reflect the actual costs of the project 
general and administrative expenses aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands general and administrative expenses    stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in was primarily attributable to an increase in our intellectual property legal costs to expand our patent estate  an increase in our stock based compensation expense charge related to the re priced stock options subject to variable accounting  as discussed previously under stock based compensation in the critical accounting policies and the use of estimates section  and an increase in personnel related costs associated with our bonus plan 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million in was primarily attributable to a decrease in our intellectual property legal costs and personnel related costs offset by an increase in our facility costs associated with the move to our new building in february loss on disposal sale of property and equipment years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands loss on disposal sale of property and equipment during  we wrote off  of assets at their original acquisition cost and related accumulated depreciation of  for assets that are no longer in use 
we recorded loss on disposal of property and equipment of  in conjunction with our move to our new facilities in february  we sold to the new tenant of our previous facility certain furniture and equipment that would no longer be needed at our new location 
this sale resulted in cash proceeds of approximately  and a loss on sale of  the loss represents the remaining net book value of those assets net of the cash received on the sale 
net interest income expense aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands net interest income expense interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances  whereas interest expense is the result of our capital lease obligations associated with fixed asset acquisitions 
in  interest income exceeded interest expense due primarily to the increase in our cash and investment balances resulting from our follow on offering completed early in in and  interest expense exceeded interest income primarily due to a reduction in interest rates earned on investment balances 
future accounting requirements at its march meeting  the eitf reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf the consensus clarified the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and to investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
in september  the fasb delayed indefinitely the recognition and measurement guidance to be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations  however the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our year ended december  we will evaluate the effect  if any  of recognition and measurement provisions of eitf issue when final guidance is released 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement nos 
accounting for stock based compensation 
and  statement of cash flows 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates accounting for share based compensation transactions using apb accounting for stock issued to employees and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method  thereby requiring companies to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
this statement is required to be adopted by us beginning july  the cumulative effect of adoption applied on a modified prospective basis would be measured and recognized beginning july  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of sfas r related to our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method reflected in note to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted by us in compliance with sfas r 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments payable to us under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated proceeds from current collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through at least the next twelve months 
our operations will require significant additional funding in large part due to our research and development expenses  future preclinical and clinical testing costs  our facility lease commitments and the absence of any meaningful revenues for the foreseeable future 
the amount of future funds needed will depend largely on the timing and structure of potential future collaborations 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date  and operating expenditures are expected to increase over the next several years as we expand our research and development activities 
on october   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for the proposed offering  from time to time  of up to million of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and or warrants 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders would at that time experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to establish new collaborations and to maintain our existing collaboration partnerships  the progress of research programs carried out at rigel  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and expenses associated with unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to net proceeds of million  after deducting offering costs  from the follow on offering completed in february and march in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
these financing proceeds were offset by approximately million in net cash used in operating activities 
we also made debt service payments of million in conjunction with our equipment financing arrangements 
for the year ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  federal agency securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
contractual obligations the following are our contractual commitments by fiscal year as of december  associated with debt obligations  contracted research obligations  and lease obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands in thousands debt obligations   contracted research facilities leases  net of sublease    total      as of december   we had million in debt obligations associated with our equipment additions 
all existing debt agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at rates in a range of to and are due in monthly installments through during may  we initiated a sublease of approximately  square feet of our premises to a tenant for a period of two years 
the facilities lease obligations below are reflective of the new sublease income stream 
on january  we entered into an amendment with the landlord for our facilities to decrease the contractual rental commitments in by approximately million 
this change is reflected in the table below 
the payments above also reflect the fifteen years of the lease term 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
you should read note of the notes to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  federal agency securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
