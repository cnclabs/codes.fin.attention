item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are creating a pipeline of novel therapeutics based on our proprietary transcription factor decoy  or tf decoy  technology 
we evaluated our lead product candidate  ef decoy  a combination drug and delivery device  in two phase clinical trials during for the prevention of vein graft failure 
the first of the two phase trials  called prevent iii  which evaluated ef decoy in patients undergoing peripheral bypass graft surgeries in the leg  did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints 
the second of the two phase trials  called prevent iv  is evaluating patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft  or cabg  surgeries 
we and bms are planning to meet by the end of march with the food and drug administration  or fda  prior to unblinding the data from prevent iv 
whether we unblind and announce our prevent iv data prior to the end of march  as was previously anticipated  will depend on the timing and results of our meeting with the fda 
we are also developing ef decoy for the prevention of arterio venous  or av  graft failure and completed enrollment of a phase clinical trial for this indication in late ef decoy has received fast track designation from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for both the prevention of vein graft failure and av graft failure 
in october  we entered into a worldwide collaborative agreement with bristol myers squibb company  or bms  for the development and commercialization of ef decoy for all indications 
we have an additional tf decoy in clinical development for the treatment of eczema and preclinical development for the treatment of other inflammatory diseases and an additional tf decoy in pre clinical development for the treatment of cancer 
we are focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of a new class of therapeutics called transcription factor decoys 
our tf decoys are synthetically manufactured short strands of dna that specifically bind to and block the activity of their target transcription factors 
transcription factors are specialized dna binding proteins and are widely recognized as excellent therapeutic targets because they control gene expression and biological processes 
because abnormal gene expression is a fundamental cause of many diseases  controlling the regulators  the transcription factors  offers an attractive therapeutic approach 
we believe that tf decoys may offer advantages over existing therapeutic approaches because a single tf decoy can target multiple genes involved in a specific disease process 
we are focused on tf decoys initially for the treatment of cardiovascular disease  inflammatory disease  such as eczema  and cancer 
we were incorporated in january since our inception  our only revenues have been derived from our recent collaboration with bristol myers squibb company  or bms  and we have incurred significant losses each year 
we have funded our operations since inception primarily through the private placement of equity securities 
we generated net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  and will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
in october  we entered into global collaboration agreements with bms for the development and commercialization of ef decoy for all indications 
we and bms will co promote ef decoy in the united states and share equally in profits and losses 
we have granted bms the exclusive right to commercialize ef decoy outside the united states pursuant to a royalty bearing license 
under our agreements with bms  bms is obligated to fund a majority of the ongoing development costs associated with ef decoy 
in september  we licensed a novel peptide delivery system from cyclacel limited  or cyclacel  for potential use in assisting in the systemic delivery of tf decoys 
the license grants us use of cyclacel s proprietary penetratin delivery technology with tf decoys 
we paid cyclacel an up front payment and will pay cyclacel milestone payments and royalties if licensed products are commercialized 
in december  we entered into an agreement with avecia limited for the manufacture of a ef single strand intermediates  b nf kb decoy single strand intermediates and hybridized duplex products  and c hif decoy single strand intermediates 
we paid avecia an up front payment of million and will pay avecia up to an additional of million plus reimbursement for raw materials upon the achievement of certain manufacturing and product delivery milestones 
on march  we and avecia limited amended our december  agreement for the manufacture of a ef single strand intermediates  b nf kb decoy single strand intermediates and hybridized duplex products  and c hif decoy single strand intermediates 
the amendment extended by one month the period during which avecia would manufacture certain materials for an additional payment by us of million plus reimbursement for raw materials 
the agreement was previously amended on march  to specify the amount of reimbursement to be paid by us for previously used raw materials 
the agreement does not provide for the production of material for commercial sale 
financial operations overview revenues we have not generated any revenues from sales of commercial products since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue  other than contract revenues and milestone payments  until at least the end of bms will have the right to record all united states product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses represent costs incurred for the discovery of novel tf decoys  our preclinical and clinical trials  activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we utilize a combination of internal resources and independent contractors to manage our clinical trials 
the manufacturing activities related to product for clinical trials are conducted by third parties 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the following table shows the allocation of research and development expenses to ef decoy and all other activities 
year ended december  in thousands ef decoy    nf kb decoy   other activities    total research and development expenses    during the years ended december  and and  we incurred research and development expenses totaling million 
of this amount  approximately million was spent on activities required to advance the development of our clinical product candidate  ef decoy  through full enrollment of phase clinical trials 
the remaining amount of million was expended primarily on employee costs  supplies and materials and infrastructure related to chemistry and related functions associated with our early stage research activities 
during the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses for ef decoy of approximately million 
in october  we entered into our collaboration agreement with bms  under which bms is obligated to fund a majority of the ongoing costs of developing ef decoy for graft failure 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in reimbursable expenses due from bms  as contract revenue  related party 
we currently have two clinical product candidates  ef decoy and nf kb decoy 
we and bms are planning to meet by the end of march with the fda prior to unblinding the data from prevent iv 
whether we unblind and announce the prevent iv data prior to the end of march  as was previously anticipated  will depend on the timing and results of our meeting with the fda 
until we meet with the fda and unblind the data  we cannot forecast the results of the prevent iv trial nor accurately estimate the expenses to complete the development of ef decoy 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  facilities  other general corporate activities and non cash stock compensation 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  stock compensation and clinical trial accounting are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues associated with our collaboration with bms consist of non refundable  up front license fees and reimbursement of development expenses 
we use revenue recognition criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  or eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf accordingly  we recognize revenues from licensing agreements based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
non refundable up front fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are generally recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and amortized into license fees in the statements of operations over the estimated term of the performance obligation 
to date we have received million from bms in non refundable up front fees in consideration for license and distribution rights of ef decoy 
in determining the term of performance obligation  we took into account the estimated period to complete clinical trials and receive regulatory approvals for commercialization of ef decoy in cabg and av grafts based upon the most recent development plans for each product 
if such plans are modified  the timing of recognition of deferred revenue will change 
in addition  the manufacturing and co promotion arrangements were not considered to be deliverables as defined under eitf stock compensation we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and related interpretations and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by apb no 
the information regarding net loss as required by sfas no 
 presented in note to our financial statements  has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
the resulting effect on net loss pursuant to sfas no 
is not likely to be representative of the effects on net loss pursuant to sfas no 
in future years  since future years are likely to include additional grants and the irregular impact of future years vesting 
stock compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option grants at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock 
stock compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
from inception through december   we recorded deferred stock compensation expense of million which is amortized over the vesting period of the options 
at december   we had a total of million remaining to be amortized 
the total unamortized deferred stock compensation is expected to be amortized as follows million during the year ending december   million during the year ending december   million during the year ending december  and  during the year ending december  clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations and participating hospitals 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up hospital sites for participation in trials are accrued immediately 
hospital costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
payments to hospitals for post surgery patient angiograms are accrued at the time of the performance of the angiogram 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue  related party 
contract revenue  related party was million for the three months and for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the higher revenue in was primarily attributable to reimbursement by bms of million in expenses associated with ef decoy research and development and revenue recognition of million of deferred revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses of million was primarily the result of an increase of million in payroll and non cash compensation expenses  million in expenses associated with manufacturing development activities  and million in expenses associated with the research development of new drug candidates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to an increase of million in payroll and non cash stock compensation expenses  million in expenses associated with developing the infrastructure necessary to support the potential commercialization of ef decoy  and million in costs associated with becoming a publicly traded company in interest and other income 
interest and other income increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of higher average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances from proceeds from our initial public offering 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  decreased due to the decrease in non cash interest expense from the bridge loan in year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue  related party 
contract revenue  related party was for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the reimbursement by bms of million in expenses associated with ef decoy research and development and the recognition of million of deferred revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development of million was primarily the result of an increase of million in expenses associated with the expansion of our clinical development programs relating to ef decoy  million in expenses associated with manufacturing development activities  and higher payroll and non cash stock compensation expenses of million as we increased our personnel 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher payroll and non cash stock compensation expenses and related expenses of million as we increased our personnel and  related to increased legal and patent expenses 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a result of lower average cash balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  included a charge of million related to the estimated fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with convertible notes issued in september and october and an associated beneficial conversion feature on these notes of million 
income taxes at december   we had net operating loss and research carryforwards for federal income taxes of million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in our utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  and similar state provisions  as a result of changes in our ownership structure 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
at december   and  we had deferred tax assets representing the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and certain start up costs capitalized for tax purposes 
we did not record a benefit for the deferred tax assets because realization of the benefit was uncertain and  accordingly  a valuation allowance is provided to offset the deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  capital equipment financing and payments from bms pursuant to our recent collaboration 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and had  of restricted cash pledged as collateral for letters of credit for our leased facilities 
in february  we issued  shares of common stock at per share upon the closing of our initial public offering in which we raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses 
pursuant to our collaboration agreement  bms has agreed to fund a majority of ongoing development costs incurred towards the development of ef decoy for the prevention of bypass graft failure and prevention of av graft failure 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and expected reimbursements of development costs from bms will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations through at least mid cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million for this consisted primarily of a net loss for the period of million plus decrease in deferred revenue  accrued clinical trial liabilities  and increase in prepaid expenses and contract revenue receivable of million  partially offset by an non cash compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expenses  decrease in other long term assets  increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
cash used in investing activities of million in  consisted primarily of net purchase of marketable securities of million plus the purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million during was due primarily to receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in february and proceeds of million from the exercise of warrants  stock options and the purchase of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
these proceeds were offset by repayments of debt of  and the decrease of bank overdraft of million 
net cash used in operating activities increased from million in to million in and million in the increase in cash used in operating activities from to and from to was due to continued expansion of research and development activities and clinical trial costs 
net cash provided by used in investing activities changed from cash used of million for to cash provided of million in to cash used of million 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities from to is primarily due to sales of short term investments of million 
the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities from to is primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from million in to million in and million in the increase in cash provided by financing activities from to was primarily due to incremental proceeds of million from the issuance of bridge loans  issuances of preferred stock and issuances of equipment loans 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities from to was primarily due to proceeds of million from our initial public offering  and proceeds of million from the exercise of warrants  stock options and the purchase of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
credit facility in february  we entered into an equipment line of credit with ge capital corporation providing funding of up to million 
at december   we had drawn down million on the line of credit 
amounts under the line of credit are secured by the equipment purchased 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to devote substantial resources to continue our research and development efforts and to expand our sales  marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the commercialization and launch of ef decoy and our future products 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds  other than reimbursements and milestone payments that we receive from our collaboration with bms  until we successfully obtain marketing approval for and begin selling ef decoy 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our internal and external sources of cash are our ability to successfully obtain marketing approval for and to commercially launch ef decoy  the success of our other clinical and preclinical development programs  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies  and our ability to maintain our collaboration with bms and enter into other strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations 
if our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net proceeds from our initial public offering  expected reimbursements of development costs and the first regulatory milestone payment from bms payable upon our first us new drug application filing for ef decoy are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we develop or acquire additional product candidates  we may need to raise additional external funds through the sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
contractual obligations our outstanding contractual obligations relate to our equipment debt financings  facilities leases  and obligations under our agreement with our third party contract manufacturer 
our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years four to five years after five years equipment financing operating leases manufacturing development agreement total contractual cash obligations the contractual summary above reflects only payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
we also have contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
we are obligated to make certain payments under our license agreements with the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university and the brigham and women s hospital  inc if milestones relating to the development and regulatory approval of ef decoy are achieved 
in addition  if ef decoy is successfully commercialized we will pay royalties and pursuant to these license agreements 
we are obligated to make annual license  milestone and royalty fee payments under our license agreement with cyclacel for the licensed penetratin endonuclear delivery system 
we are obligated to make certain payments under our agreement with avecia limited upon the achievement of certain manufacturing and product delivery milestones 
upon completion of the manufacturing program  but in no event later than march   we will notify avecia limited of our intention to continue future manufacturing of the products at avecia limited s facility in grangemouth  scotland 
the agreement shall continue until the completion of the manufacturing program and may be terminated by either party at any time prior to completion of the program with days notice 
please see business license agreements and business manufacturing for a further description of these agreements 
on march  we and avecia limited amended our december  agreement for the manufacture of a ef single strand intermediates  b nf kb decoy single strand intermediates and hybridized duplex products  and c hif decoy single strand intermediates 
the amendment extended by one month the period during which avecia would manufacture certain materials for an additional payment by us of million plus reimbursement for raw materials 
the agreement was previously amended on march  to specify the amount of reimbursement to be paid by us for previously used raw materials 
the agreement does not provide for the production of material for commercial sale 
we have also entered into letters of credit totaling  securing our operating lease obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or fas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally limited to our cash equivalents and investments that have maturities of less than two years 
we maintain an investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are therefore subject to interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or percent from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
business risks risks related to our business we will depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidate  ef decoy  which is still in development 
if we are unable to commercialize ef decoy or experience significant delays in doing so  we may have to cease operations 
we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of ef decoy 
we anticipate that in the near term our ability to generate revenues will depend solely on the successful development  approval and commercialization of ef decoy 
if we are not successful in the completion of clinical trials for the development  approval and commercialization of ef decoy  we may never generate any revenues and may be forced to cease operations 
all of our other product candidates are in preclinical development  and we do not expect to seek regulatory approval of these products for many years  if at all 
the commercial success of ef decoy will depend upon successful completion of clinical trials  manufacturing commercial supplies  obtaining marketing approval  successfully launching the product and acceptance of the product by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
the primary and secondary endpoints of our phase clinical trial in pbg failed to show a benefit in the edifoligide treated group compared to the placebo group 
if the data from our phase clinical trail in cabg is not satisfactory  we may not proceed with our planned filing of an application for approval 
our ef decoy consists of a drug and a delivery device  both of which must be approved to commercialize ef decoy 
even if we file an application for approval with satisfactory clinical data  the fda may not accept our filing  or may request additional information  including data from additional clinical trials 
the fda may also approve the device but not the drug or vice versa  may approve ef decoy for very limited purposes with many restrictions on its use  may delay approval  or ultimately  may not grant marketing approval for ef decoy 
even if we do receive the approval of the fda  we may be unable to gain market acceptance by the medical community and third party payors 
if bms terminates our collaboration  or if there are any adverse developments in our relationship with bms  we could be prevented from successfully commercializing ef decoy 
in october  we entered into agreements with bms relating to the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of ef decoy 
based on the terms of our collaboration  we expect to receive significant development funding and milestone payments from bms 
bms may terminate the collaborative agreement upon six months prior notice  after which bms will not be obligated to fund our development and commercialization costs or make milestone payments 
the collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee  consisting of an equal number of representatives of us and bms 
there are also working groups with representation from both parties that have responsibility over development and regulatory  manufacturing  finance and commercialization matters 
ultimate decision making authority is vested in us as to some matters and in bms as to other matters 
a third category of decisions requires the approval of both us and bms 
outside the united states  ultimate decision making authority as to most matters is vested in bms 
any loss of bms as a commercial partner for ef decoy  dispute over the terms of the collaboration  disagreements over decisions made with respect to the collaboration or other adverse developments in our relationship with bms would harm our business and would require us to seek additional capital 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing personnel and expect to depend on third parties to manufacture ef decoy and any future products 
we are dependent on single suppliers for ef decoy intermediates and components of the pressure device used to administer ef decoy 
we have limited personnel with experience in  and we do not own facilities for  manufacturing any clinical or commercial products 
we rely on third parties to supply us with ef decoy and its related device for our clinical trials 
in december  we entered into an agreement with avecia limited for the manufacture of a ef single strand intermediates  b nf kb decoy single strand intermediates and hybridized duplex products  and c hif decoy single strand intermediates 
on march  we and avecia limited amended our december agreement for the manufacture of a ef single strand intermediates  b nf kb decoy single strand intermediates and hybridized duplex products  and c hif decoy single strand intermediates 
the amendment extended by one month the period during which avecia would manufacture certain materials for an additional payment by us of million plus reimbursement for raw materials 
the agreement was previously amended on march  to specify the amount of reimbursement to be paid by us for previously used raw materials 
the agreement does not provide for the production of material for commercial sale 
we do not have agreements with these third parties which obligate them to provide us with any products for future commercial sales 
there are a limited number of manufactures that are capable of manufacturing the active ingredient of ef decoy or its related device and are willing to do so 
if we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain ef decoy and its related device from these suppliers  we may not be able to obtain alternate manufacturers in a timely manner  if at all  to meet our requirements for clinical trials and  subject to receipt of regulatory approvals  commercial sale 
we also depend on third party contract laboratories to perform quality control testing of ef decoy and its device 
in order to produce ef decoy in the quantities that we anticipate will be required to meet anticipated market demand  we need to increase  or scale up  the production process by a significant factor over the current level of production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient 
if we are unable to do so  we may not be able to produce ef decoy in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the launch of the product or to meet future demand 
in addition  if the scaled up production process is not efficient  our gross margins may be reduced 
we may in the future elect to manufacture certain of our products in our own manufacturing facilities 
we would need to invest additional funds and recruit qualified personnel in order to build or lease and operate any manufacturing facilities 
if our third party manufacturers facilities do not follow current good manufacturing practices  our product development and commercialization efforts may be harmed 
there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the fda s and european union s good manufacturing practices regulations and are capable of manufacturing ef decoy 
our third party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages of qualified personnel 
a failure of our third party manufacturers to follow current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study  the termination of  or hold on a clinical study  or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products 
in addition we could be subject to sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions and civil penalties 
changing manufacturers may require revalidation of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with fda mandated current good manufacturing practices and will require fda approval 
this revalidation may be costly and time consuming 
if we are unable to arrange for third party manufacturing of our products  or to do so on commercially reasonable terms  we may not be able to complete development of our products  including ef decoy  or market them 
our competitors currently offer and may develop therapies that reduce the size of our markets 
there are a growing number of approved therapies for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease and end stage renal disease  or esrd 
these include cholesterol lowering agents  agents to prevent or disrupt blood clots  drug eluting stents  balloon angioplasty  arterial bypass grafts and synthetic conduits used for bypass and use of av fistulae to provide vascular access for esrd patients 
some or all of these treatments could reduce the size of the cabg and av graft markets 
these treatments are marketed by major pharmaceutical and or medical device companies 
in particular  drug eluting stents were only approved for use in and could potentially result in a significant decrease in bypass graft procedure volumes 
two drug eluting stents have been approved in the united states and are being marketed by johnson johnson and boston scientific corporation  two companies with significant financial and marketing resources 
in february  guidant corporation and johnson johnson announced a co promotion agreement pursuant to which guidant will co promote johnson johnson s cypher drug eluting stent 
in addition  various other treatments for cardiovascular disease are in various stages of preclinical or clinical testing by other companies 
these therapies could also affect the size of the cabg and or av graft markets or could result in pricing pressure if we receive marketing approval for ef decoy 
if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products by third party payors  there may be no commercially viable markets for our products or the markets may be much smaller than expected 
the availability and levels of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affect the market for our products 
the efficacy  safety and cost effectiveness of our products as well as the efficacy  safety and cost effectiveness of any competing products will determine the availability and level of reimbursement 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare by challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and services 
in certain countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
in these countries  pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries  we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our products  including ef decoy  to other available therapies 
if reimbursement for our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels  our revenues would be reduced 
because ef decoy treatment occurs during bypass graft surgery  and many of these patients are over years of age and likely to be covered by medicare  we will seek to have the level of reimbursement for bypass surgery incorporating ef decoy treatment increased by the centers for medicaid and medicare services  or cms 
cms is the federal agency that administers medicare and makes coverage and reimbursement decisions for medicare beneficiaries 
this is a time consuming and expensive process 
in addition  many private insurers adopt cms coverage and reimbursement decisions for their insureds 
if cms does not increase the level of reimbursement to hospitals associated with ef decoy treatment on a timely basis  or at all  or establishes an unsatisfactory level of reimbursement  ef decoy may never obtain market acceptance or generate meaningful revenues 
the fast track designation for development of ef decoy may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process 
if a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition  the drug sponsor may apply for fda fast track designation 
marketing applications filed by sponsors of products in fast track development may qualify for expedited review under policies or procedures offered by the fda  but the fast track designation does not assure such qualification 
we have been granted fast track designation from the fda for ef decoy for the prevention of bypass graft failure and av graft failure 
ef decoy s fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda if the fda believes that it is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program 
in addition  ef decoy s fast track designation does not guarantee that we will be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that the fda will ultimately approve ef decoy 
if our preclinical tests or clinical trials with respect to our tf decoys for bypass graft failure  av graft failure  inflammatory diseases or cancer do not meet safety or efficacy endpoints in these evaluations  or if we experience significant delays in these tests or trials  our ability to commercialize products and our financial position will be impaired 
clinical development  including preclinical testing  is a long  expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays 
it may take us several years to complete our testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
patient enrollment in future clinical trials and completion of patient follow up in our current phase clinical trial depends on many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the trial protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study and patient compliance 
delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a study may cause an increase in costs and delays  or result in the failure of the trial 
the results of preclinical or clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results  and acceptable results in early studies might not be seen in later studies 
any preclinical or clinical test may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
drug related adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to repeat a trial  terminate a trial or cancel the program 
in addition  we are required by the fda to conduct additional preclinical studies  including toxicology  while our clinical studies are ongoing 
we have a limited operating history and if we do not generate significant revenues  we will not be able to achieve profitability 
we do not have any products approved for marketing 
we have a limited history of operations and have focused primarily on clinical trials of ef decoy 
we have incurred net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial net losses to further develop and commercialize ef decoy and do not know whether or when we will become profitable 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues from ef decoy or attain profitability  we will not be able to sustain our operations 
we will need additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
if we fail to obtain necessary financing or do so on unattractive terms  our development programs and other operations could be harmed 
we will require substantial funds to conduct development  including preclinical testing and clinical trials of our potential products including ef decoy 
we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least mid bms will fund a majority of the ongoing development costs we incur for the development of ef decoy for cabg and av graft failure 
we expect to increase our spending significantly as we expand our infrastructure  development programs and commercialization activities and our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success of our collaboration with bms  the scope and results of our ef decoy clinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for ef decoy  the cost of ef decoy manufacturing activities  the cost of ef decoy commercialization activities  including marketing  sales and distribution  the advancement of our nf kb decoy and cancer decoys into development  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation 
additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research  development or commercial programs 
we could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products which we would otherwise pursue on our own 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution and the terms of any new equity securities may have preference over our common stock 
our products are based on a new technology  tf decoys  and we have only limited experience in regulatory affairs  which may affect our ability or the time required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
all of our product candidates  including ef decoy  are based on our tf decoy technology 
because there are currently no approved products based on this technology  the regulatory requirements governing this type of product may be more rigorous or less clearly established than for already approved classes of therapeutics 
we must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities with preclinical and clinical data that demonstrate that our products are safe and effective before they can be approved for commercial sale 
we  not bms  have primary responsibility for compiling this data and submitting the application for regulatory approval of ef decoy in the united states 
we have only limited experience in filing and prosecuting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals 
as a result  we may experience a longer regulatory process in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates 
if our post approval follow up trial of cabg patients does not show a difference in major cardiac events between treated and untreated patients the fda could withdraw or limit the approval of ef decoy 
if ef decoy is approved by the fda  we will be required by the fda to monitor the cabg patients for up to five years after enrollment to track major cardiac events such as death  heart attack  the need for a repeat cabg surgery or the need for surgical intervention to rescue a failed or failing graft 
even if ef decoy is approved for the prevention of bypass graft failure  the fda may subsequently withdraw or limit such approval if we cannot show a difference in major cardiac events between cabg patients treated with ef decoy and cabg patients receiving a placebo 
if third party clinical research organizations do not perform in an acceptable and timely manner  our clinical trials could be delayed or unsuccessful 
we do not have the ability to conduct all of our clinical trials independently 
we rely on clinical investigators  third party clinical research organizations and consultants to perform substantially all of these functions 
if we cannot locate acceptable contractors to run our clinical trials or enter into favorable agreements with them  or if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties  satisfy fda requirements for the conduct of clinical trials or meet expected deadlines  we will be unable to obtain required approvals and will be unable to commercialize our products  including ef decoy  on a timely basis  if at all 
our agreements are generally cancelable by either party with to days agreement  with or without cause 
we may fail to obtain fda clearance or approval of the pressure device used to deliver ef decoy 
we will need to obtain clearance of the pressure device used to deliver the drug by the fda s center for devices and radiological health  or cdrh  under a k pre market notification establishing that the pressure device is substantially equivalent to one or more marketed predicate devices 
we expect to file such notification in the first quarter of in the event we cannot establish such substantial equivalence  we will need to request that the fda classify the pressure device as a class i or class ii device that can be marketed without pre market approval or  failing that  obtain pre market approval of the pressure device by cdrh 
the fda classifies medical devices into three classes based on the regulatory control deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably ensure safety and effectiveness 
a class i device is subject to general controls  including compliance with the fda s good manufacturing practices regulations and labeling regulations 
a class ii device is subject to general controls and special controls  which may include special labeling requirements  mandatory performance standards and post market surveillance 
a class iii device is subject to pre market approval requiring the independent demonstration that the new medical device is safe and effective 
if we are unable to obtain clearance or approval of the pressure device  the commercialization of ef decoy could be delayed or possibly prevented 
even if our products are approved by regulatory authorities  if we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market 
any product for which we obtain marketing approval  along with the manufacturing processes  post approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product  will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products  including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  manufacturer or manufacturing processes  or failure to comply with regulatory requirements  may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of the products from the market  voluntary or mandatory recall  fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product seizures  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad 
we intend to market our products in international markets 
in order to market our products in the european union and many other foreign jurisdictions  we must obtain separate regulatory approvals 
in the case of ef decoy  we have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities  and bms has responsibility to obtain regulatory approvals outside the united states 
we will be dependent on bms to obtain these approvals 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda 
we may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market 
if we do not find collaborators for our other product candidates  we may have to reduce or delay our rate of product development and or increase our expenditures 
our strategy to develop  manufacture and commercialize our products includes entering into various relationships with pharmaceutical companies with respect to some programs to advance such programs and reduce our expenditures on such programs 
to date  we have entered into one collaboration agreement regarding ef decoy 
our other product candidates will target highly competitive therapeutic markets in which we have limited experience and expertise 
if we are unable to develop this expertise ourselves  we will need to enter into agreements with a larger biotechnology or pharmaceutical company to provide us with the necessary resources and experience for the development and commercialization of products in these markets 
there are a limited number of companies with the resources necessary to develop our future products commercially  and we may be unable to attract any of these firms 
a company that has entered into a collaboration agreement with one of our competitors may choose not to enter into a collaboration agreement with us 
we may not be able to negotiate any collaboration on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are not able to establish collaborative arrangements  we may have to reduce or delay further development of some of our programs and or increase our expenditures and undertake the development activities at our own expense 
if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund our development programs  we will need to obtain additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have reduced the number of potential future collaborators 
if business combinations involving bms or other potential collaborators were to occur  the effect could be to diminish  terminate or cause delays in one or more of our product development programs 
we depend on our officers and key employees  and if we are not able to retain them or recruit additional qualified personnel  our business will suffer 
we are highly dependent on our president and chief executive officer  john p 
mclaughlin and other officers and key employees 
due to the specialized knowledge each of our officers and key employees possesses with respect to ef decoy and our operations  the loss of service of any of our officers or key employees could delay or prevent the successful completion of our phase clinical trials or the commercialization of ef decoy 
we do not carry key man life insurance on our officers or key employees except for mr 
mclaughlin 
we have employment agreements with mr 
mclaughlin  richard p 
powers  our vice president and chief financial officer  todd j 
lorenz  our chief medical officer  leslie m 
mcevoy  our senior vice president  research  james z 
huang  our senior vice president  commercial operations and business development  and patrick broderick  our vice president and general counsel 
each of our officers and key employees may terminate their employment without notice and without cause or good reason 
we currently are not aware that any officer or key employee is planning to leave or retire 
in addition  our growth will require hiring a significant number of qualified scientific  commercial and administrative personnel 
accordingly  recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success 
there is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities 
our offices are located in the san francisco bay area  where competition for personnel with biopharmaceutical skills is intense 
if we fail to identify  attract  retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel  we may be unable to continue our development and commercialization activities 
if we are unable to manage any necessary growth  we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates  including ef decoy 
we expanded our workforce  located in both california and pennsylvania from full time employees on december  to full time employees on december  to commercialize ef decoy  we will be required to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls and expand  train and manage our employee base 
there can be no assurance that our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support such growth 
if we are unable to manage any necessary growth effectively  our business could be harmed 
risks related to our industry we face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance 
our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the testing  manufacturing  and marketing of drugs and related devices 
although we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is appropriate  this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate protection against potential liabilities 
in addition  if any of our product candidates are approved for marketing  we may seek additional insurance coverage 
if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we will be exposed to significant liabilities  which may harm our business 
these liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
defending a suit  regardless of merit  could be costly  could divert management attention and might result in adverse publicity or reduced acceptance of our products in the market 
our operations involve hazardous materials and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations relating to the use  handling  storage and disposal of these materials 
we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of such substances and store certain low level radioactive waste at our facility until the materials are no longer considered radioactive 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
we may be required to incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental and safety regulations 
if an accident or contamination occurred  we would likely incur significant costs associated with civil penalties or criminal fines and in complying with environmental laws and regulations 
we do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from hazardous materials 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive  and current or future environmental regulation may impair our research  development or production efforts 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological change 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  as well as specialized biotechnology and life sciences firms in the united states and in other countries 
most of these companies have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors 
our existing or prospective competitors may develop processes or products that are more effective than ours or be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products faster 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and or receiving regulatory approval for commercializing products before us 
developments by our competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive 
we also experience competition from universities and other research institutions  and we frequently compete with others in acquiring technology from those sources 
these industries have undergone  and are expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change  and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies with significant advantages over those that we are seeking to develop 
any such development could harm our business 
legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
in both the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact upon our ability to sell our products profitably 
in the united states in recent years  new legislation has been proposed at the federal and state levels that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
these proposals have included prescription drug benefit proposals for medicare beneficiaries introduced in congress 
legislation creating a prescription drug benefit and making certain changes in medicare reimbursement has recently been enacted by congress 
given this legislation s recent enactment  it is still too early to determine its impact on the pharmaceutical industry and our business 
further federal and state proposals are likely 
more recently  administrative proposals are pending that would change the method for calculating the reimbursement of certain drugs 
the potential for adoption of these proposals may affect our ability to raise capital  obtain additional collaborators or market our products 
such proposals  if enacted  may reduce our revenues  increase our expenses or limit the markets for our products 
in particular  we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property incorporated into our products  the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected 
our success will depend in large part on our ability or the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain protection in the united states and other countries for the intellectual property incorporated into our products 
as of december   we had issued united states and foreign patents and pending united states and foreign patent applications 
the patent situation in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions 
neither we nor our licensors may be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology 
even if issued  patents may be challenged  narrowed  invalidated  or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of the term of patent protection we may have for our products 
in addition  our patents and our licensors patents may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until months after filing  or in some cases not at all  and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications  or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
any leak of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets 
if we lose our licenses from stanford university or the brigham and women s hospital we will not be able to continue our business 
we hold licenses from the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university and the brigham and women s hospital  inc for patents  patent applications and know how covering our technology generally and ef decoy specifically 
these license agreements impose various diligence  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  insurance  and other obligations on us 
if we fail to comply with the obligations in the license agreements  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license and we may not be able to market products that were covered by the license including ef decoy 
to date  we have met all of our obligations under these agreements 
we may incur substantial costs enforcing our patents  defending against third party patents  invalidating third party patents or licensing third party intellectual property  as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may not have rights under some patents or patent applications that would be infringed by technologies that we use in our research  drug targets that we select  or product candidates that we seek to develop and commercialize 
third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad 
these third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators  we or they could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit 
we or our collaborators therefore may choose to seek  or be required to seek  a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or forced to cease some aspect of our business operations  as a result of patent infringement claims  which could harm our business 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
although we are not currently a party to any patent litigation or any other adversarial proceeding  including any interference proceeding declared before the united states patent and trademark office  regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology  we may become so in the future 
we are not currently aware of any actual or potential infringement claim involving our intellectual property rights 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
the outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance  including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party  especially in biotechnology related patent cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
if a patent or other proceeding is resolved against us  we may be enjoined from researching  developing  manufacturing or commercializing our products without a license from the other party and we may be held liable for significant damages 
we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
we may not be successful in our efforts to expand our portfolio of products and develop additional delivery technologies 
a key element of our strategy is to discover  develop and commercialize a portfolio of new drugs in addition to ef decoy  and technologies to deliver those drugs safely and efficiently 
we are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and in licensing 
a significant portion of the research that we are conducting involves new and unproven technologies 
research programs to identify new disease targets  product candidates and delivery technologies require substantial technical  financial and human resources whether or not any candidates or technologies are ultimately identified 
our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates or delivery technologies  yet fail to yield product candidates or delivery technologies for clinical development for any of the following reasons research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates  potential delivery technologies may not safely or efficiently deliver our drugs  and product candidates may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to be effective drugs 
if we are unable to discover suitable potential product candidates or develop additional delivery technologies through internal research programs or in license suitable products or delivery technologies on acceptable business terms  our business prospects will suffer 
other risks changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies 
accounting methods and policies for biopharmaceutical companies  including policies governing revenue recognition  expenses  accounting for stock options and in process research and development costs are subject to further review  interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities  including the securities and exchange commission 
changes to  or interpretations of  accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify  restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements  including those contained in this annual report on form k 
historically  we have not been required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee s stock option exercise price equals or exceeds the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
the financial accounting standards board issued in december statement of accounting standards no 
revised which will require us to record expense for the fair value of stock options granted and purchases under employee stock purchase plans beginning june  when we change our accounting policy to record expense for the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased  our operating expenses will increase 
we rely heavily on stock options to motivate existing employees and attract new employees 
when we are required to expense stock options  we may choose to reduce our reliance on stock options as a motivation tool 
if we reduce our use of stock options  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we do not reduce our reliance on stock options  our reported losses will increase 
anti takeover defenses that we have in place could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the company 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of delaware law may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors  so that not all members of our board may be elected at one time  set limitations on the removal of directors  limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders  establish advance agreement requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and provide our board of directors the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirors at a premium over prevailing prices 
this potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence 
our a executive officers and b directors and principal stockholders  together with their affiliates  as of december  beneficially owned approximately percent and percent of our voting stock  respectively  including shares subject to outstanding options 
our executive officers are not affiliated with any of our directors  principal stockholders or their affiliates 
these stockholders will likely be able to determine the composition of our board of directors  possess the voting power to approve all matters requiring stockholder approval  and continue to have significant influence over our operations 
the interests of these stockholders may be different than the interests of other stockholders on these matters 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock 
if our stock price is volatile  purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
our stock price is likely to be volatile 
the stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including results of our clinical trials  failure of any of our product candidates  if approved  to achieve commercial success  developments concerning our collaboration with bms  regulatory developments in the united states and foreign countries  developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights  ability to manufacture our products to commercial standards  public concern over our products  litigation  the departure of key personnel  future sales of our common stock  variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us  changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems  investors perceptions of us  and general economic  industry and market conditions
