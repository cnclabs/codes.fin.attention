item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in light of these and other uncertainties  you should not conclude that we will necessarily achieve any plans or objectives or projected financial results referred to in any forward looking statements 
item business 
we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect products as well as service  maintain  repair and upgrade equipment  all used to assemble and or test semiconductor devices 
we are currently the world s leading supplier of semiconductor wire bonding assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is currently divided into three product segments equipment  packaging materials  and wafer and package test interconnect products 
we completed the divestiture of our former advanced packaging technologies segment in february our goal is to be both the technology leader and the lowest cost supplier in each of our major lines of business 
we believe we are the only major supplier to the semiconductor assembly industry that provides customers with semiconductor wire bonding equipment along with the complementary packaging materials and test interconnect products that actually contact the surface of the customer s semiconductor devices 
we believe that the ability to control all of these assembly related products provides us with a significant competitive advantage  and should allow us to develop system solutions to the new technology challenges inherent in assembling and packaging next generation semiconductor devices 
the semiconductor industry has been historically volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by downturns 
in response to recent downturns  we shifted our strategy  focusing on our larger  more established product lines  and divesting or discontinuing smaller or more speculative businesses 
additionally  we continuously seek to further reduce our cost structure by moving operations to lower cost areas  moving away from non core businesses  and increasing our productivity 
we believe the historical volatility of the semiconductor industry both upward and downward will persist

products and services we offer a range of wire bonding equipment and spare parts  packaging materials  and test interconnect products 
set forth below is a table listing the net revenue from continuing operations for each business segment for our fiscal years ended september    and in thousands fiscal year ended september  equipment packaging materials test interconnect other in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the assets related to the saw and hard material blade businesses that were part of the equipment segment and packaging materials segment  respectively 
those businesses together had fiscal net sales of million 
comprised of sales associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal our equipment sales are highly volatile  based on the semiconductor industry s need for new capability and capacity  whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales in general tend to be more stable  following the trend of total semiconductor unit production 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  included under item of this report  for financial results by business segment and sales by geographic location 
equipment we manufacture and market a line of wire bonders  which are used to connect very fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or copper  between the bond pads of a semiconductor die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been attached 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages by providing customers with high productivity throughput and superior package quality process control 
in particular  our machines are capable of performing very fine pitch bonding as well as creating the sophisticated wire loop shapes that are needed in the assembly of advanced semiconductor packages 
our principal products are ball bonders 
automatic ic ball bonders represent a large majority of our semiconductor equipment business 
as part of our competitive strategy  we have been introducing new models of ic ball bonders every to months  with each new model designed to increase both productivity and process capability compared to its predecessor 
in  we extended the life of the successful maxum product line introducing the maxum ultra to supersede the maxum plus and the maxum elite to supersede the nutek 
each of these machines provides approximately a productivity improvement over its predecessor and offers various other performance improvements 
specialty wire bonders 
we also produce other models of wire bonders  targeted at specific market niches  including the model  a large area ball bonder designed for wire bonding hybrid  chip on board  and other large area applications  and the model  a large area wedge bonder 
we introduced a new model wafer stud bumper during the fourth quarter 
table of contents of this year  the at premier 
the at premier is targeted for gold to gold interconnect in the growing flip chip market 
with industry leading speed and technology  the machine lowers the cost of ownership for stud bumping  enabling a wider range of applications than previously served 
we also manufacture and market a line of manual wire bonders 
we believe that our industry knowledge and technical experience have positioned us to deliver innovative  customer specific offerings that reduce the cost of owning our equipment over its useful life 
in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we provide repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through our customer operations group 
packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of semiconductor packaging materials and expendable tools for the semiconductor assembly market  including gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in packaging and assembly processes 
our packaging materials are designed for use on both our own and our competitors assembly equipment 
a wire bonder uses a capillary or wedge tool and bonding wire much like a sewing machine uses a needle and thread 
our principal products are bonding wire 
we manufacture gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
this wire is bonded to the chip surface and package substrate by the wire bonder and becomes a permanent part of the customer s semiconductor package 
we produce wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications across the spectrum of semiconductor packages 
expendable tools 
our expendable tools include a wide variety of capillaries  wedges  die collets and wafer saw blades 
the capillaries and wedges attach the wire to the semiconductor chip  allow a precise amount of wire to be fed out to form a permanent wire loop  then attach the wire to the package substrate  and finally cut the wire so that the bonding process can be repeated again 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages before the wire bonding process begins 
our hub blades are used to cut silicon wafers into individual semiconductor die 
test interconnect we offer a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily contact a semiconductor device while it is still in the wafer format wafer probing  thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
we also offer test sockets used to test the final semiconductor package package or final testing 
our principal test interconnect products are probe cards 
probe cards consist of complex  multilayer printed circuit boards pcb upon which are attached numerous probe needles designed to make temporary contact to each of the bond pads or bumps on a die while the die is still in a wafer format  providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies 
ate interface assemblies typically consist of electro mechanical assemblies  electrical contactors and intricate multilayer pcbs  which mechanically and electrically connect to the ate test prober and carry electrical signals to a probe card  and ultimately the semiconductor device under test 
test sockets 
test sockets hold packaged semiconductor devices while making electrical connections to their leads through spring loaded contacts 
changes in the design of a semiconductor device often require changes in the probe card  test socket and  in certain cases  the ate interface assembly used to test that semiconductor 
customers generally purchase new versions of these custom designed products each time there is a design change in the semiconductor being tested 
changes in semiconductor design and processes drive improvements in test interconnect technology in order to support significant increases in the number and density of bond pads or leads being tested and the speed of the electrical signals being tested 

table of contents customers our major customers include large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
customers may vary from year to year based on their capital investment and operating expense budgets 
the chart below shows our top ten end use customers  based on net sales  for each of the last three fiscal years fiscal fiscal fiscal advanced semiconductor engineering advanced semiconductor engineering advanced semiconductor engineering st microelectronics st microelectronics st microelectronics intel texas instruments intel amkor technologies intel siliconware precision industries texas instruments siliconware precision industries infineon technologies infineon technologies spansion texas instruments national semiconductor national semiconductor stats chippac philips electronics st assembly test samsung st assembly test infineon technologies spansion siliconware precision industries amkor technologies national semiconductor accounted for more than of total fiscal year net sales 
we believe that developing long term relationships with our customers is critical to our success 
by establishing these relationships with semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor subcontract assemblers  and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  we gain insight into our customers future ic packaging strategies 
this insight assists us in our efforts to develop material  equipment and process solutions that address our customers future assembly requirements 
international operations we sell our products to semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor subcontract assemblers  and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  which are primarily located in or have operations in the asia pacific region 
approximately of our fiscal net sales  of our fiscal net sales  and of our fiscal net sales were for delivery to customer locations outside of the united states 
the majority of these foreign sales were destined for customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea  japan  china and the philippines 
we expect sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a majority of our future revenues 
sales and customer support we believe that providing comprehensive worldwide sales  service  training and support are important competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment industry  and we manage these functions through our global customer operations group 
some of these operations are focused on wire bonders and packaging materials  and others focus on test related products 
we rely on a combination of a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and distributors for the sale of our various product lines 
in order to support our customers whose semiconductor assembly operations are located primarily outside of the united states  we have sales  service  and support personnel based in china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan  thailand  and europe  and applications labs in singapore  japan  israel  and taiwan 
we provide timely customer service and support by positioning our service representatives and spare parts near customer facilities  which provides customers with the ability to place orders locally and to deal with service and support personnel who speak the customer s language and are familiar with local country practices 

table of contents backlog at september   we had a backlog of customer orders totaling million  compared to million at june  and million at september  our backlog consists of customer orders which are scheduled for shipment within months 
virtually all orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of revenues for any succeeding quarterly period 
manufacturing the company believes excellence in manufacturing can create a competitive advantage  both through lower costs and superior responsiveness 
in order to achieve these goals  we manage our manufacturing operations through a single organization and are trending to fewer  larger factories to take advantage of economies of scale and the cost savings available in low labor cost areas 
equipment 
our equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of integrating outsourced parts and subassemblies  and testing the finished product to customer specifications 
during fiscal  most of our equipment manufacturing took place in singapore  with a small number of machines built in willow grove  pennsylvania 
we believe the outsourcing model enables us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures and focus on product differentiation through technology innovations in system design and manufacturing quality control 
just in time inventory management has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and reduced our on hand inventory requirements 
we have received iso and iso certifications for our equipment manufacturing facility in singapore 
packaging materials 
we manufacture expendable tools at facilities in yokneam  israel and suzhou  china  and bonding wire at facilities in singapore and thalwil  switzerland 
we manufacture blades for wafer sawing in santa clara  california  scheduled to be closed in the first quarter of fiscal and suzhou  china 
our bonding wire facility in switzerland has received iso certification  our bonding wire facility in singapore has received qs and iso certifications  our blade facility in california has received iso certification  our bonding tools facility in yokneam  israel has received iso and iso certifications  and our bonding tools facility in suzhou  china has received iso and iso certifications 
test interconnect products 
we manufacture test probe cards in various facilities located in gilbert  arizona  san jose  california  hsin chu  taiwan  suzhou  china  and corbeil  france 
we manufacture ate interface assemblies in gilbert  arizona 
as part of our ongoing cost reduction activities  we sold our ate test board fabrication assets in dallas  texas in the third quarter of fiscal and moved to an outsource strategy for these components 
in fiscal  we closed a test manufacturing facility in meyreuil  france 
during  we closed test manufacturing facilities in east kilbride  scotland  hayward  california and in singapore 
research and product development many of our customers generate technology roadmaps describing the future manufacturing capability requirements needed to support their product development plans 
our research and product development activities are organized so that our products anticipate our customers requirements 
this can happen either through continuous improvement of our existing products  including upgrades for products already installed in customers facilities  or through the creation of next generation products 
examples of our continuous improvement strategy include the maxum elite and maxum ultra wire bonders both improvements of the maxum product line  our advanced epoxy line of probe cards  and our duracap line of bonding tools 
major next generation development programs are underway for our wire bonder  probe card and test socket product lines 
whether we proceed via continuous improvement  or via next generation technology development  our goal is technology leadership in each of our major product lines 
our net expenditures for research and development totaled approximately million  million  and million during our fiscal years ended september   and  respectively

some of our competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers because many of these customers appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
intellectual property where circumstances warrant  we seek to obtain patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research  engineering and manufacturing activities 
we currently hold a number of united states patents  some of which have foreign counterparts 
we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents 
we believe that our portfolio of patents will have more value in the future but that our success will depend primarily on our engineering  manufacturing  marketing and service skills 
in addition  we believe that much of our important technology resides in our trade secrets and proprietary software 
as long as we rely on trade secrets and unpatented knowledge  including software  to maintain our competitive position  we cannot assure you that competitors may not independently develop similar technologies and possibly obtain patents containing claims applicable to our products and processes 
our ability to defend ourselves against these claims may be limited 
in addition  although we execute non disclosure and non competition agreements with certain of our employees  customers  consultants  selected vendors and others  there is no assurance that such secrecy agreements will not be breached  or that they can be enforced 
additional disclosures regarding these risks  as well as other risk factors facing the company are included in item management s discussion and analysis  included herein 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees 
in addition  we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third party waste disposal sites we use or have used 
these laws could impose liability upon us even if we did not know of  or were not responsible for  the contamination 

table of contents we have in the past and will in the future incur costs to comply with environmental laws 
we are not  however  currently aware of any costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters  including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third party waste disposal sites  that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
it is possible  however  that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future 
employees at september   we had  permanent employees and temporary and contract workers worldwide 
the only employees represented by a labor union are the bonding wire employees in singapore 
generally  we believe our employee relations to be good 
competition in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry is intense  particularly with respect to engineering 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees

introduction we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect products as well as service  maintain  repair and upgrade equipment  all used to assemble or test semiconductor devices 
we are currently the world s leading supplier of semiconductor wire bonding assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is currently divided into three product segments equipment  packaging materials  and wafer and package test interconnect products we believe we are the only major supplier to the semiconductor assembly industry that provides customers with semiconductor wire bonding equipment along with the complementary packaging materials and test interconnect products that actually contact the surface of the customer s semiconductor devices 
we believe that the ability to control all of these assembly related products provides us with a significant competitive advantage and should allow us to develop system solutions to the new technology challenges inherent in assembling and packaging next generation semiconductor devices 
the semiconductor industry historically has been volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by downturns 
one such downturn began during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as we experienced a reduction in sales compared to our third quarter of fiscal the sales decline continued into the first quarter of fiscal as sales were down compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents revenue increased during the second quarter of fiscal  compared to the first quarter of fiscal  and increased during the third quarter of fiscal  compared to the second fiscal quarter of in addition  revenues increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter of fiscal we expect this trend to continue into the december quarter  with revenues in the to million range 
there can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products  and in any case  we believe the historical volatility both upward and downward will persist 
we have continued to lower our cost structure by consolidating operations  moving certain of our manufacturing capacity to china  moving a portion of our supply chain to lower cost suppliers and designing higher performing  lower cost equipment 
cost reduction efforts have become  and will continue to be  an important part of our normal ongoing operations and we believe this will drive down our cost structure below current levels  while not diminishing our product quality 
we expect to incur additional expenses such as severance and facility closing costs as a result of these cost reduction programs 
our goal is to be both the technology leader and the lowest cost supplier in each of our major lines of business 
we reported a loss from operations from our test business segment of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal loss includes non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling million 
we are continuing with our plan to improve the performance of this segment 
to date  we have made progress on consolidating some of our test facilities and transferring portions of our test production to our china facility  and we are continuing to aggressively market our existing products to customers 
at the same time  we continue to work on the development of our new test products  including our quatrix and advanced vertical test avt programs 
we expect these test plan activities will continue through calendar year and will result in future period charges and or restructuring charges  which may be significant 
products and services we offer a range of wire bonding equipment and spare parts  packaging materials and test interconnect products 
set forth below is a table listing the percentage of our total net revenues from continuing operations for each business segment dollars in thousands fiscal year ended september  net revenues of total net revenues net revenues of total net revenues net revenues of total net revenues equipment packaging materials test interconnect other in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the assets related to the saw and hard material blade businesses that were part of the equipment segment and packaging materials segment  respectively 
those businesses had fiscal net sales of million 
comprised of sales associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal our equipment sales have been  and are expected to remain  highly volatile due to the semiconductor industry s need for new capability and capacity  whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales tend to be more stable  following the trend of total semiconductor unit production 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial results by business segment 
equipment we manufacture and market a line of wire bonders  which are used to connect very fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or 
table of contents copper  between the bond pads of a semiconductor die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been attached 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages by providing customers with high productivity throughput and superior package quality process control 
in particular  our machines are capable of performing very fine pitch bonding as well as creating the sophisticated wire loop shapes that are needed in the assembly of advanced semiconductor packages 
our principal products are ball bonders 
automatic ic ball bonders represent a large majority of our semiconductor equipment business 
as part of our competitive strategy  we have been introducing new models of ic ball bonders every to months  with each new model designed to increase both productivity and process capability compared to its predecessor 
in  we extended the life of the successful maxum product line  introducing the maxum ultra to supersede the maxum plus and the maxum elite to supersede the nu tek 
each of these machines provides approximately a productivity improvement over its predecessor and offers various other performance improvements 
specialty wire bonders 
we also produce other models of wire bonders  targeted at specific market niches  including the model  a large area ball bonder designed for wire bonding hybrid  chip on board  and other large area applications  and the model  a large area wedge bonder 
we introduced a new model wafer stud bumper during the fourth quarter of this year  the at premier 
the at premier is targeted for gold to gold interconnect in the growing flip chip market 
with industry leading speed and technology  the machine lowers the cost of ownership for stud bumping  enabling a wider range of applications than previously served 
we also manufacture and market a line of manual wire bonders 
we believe that our industry knowledge and technical experience have positioned us to deliver innovative  customer specific offerings that reduce the cost of owning our equipment over its useful life 
in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we provide repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through our customer operations group 
packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of semiconductor packaging materials and expendable tools for the semiconductor assembly market  including gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in packaging and assembly processes 
our packaging materials are designed for use on both our own and our competitors assembly equipment 
a wire bonder uses a capillary or wedge tool and bonding wire much like a sewing machine uses a needle and thread 
our principal products are bonding wire 
we manufacture gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
this wire is bonded to the chip surface and package substrate by the wire bonder and becomes a permanent part of the customer s semiconductor package 
we produce wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications across the spectrum of semiconductor packages 
expendable tools 
our expendable tools include a wide variety of capillaries  wedges  die collets and wafer saw blades 
the capillaries and wedges actually attach the wire to the semiconductor chip  allow a precise amount of wire to be fed out to form a permanent wire loop  then attach the wire to the package substrate  and finally cut the wire so that the bonding process can be repeated again 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages before the wire bonding process begins 
our hub blades are used to cut silicon wafers into individual semiconductor die 
test interconnect we offer a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily contact a semiconductor device while it is still in the wafer format wafer probing  thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
we also offer test sockets used to test the final semiconductor package package or final testing 
our principal test interconnect products are probe cards 
probe cards consist of complex  multilayer printed circuit boards pcb upon which are attached numerous probe needles designed to make temporary contact to each of the bond pads or bumps on a die while the die is still in a wafer format  providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 

table of contents automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies 
ate interface assemblies typically consist of electro mechanical assemblies  electrical contactors and intricate multilayer pcbs  which mechanically and electrically connect to the ate test prober and carry electrical signals to a probe card  and ultimately the semiconductor device under test 
test sockets 
test sockets hold packaged semiconductor devices while making electrical connections to their leads through spring loaded contacts 
changes in the design of a semiconductor device often require changes in the probe card  test socket and  in certain cases  the ate interface assembly used to test that semiconductor 
customers generally purchase new versions of these custom designed products each time there is a design change in the semiconductor being tested 
changes in semiconductor design and processes drive improvements in test interconnect technology in order to support significant increases in the number and density of bond pads or leads being tested and the speed of the electrical signals being tested 
accounting policies  pronouncements and estimates we believe the following accounting policy is critical to the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  the collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have satisfied equipment installation obligations and received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue based upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
our standard terms are ex works k s factory  with title transferring to our customer at our loading dock or upon embarkation 
we do have a small percentage of sales with other terms  and revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the related customer purchase order 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a prorated straight line basis over the term of the contract 
revenue from royalty arrangements and license agreements is recognized in accordance with the contract terms  generally prorated over the life of the contract or based upon specific deliverables 
our business is subject to contingencies related to customer orders as follows right of return a large portion of our revenue comes from the sale of machines that are used in the semiconductor assembly process 
these items are generally built to order  and often include customization to a customer s specifications 
other product sales relate to consumable products  which are sold in high volume quantities  and are generally maintained at low stock levels at our customer s facility 
as a result  customer returns have historically represented a very small percentage of customer sales on an annual basis 
our policy is to provide an allowance for customer returns based upon our historical experience and management assumptions 
warranties our products are generally shipped with a one year warranty against manufacturer s defects and we generally do not offer extended warranties in the normal course of our business 
we recognize a liability for estimated warranty expense when revenue for the related product is recognized 
the estimated liability for warranty is based upon historical experience and our estimates of future expenses 
conditions of acceptance sales of our consumable products and bonding wire generally do not have customer acceptance terms 
in certain cases  sales of our equipment products do have customer acceptance clauses which generally require that the equipment perform in accordance with specifications during an on site factory inspection by the customer  as well as when installed at the customer s facility 
in such cases  if the terms of acceptance are satisfied at our facility prior to 
table of contents shipment  the revenue for the equipment will be recognized upon shipment 
if the terms of acceptance are satisfied at our customer s facility  the revenue for the equipment will be not be recognized until acceptance  which typically consists of installation and testing  is received from the customer 
price protection we do not provide price protection to our customers 
critical estimates and assumptions generally accepted accounting principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas involving the use of estimates in our financial statements include allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  carrying value and lives of fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  repatriation of unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings  self insurance reserves  pension benefit liabilities  resizing  warranties  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we are also subject to concentrations of customers and sales to a few geographic locations  which would also impact the collectability of certain receivables 
if economic or political conditions were to change in some of the countries where we do business  it could have a significant impact on the results of our operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivable 
inventory reserves 
we generally provide reserves for obsolete inventory and for inventory considered to be in excess of or months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and a review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to our suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
if required  we record additional reserves for the difference between the carrying value of our inventory and the lower of cost or market value  based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the next cyclical market upturn 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory reserves may be required 
we review and physically dispose of excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  and goodwill and intangible assets 
our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets is based upon our estimates of future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we manage and value our intangible technology assets in the aggregate  as one asset group  not by individual technology 
we perform our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with our annual planning process 
we also test for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs 
our impairment testing resulted in an impairment charge related to our test segment business of million in fiscal  an impairment charge of million in fiscal related to our pc board fabrication business  and an impairment charge of million in fiscal million was included in continuing operations and million was included in discontinued operations related to actions taken within our test business segment 
the fiscal impairment charge included million related to our flip chip business unit  million related to manufacturing equipment for a discontinued test product  million related to manufacturing equipment in our dallas  texas test facility and million related to write downs of assets sold and write offs of obsolete assets 
if our actual results are less favorable than the estimates or assumptions used to determine the fair value of the respective assets  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in accordance with sfas and sfas 
table of contents deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and our ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
in fiscal and we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets generated from our us net operating losses 
in fiscal we reversed the portion of the valuation allowance that was equal to the us federal income tax expense on our us income for that fiscal year 
in fiscal  we generated additional us net operating loss carryforwards and established additional valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets 
also in fiscal  we reduced the valuation allowance against us net operating loss carryfowards for the planned repatriation of certain foreign earnings in fiscal if we were to generate additional us net operating loss carryforwards  additional valuation allowances would be set up against these deferred tax assets 
resizing 
we have engaged and may continue to engage in resizing activities in response to the semiconductor industry s volatility 
our resizing plans require us to make significant estimates in several areas including the realizable values of assets  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  and costs for lease terminations 
the amounts we have accrued represent our estimates of the obligations we ultimately expect to incur in connection with our resizing plans  but could be subject to change due to various factors  including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties 
any additional resizing actions may have an negative effect on our operating results in the period in which any such action is taken 
overview of statement of operations net revenues 
our equipment sales depend on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide  which in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and technology driven advancements in semiconductor design 
our packaging materials sales depend on manufacturing expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide  many of which also purchase our equipment products 
however  the volatility in demand for our packaging materials is less than that of our equipment sales due to the consumable nature of these products 
to a lesser extent  our gold wire sales are impacted by changes in the price of gold 
our test interconnect solutions sales depend on the manufacturing expenditures of some of the same semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors as our equipment and packaging materials sales  as well as other customers 
because of the consumable and customized nature of most of our test products  however  the volatility in demand for these test products is less than that of our equipment sales 
cost of goods sold 
equipment cost of goods sold consists mainly of subassemblies  materials  direct and indirect labor costs and other overhead 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we rely on sole source suppliers for some material components 
packaging materials cost of goods sold consists primarily of gold and aluminum  direct labor and other materials used in the manufacture of bonding wire  capillaries  wedges and other company products  with gold making up the majority of the cost 
gold bonding wire is generally priced based on a fabrication charge per  feet of wire  plus the value of the gold 
to minimize our exposure to gold price fluctuations  we obtain gold for fabrication under a contract with our gold supplier  which generally matches the price we pay for the gold with the price we invoice our customers 
accordingly  fluctuations in the price of gold are generally absorbed by our gold supplier or passed on to our customers 
since gold makes up a significant portion of the cost of goods sold of our bonding wire business unit  the gross profit as a percentage of sales of that business unit and therefore of the packaging materials segment is lower than can be expected in the equipment business 
test interconnect cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor and indirect labor for engineering design and materials used in the manufacture of wafer and ic package testing cards and devices 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense is comprised primarily of personnel and related costs  professional fees  and depreciation expense 
research and development expense 
our research and development costs consist primarily of labor  prototype material and other costs associated with our development efforts to strengthen our product lines and develop new products and depreciation expense 
included in research and development expense is the cost to develop the software that operates our semiconductor assembly equipment  which is expensed as incurred 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs

during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal a booking is recorded when a customer order is reviewed and a determination is made that all specifications can be met  production or service can be scheduled  a delivery date can be set  and the customer meets the company s credit requirements 
at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
net revenues business segment net revenues dollar amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  change equipment packaging materials test interconnect 
table of contents net revenue 
overall  net revenue for fiscal decreased million  or to million from million in fiscal following is a review of net revenue for each of our three business segments 
for fiscal  net revenue for the equipment segment declined million  or to million from million in fiscal this decrease in revenue was primarily due to a reduction in unit sales of our automatic ball bonders caused by reduced industry wide demand for backend semiconductor equipment 
partially offsetting this decrease in unit sales was a increase in average selling prices  resulting from higher average selling prices on our next generation automatic ball bonders 
generally  the proportion of newer models sold  as well as product and customer mix  impact average selling prices 
for fiscal  net revenue for the packaging materials segment increased million  or to million from million in fiscal this increase in revenue resulted from a million increase in wire revenue that was partially offset by a million reduction in expendable tools revenue 
the million increase in wire revenue was primarily due to a increase in gold wire unit volumes caused by increased orders from existing customers and two new customers in taiwan  along with a increase in average selling prices caused by an increase in the price of gold 
the million reduction in expendable tools revenue was primarily due to an reduction in average selling prices caused by pricing pressures  and a reduction in capillary unit sales caused by lower industry wide demand 
gold wire selling prices are heavily dependent upon the price of gold and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
for fiscal  our test segment net revenue decreased million  or to million from million in fiscal the lower net revenues were primarily due to reduced industry wide demand  reduced market share caused by factory closings and operations transfers  product pricing pressures  and lower demand for our products from our customers 
blended average selling prices are not meaningful in the test business due to lack of a standard unit of measure and the large difference in types sold 
as such  blended average selling price is not a metric used by management the majority of our sales are to customers that are located outside of the united states or that have manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised of our total sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of these foreign sales were to customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  korea  singapore  japan 
taiwan accounted for the largest single destination for our product shipments with of our shipments in fiscal compared to of our shipments in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit business segment gross profit dollar amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect gross profit 
overall  gross profit for fiscal decreased million to million from in fiscal this lower gross profit is primarily due to reduced industry wide demand  particularly for automatic ball bonders sold within our equipment segment 
to a lesser extent  the lower gross profit was caused by higher unit costs within our test business segment resulting from decreased demand for our test products and duplicate production costs as we increased production capacity at our china facility to allow for the transfer and shutdown of certain test segment production operations in europe and the united states 
gross margin which represents gross profit divided by revenues decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a product mix shift from higher margin equipment sales to lower margin package materials segment sales  and to higher unit costs within our test segment 

table of contents for fiscal  gross profit for the equipment segment decreased million to million from million in fiscal  as industry wide demand for automatic ball bonders declined sharply 
our equipment segment gross margin increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal for fiscal  gross profit for our packaging materials segment decreased million to million from million in fiscal this million net reduction was primarily due to lower average selling prices for our capillary products caused by pricing pressures that amounted to million  which was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of million from increased gold wire sales 
our packaging materials segment gross margin declined to during fiscal from in fiscal this decline in gross margin was primarily due to a higher percentage of lower margin wire sales compared to other packaging materials sold  as wire sales increased during fiscal from fiscal an increase in the cost of gold also contributed to the decline in gross margins during fiscal  compared to fiscal for fiscal  gross profit for our test segment decreased million to million from million in fiscal our test segment gross margin also declined to during fiscal  from in fiscal this decline in gross profit and gross margin was due to higher unit costs caused by lower production volumes as demand for our test products decreased and lower average selling prices 
increased unit costs associated with the production capacity added to our china facility to provide for the transfer and shutdown of certain test segment operations in europe and the united states also contributed to the lower gross margin

research and development research and development expenses for fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal approximately one half of the increase was caused by an increase in compensation costs caused by an increase in headcount with the other half of the increase resulting from an increase in engineering prototype expenses as we increased our investment in the research and development of next generation products for the ball bonder  package test and vertical test product lines 

table of contents resizing the company recorded resizing charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the company reversed million of these resizing charges and in fiscal it reversed million of these resizing charges as the actual severance costs were less than the costs originally estimated 
in addition to the formal resizing costs identified below  the company continued and is continuing to downsize its operations 
these downsizing efforts resulted in workforce reduction charges  consisting primarily of severance and benefit payments  of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in contrast to the resizing plans discussed above  these workforce reductions were not related to formal or distinct restructurings  but rather  the normal and recurring management of employment levels in response to business conditions and our ongoing effort to reduce the company s cost structure 
these recurring workforce reduction charges were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses

payments for operating lease commitments are expected to continue into fiscal intangible asset impairment other than goodwill the following table presents a summary of the intangible asset impairment charges recorded for the fiscal years ended september  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales intangible asset impairment 
table of contents our identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill were comprised of complete technology and customer accounts and relate to our test segment 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform impairment testing of identifiable intangible assets if impairment triggers have been identified 
our identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows  and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values 
the identifiable other intangible assets in our test segment were comprised of customer accounts and complete technology 
we manage and value our complete technology in the aggregate as one asset group 
during fiscal  we tested the identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill of the test segment for potential impairment due to the existence of impairment triggers  which were difficulties in the development of new test products  challenges in the introduction of these products  and greater than expected losses incurred in the test segment 
due to the amount of other intangible assets associated with the company s test reporting unit  the company retained an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the test reporting unit s fair value 
based on these analyses  it was determined that the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets as calculated using the undiscounted future cash flows was less than the carrying value of the net assets of the test segment 
as such  an asset impairment charge totaling million was recorded during the three months ended june  to fully write off the customer account and complete technology assets of the test segment 
of this charge  million represented customer accounts and million represented complete technology intangible assets 
during fiscal we performed interim impairment testing of our intangible assets other than goodwill as a result of the sale of certain assets of the test segment  and recorded an impairment charge of million associated with the reporting unit s purchased technology intangible asset 
goodwill impairment the following table presents a summary of the test segment goodwill impairment charges recorded for the fiscal years ended september  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales goodwill impairment we had goodwill that related to two of our reporting units 
the reporting units were the bonding wire unit  which is included in our packaging materials segment  and the test business unit  comprising the company s test segment 
we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill at the end of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with the completion of our annual forecasting process 
we also test for impairment between our annual tests if a triggering event occurs that may have the effect of reducing the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
when conducting our goodwill impairment analysis  we calculate our potential impairment charges based on the two step test identified in sfas and using the fair value of the respective reporting units 
we use the present value of future cash flows from the respective reporting units to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of goodwill 
due to the existence of impairment triggers  in june  we performed interim impairment tests on the test segment s goodwill and other long lived tangible and intangible assets 
these triggers included the identification of difficulties in the development of new test products  challenges in the introduction of these products  and greater than expected losses incurred by the test segment 
the company retained an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the test reporting unit s fair value 
the implied fair value of the test reporting unit goodwill was determined by discounting the projected future cash flows from this reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit and then performing an allocation of this fair value to the fair value of the tangible and 
table of contents identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit  with the residual representing the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on these analyses  a goodwill impairment charge totaling million was identified and recorded during fiscal to completely write off the goodwill of the test reporting unit 
no impairment charge was recorded for the packaging materials segment s goodwill  as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value goodwill exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill as of september  amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal year ended september  was million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in amortization expense of million was due to the intangible asset impairment write downs recorded during the third quarter of fiscal gain on sale of assets for the fiscal year ended september   the million net gain on sale of assets consists of a gain on the sale of our wedge bonding technology of million  the gain on the sale of land and building in gilbert  arizona previously owned by a variable interest entity of million  and the loss on disposal of assets used in our test business segment of million 
in fiscal  we realized a gain of million on the sale of land and a building and million on the sale of a portion of our pc board business 
income loss from operations income loss from operations by business segment appears below dollar amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales equipment packaging materials test corporate and other for fiscal  we incurred a loss from operations of million  compared to income from operations of million in fiscal this change from income to a loss was primarily due to non cash intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges of million that were recorded during fiscal and a million decline in sales caused by reduced industry wide demand for automatic ball bonders 
for fiscal  income from operations for our equipment business segment decreased million due to reduced industry wide demand for our automatic ball bonders 
income from operations for our packaging materials business segment decreased million due to lower capillary sales caused by pricing pressures and lower industry wide demand 
the increase in the loss from operations of our test business segment was primarily due to three factors goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million  lower revenues caused by reduced industry wide demand  reduced market share  product pricing pressures  and lower demand for our products from our customers  and higher unit costs caused by lower production volumes and the production capacity added to our china facility to provide for the transfer and shutdown of certain test segment operations in europe and the united states 
the loss from operations within our corporate and other segment decreased million during fiscal compared to fiscal this net decrease was primarily due to decreases in employee compensation and incentive compensation expense of million  resizing expense of million  and foreign currency translation losses of million 
these decreases were mostly offset by increases in professional fees and outside services of million  relocation expenses of million  and a decrease in corporate expenses allocated to the company s other business segments of million 

table of contents interest income and expense interest income during fiscal was million higher than in fiscal due to higher rates of return on invested cash balances 
interest expense during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal interest expense in both the current and prior fiscal year primarily reflects interest on our convertible subordinated notes 
the reduction in interest expense for fiscal was due to the early extinguishment of our and convertible subordinated notes and issuance of our and convertible subordinated notes during fiscal charge on early extinguishment of debt in fiscal  we incurred costs of million to redeem our and convertible subordinated notes  of which million was a redemption premium cash charge and million was due to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the initial issuance of the notes during fiscal provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal reflects income tax expense of million  which primarily consists of million of income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions  million for additional foreign income tax exposure  million for the potential repatriation of foreign earnings  and a credit of million associated with a reduction of the valuation allowance on us net operating loss carryfowards due to the planned repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal during fiscal  we increased our valuation allowance against us net operating loss carryforwards by approximately million  which is equal to the amount of deferred tax asset generated by additional us net operating loss carryforwards 
our tax expense in fiscal reflects income tax on income in foreign jurisdictions  alternative minimum tax on us income and a provision for california state income tax 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
we regularly assess the effects resulting from these factors to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
on october   the us government passed the american jobs creation act the act 
the act provides for certain tax benefits including but not limited to the reinvestment of foreign earnings in the united states 
for fiscal  we can elect  under the act  to apply an dividends received deduction against certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations  in which it is a us shareholder 
we have evaluated the potential benefit s under the act and concluded that we are unlikely to derive a material benefit from doing so 
fiscal years ended september  and september  bookings and backlog 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal a booking is recorded when a customer order is reviewed and a determination is made that all specifications can be met  production or service can be scheduled  a delivery date can be set  and the customer meets the company s credit requirements 
at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
for example  on august   we announced that discussions with customers indicated a general slowing in the rate of semiconductor growth 
as a result  some of these customers requested that we delay the shipment of wire bonders previously ordered and included in our backlog of customer orders at june  
table of contents sales business segment net sales dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  change equipment packaging materials test interconnect other na comprised of residual sales associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal sales 
net sales from continuing operations for the year ended september  were million  an increase of from million in fiscal due primarily to the improved demand in the semiconductor industry for our automatic ball bonders throughout the majority of fiscal our equipment segment was the primary beneficiary of the increased demand in the semiconductor industry during fiscal  recording an increase in net sales compared to the prior year 
according to vlsi research  our market share of worldwide revenue for automatic ball bonders for the first half of calendar increased to from in the second half of calendar and in the first half of calendar the higher net sales resulted primarily from a increase in unit sales of our automatic ball bonders 
we recorded our highest quarterly ball bonder unit volume in the history of the company in the second quarter of fiscal this large percentage increase in ball bonder unit sales was partially offset by the elimination of sales of dicing saws in fiscal due to the sale of this business in august  relatively flat sales in specialty bonders and spare parts  and a lower average selling price asp per ball bonder 
the blended asp for our automatic ball bonders was lower than the prior year  due primarily to customer mix 
this reflected general lowering of asp for any particular model over its product life cycle 
to mitigate this we introduce new models with additional features that enable us to realize a higher selling price 
we experienced a higher asp on our newer maxum plus model compared to maxum 
the blended asp varies with the proportion of newer models sold and with customer mix 
our packaging materials business also benefited from the increased demand in the semiconductor industry with a million or increase in net sales 
our capillary unit sales were up in fiscal compared to the prior year 
blended capillary asp was down slightly from the prior year 
the reduction in blended capillary asp is a function of the general decline in unit prices and mix between high and low end capillaries 
high end capillaries support advanced packaging applications and have higher asp s 
as in our equipment business  we introduce new capillaries with additional capabilities that enable us to realize a higher selling price 
our wire unit sales measured in kft increased in fiscal over the prior year due to increased orders from existing customers and new customers 
wire asp is heavily dependent upon the price of gold and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in fiscal the price of gold accounted for approximately million of the sales increase over the prior year and the increase in unit volume accounted for approximately million of the increase 
our test interconnect sales were million in fiscal or above the prior year 
our vertically configured retractable pin probe cards accounted for million of the increase due to higher unit sales 
net sales of our other major test product lines were slightly above the prior year but negatively impacted by the sale of our pc board business in the second quarter of fiscal our sales of pc board products were approximately million lower in fiscal compared to the prior year 
blended asps are not meaningful in the test business due to lack of a standard unit of measure and the large difference in part types sold 
as such  blended asp s are not a metric used by management for test interconnect sales 
the majority of our sales are to customers that are located outside of the united states or that have manufacturing 
table of contents facilities outside of the united states 
shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised of our total sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of these foreign sales were to customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea and japan 
taiwan accounted for the largest single destination for our product shipments with of our shipments in fiscal compared to of our shipments in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit business segment gross profit dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect other na comprised of residual gross profit associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased million in fiscal from the prior year and our gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved percentage points 
the higher gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the improved demand in the semiconductor industry  particularly for our automatic ball bonders 
included in the results for fiscal were million of inventory write downs 
included in the results for fiscal is a charge for inventory write downs of million 
our equipment gross profit increased million from the prior year and the equipment gross margin increased percentage points from the prior year 
the higher sales volume of ball bonders accounted for million of the increased gross profit and an reduction in the manufacturing cost per ball bonders partially offset by the lower asp accounted for million of the improvement 
our lower cost per unit was the main reason for the percentage point increase in gross margin and due to the lowering of production costs over our products life cycle via better supply chain management  engineering more cost effective parts and volume purchasing 
our packaging materials gross profit increased million from the prior year  with capillaries gross profit accounting for million of the increase 
higher capillary unit volume accounted for million of this improvement and lower capillary costs associated with shifting a portion of capillary production to china accounted for million of the variance 
these favorable results were partially offset by lower capillary asp s 
our wire gross profit was approximately million higher than the prior year reflecting higher unit sales measured in kft but the wire gross margin was lower than the prior year due to the increase in the price of gold  which makes up a significant portion of our wire cost of sales 
our test interconnect business gross profit increased million and its gross margin increased percentage points 
the higher gross profit and gross margin was due primarily to higher unit sales in our vertically configured retractable pin probe cards and test sockets product lines and the associated manufacturing efficiencies 
duplicate costs associated with the start up of production of cantilever products in our china facility partially offset the positive impact from the higher vertical and package test sales

sg a expenses were relatively flat when compared with the prior year but sg a expense as a percentage of sales was down percentage points 
in fiscal  sg a expense included a variable expense for incentive compensation of million compared to no expense for incentive compensation in the prior year 
also included in fiscal were severance charges of million million of which was associated with the closing of a probe card production facility in france  and million of start up costs in our china facility to transition production capacity 
included in the sg a expense for fiscal were costs associated with workforce reductions severance of million  start up costs for our new china facility of approximately million  and a million charge for the early termination of an information technology services agreement  partially offset by the favorable reversal of a million reserve previously established for potential obligations to us customs 
other than the above mentioned costs  our sg a costs were lower than the prior year and reflected our efforts to contain operating costs with higher sales volume 
the workforce reduction severance charges identified in the previous paragraph were included in sg a expense because they were not related to formal and distinct restructuring programs  but rather  they were normal and recurring management of employment levels in response to business conditions and our ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
also  if the business conditions had improved  we were prepared to rehire some of these terminated individuals 
these charges are in contrast to the formal and distinct resizing programs we established in prior fiscal years 
research and development 
research and development r d expense in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal while we saw lower payroll and related expenses due to our ongoing cost reduction efforts  we continued to invest in the development of next generation wire bonders and new products for our test interconnect business 
in fiscal we also purchased a license for an interconnection device which we believe will form the nucleus for our next generation of semiconductor sockets for our package test products 
resizing the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns 
the industry experienced excess capacity and a severe contraction in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment during our fiscal  and most of we developed formal resizing plans in response to these changes in the business environment with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
accounting for resizing activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans 
we documented and committed to these plans to reduce spending that included facility closings rationalizations and reductions in workforce 
we recorded the expense associated with these plans in the period that we committed to carry out the plans 
although we made every attempt to consolidate all known resizing activities into one plan  the extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places limitations on achieving this objective 
the recognition of a resizing event does not necessarily preclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods 
in fiscal  we reversed thousand of these resizing charges and in fiscal we reversed thousand of these resizing charges due to the actual severance cost associated with the terminated positions being less than the cost originally estimated 
we recorded resizing charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents in addition to the formal resizing costs identified below  we continued and are continuing to downsize our operations in fiscal  and these downsizing efforts resulted in workforce reduction charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in contrast to the resizing plans discussed above  these workforce reductions were not related to formal or distinct restructurings  but rather  the normal and recurring management of employment levels in response to business conditions and our ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
in addition  during fiscal  if the business conditions were to have improved  we were prepared to rehire some of these terminated individuals 
these recurring workforce reduction charges were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
a summary of the charges  reversals and payments of the formal resizing plans initiated in fiscal appears below in thousands fiscal resizing plans severance and benefits commitments total provision for resizing plans in fiscal continuing operations discontinued operations payment of obligations in fiscal balance  september  change in estimate payment of obligations in fiscal balance  september  change in estimate payment of obligations balance  september  the individual resizing plans and acquisition restructuring plans initiated in fiscal are identified below fourth quarter in january  we acquired the advanced substrate technology of micromodule systems  a cupertino  california company  to enable production of high density substrates 
while showing some progress in developing our substrate technology  the business was not profitable and would have required additional capital and operating cash to complete development of the technology 
in light of the business downturn that was affecting the semiconductor industry at the time  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we could not afford to further develop the substrate technology and would close our substrate operations 
as a result  we recorded a resizing charge of million 
the resizing charge included a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions and lease obligations of million 
we expected  and achieved  annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately million as a result of this resizing plan 
by june   all the positions had been eliminated 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the lease obligations are expected to continue into  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in addition to these resizing charges  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of fixed assets and million of intangible assets associated with the closure of the substrate operation 
this substrate business was included in our then existing advanced packaging business segment 
third quarter as a result of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and our desire to improve the performance of our test business segment  we decided to move towards a hour per day manufacturing model in our major us wafer test facility  which would provide our customers with faster turn around time and delivery of orders and economies of scale in manufacturing 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan to reduce headcount and consolidate manufacturing in our test business segment 
as part of this plan  we moved manufacturing of wafer test products from our facilities in gilbert  arizona and austin  texas to our facilities in san jose  california and dallas  
table of contents texas and from our kaohsuing  taiwan facility to our hsin chu  taiwan facility 
the resizing plan included a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions as a result of the manufacturing consolidation 
the resizing plan also included a charge of million associated with the closure of the kaohsuing  taiwan facility and an austin  texas facility representing costs of non cancelable lease obligations beyond the facility closure and costs required to restore the production facilities to their original state 
we expected  and achieved  annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately thousand as a result of this resizing plan 
all of the positions have been eliminated and both facilities have been closed 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance  facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue through  or such earlier time as the obligations can be satisfied 
second quarter as a result of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and our desire to more efficiently manage our business  in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan comprised of a functional realignment of business management and the consolidation and closure of certain facilities 
in connection with the resizing plan  we recorded a charge of million million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  consisting of severance and benefits of million for positions that were to be eliminated as a result of the functional realignment  facility consolidation  the shift of certain manufacturing to china including the company s hub blade business and the move of our microelectronics products to singapore and a charge of million for the cost of lease commitments beyond the closure date of facilities to be exited as part of the facility consolidation plan 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we closed five test facilities two in the united states  one in france  one in malaysia  and one in singapore 
these operations were absorbed into other company facilities 
the resizing charge for the facility consolidation reflects the cost of lease commitments beyond the exit dates that are associated with these closed test facilities 
to reduce our short term cash requirements  we decided  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  not to relocate our hub blade manufacturing facility from the united states to china or our microelectronics product manufacturing from the united states to singapore  as previously announced 
this change in our facility relocation plan resulted in a reversal of million of the resizing costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as a result  we reduced our expected annual savings from this resizing plan for payroll related expenses by approximately million 
also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed thousand thousand in continuing operations and thousand in discontinued operations of the severance resizing expenses and in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed thousand of resizing expenses  previously recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  due to actual severance costs associated with the terminated positions being less than those estimated as a result of employees leaving the company before they were severed 
as a result of the functional realignment  we terminated employees at all levels of the organization from factory workers to vice presidents 
the organizational change shifted management of our company businesses to functional ie sales  manufacturing  research and development  etc 
areas across product lines rather than by product line 
for example  research and development activities for the entire company are now controlled and coordinated by one corporate vice president under the functional organizational structure  rather than separately by each business unit 
this structure provides for a more efficient allocation of human and capital resources to achieve corporate r d initiatives 
we expected annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately thousand as a result of this resizing plan 
as a result of the decision not to relocate our hub blade manufacturing facility or our microelectronics product manufacturing we ultimately achieved annual payroll related savings of approximately million 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance charges are expected to continue into  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
asset impairment 
in fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million associated with exiting our pc board fabrication business and the closure of a probe card production facility in france 
the fiscal charge included  million associated with the discontinuation of a test product  million due to the reduction in the size of a test facility in dallas  texas  and thousand resulting from the write down of assets that were sold and assets that became obsolete 

table of contents we perform our annual test for impairment of intangible assets at the end of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with the completion of our annual forecasting process 
however  we also test for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs 
we performed interim goodwill impairment tests on the goodwill associated with our test interconnect business during the quarters ended december  and march  due to the existence of an impairment trigger  which was the losses experienced at this business 
based on the results of these tests and our annual impairment test on intangibles assets associated with both our wire and test businesses  no impairment charge was recorded in fiscal the fair value of the wire and test reporting units was based on discounted cash flows of our projected future cash flows from this reporting unit  consistent with the methods used in fiscal and when conducting our goodwill impairment analysis  we calculate our potential impairment charges based on the two step test identified in sfas and using the implied fair value of the respective reporting units 
we use the present value of future cash flows from the respective reporting units to determine the implied fair value 
we also tested our intangible assets for impairment in the march quarter  as a result of the sale of certain assets of the test operations and recorded an impairment charge of million associated with the reporting unit s purchased technology intangible asset 
the million charge is included in the million asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million  to write down assets to their realizable value  in our discontinued flip chip operation 
gain in sale of assets 
in fiscal  we realized a gain of thousand on the sale of land and a building and thousand on the sale of a portion of our pc board business 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense in both fiscal and was associated with our intangible assets for customer accounts and completed technology arising from the acquisition of our test division 
the slightly lower amortization expense in fiscal compared to the prior year was due to the impairment of our complete technology intangible asset mentioned above 
loss on sale of product lines 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the fixed assets  inventories and intellectual property associated with our saw and hard material blade product lines for million in cash 
we wrote off million of net assets associated with the transaction 
in addition  we sold the assets associated with our polymers business for thousand 
this loss on sale of product lines of million has been reclassified to be included in our operating expenses section of the consolidated statement of operations  from its prior presentation outside of the operating results 
income loss from operations income loss from operations by business segments appears below dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect corporate and other  na  na our income from operations in fiscal was million compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior fiscal year 
the turn from a loss to profit generally reflected increased demand in the semiconductor industry throughout most of fiscal and our ongoing efforts to reduce operational expenses 

table of contents equipment operating income increased million from the prior year due primarily to higher sales and gross profit and lower operating costs 
packaging materials operating income increased million  also due primarily to higher sales and gross profit and lower operating costs 
test interconnect operating loss was million or less than the prior year due primarily to higher gross profit 
in order to improve the operating results of this business segment  we plan to consolidate test facilities  transfer a greater portion of the test production to our asian facilities  outsource a greater portion of the test production  and introduce new products 
we expect implementation of this plan will continue through and will result in future period charges and or restructuring charges 
our loss from corporate and other activities was million higher than the prior year due to recording million of employee incentive compensation expense in fiscal compared to no incentive compensation in the prior year 
interest and charge on early extinguishment of debt 
interest income in fiscal was million compared to thousand in the prior fiscal year 
the higher interest income in fiscal was due primarily to higher cash and short term investments 
interest expense in fiscal was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
interest expense in both fiscal and primarily reflects interest on our convertible subordinated notes 
the lower interest expense in fiscal was due to the refinancing of our and convertible subordinated notes with lower interest and convertible subordinated notes 
we also reduced the total amount of subordinated debt outstanding by million 
we incurred a cost of million to redeem our and convertible subordinated notes  of which was a cash expense associated with the redemption premium and was due to the write off of deferred financing expenses associated with the initial issuance of the notes 
tax expense 
tax expense in fiscal reflects income tax on income in foreign jurisdictions  alternative minimum tax on us income and certain state income tax 
in fiscal  we reversed the portion of our valuation allowance approximately million that was equal to our us taxable income  excluding taxable income subject to the us alternative minimum tax 
until we can be reasonably assured that we can utilize our us operating loss carryforwards  our income tax provision will reflect only us alternative minimum tax  certain state tax and foreign taxation 
our tax expense in fiscal reflects income tax on income in foreign jurisdictions 
in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against tax benefits from the fiscal losses in the us discontinued operations 
in february  we entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronics corporation delco providing for the formation and management of flip chip technologies  llc fct 
fct was formed to license certain technologies and to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis 
in march  we purchased the remaining interest in the joint venture owned by delco for million and included fct in our then existing advanced packaging business segment 
in fiscal  our then existing advanced packaging business segment consisted solely of fct  which was not profitable 
in february  we sold the assets of fct for approximately million in cash and notes and the agreement by the buyer to satisfy approximately million of our lease liabilities and the assumption of certain other liabilities 
the sale included fixed assets  inventories  and intellectual property of our flip chip business 
the major classes of fct assets and liabilities sold included million in accounts receivable  thousand in inventory  million in property  plant and equipment  thousand in other long term assets  million in accounts payable and million in accrued liabilities 
we recorded a net loss on the sale of fct of thousand 
net sales from fct in fiscal were million  and in fiscal were million 
the net loss of our former flip chip business unit comprises our discontinued operations 
included in the fiscal loss from discontinued operations is an asset impairment charge of million and a goodwill impairment charge of million 
net income loss 
our net income in fiscal was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
liquidity and capital resources at september   total cash and investments were million compared to million at september   a decrease of million 

table of contents the net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  of million was primarily due to a net change in working capital components of million that was mostly offset by net cash from operations excluding the working capital component changes of million 
the net change in working capital components of million was primarily due to a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from increasing sales levels during the three months ended september   compared to decreasing sales levels during the three months ended september   and extended payment terms that were granted to customers during fiscal this increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and taxes payable of million 
the net cash provided by investing activities of million consisted of net proceeds from investment transactions of million and proceeds from the sale of assets of million that were offset in part  by capital expenditures of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities of million primarily consisted of million of cash received from the direct financing arrangement associated with the willow grove  pennsylvania land and building transaction 
during fiscal  the company entered into a direct financing arrangement involving the sale and leaseback of land and a building housing its corporate headquarters in willow grove  pennsylvania 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  the company accounted for the transaction as a financing and continued to reflect the land and building in its financial statements and recorded the cash received of million as debt 
our primary need for cash for the next fiscal year will be to provide the working capital necessary to meet our expected production and sales levels and to make the necessary capital expenditures to enhance our production and operating activities 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditure needs to be between million and million 
we financed our working capital needs and capital expenditure needs in fiscal through internally generated funds from our equipment and packaging materials businesses and expect to continue to generate cash from operating activities during fiscal to meet our cash needs 
we expect to use the excess cash generated from our equipment and packaging materials business to fund our future growth opportunities  or to redeem a portion of our convertible subordinate notes 
our long term debt at september  and consisted of the following type fiscal year of maturity conversion price rate in thousands september  convertible subordinated notes convertible subordinated notes other fiscal includes a mortgage of million held by a limited liability company which the company began consolidating into its financial statements at december  in accordance with fin the limited liability company was deconsolidated in fiscal in the first half of fiscal year  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement to qualified institutional investors

table of contents in the second half of fiscal year  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement to qualified institutional investors 
the notes mature on june   bear interest at per annum and are convertible into common stock of the company at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment for certain events 
the conversion rights of these notes may be terminated on or after june  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days 
the notes are general obligations of the company and are subordinated to all senior debt 
the notes rank equally with our convertible subordinated notes 
there are no financial covenants associated with the notes and there are no restrictions on incurring additional debt or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
interest on the notes is payable on june and december of each year 
we used million of net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes to redeem all of our convertible subordinated notes 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes along with cash remaining from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes and cash from operations to purchase all of our convertible subordinated notes at purchase prices between and of the principal amount of the notes 
these actions resulted in a reduction in interest expense to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the company recorded a pretax charge of million associated with the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes 
the company recorded a pretax charge of million associated with the purchase of the convertible subordinated notes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  during fiscal the company recorded debt of million all classified as a current liability as of september   as part of accounting for a sale leaseback transaction as a direct financing arrangement 
monthly lease payments of million  which are allocated by the company to interest expense and amortization of the debt  are scheduled through may at which time the land and building and remaining debt outstanding will be removed from the company s financial statements  and the deferred gain will be recognized 
interest expense is calculated using the company s incremental borrowing rate  which is estimated to be 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
certain of the following commitments as of september  have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations included in this form k  however  they have been disclosed in the following table in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity 
the most significant of these are our operating lease commitments and inventory purchase obligations 

table of contents the following table identifies obligations and contingent payments under various arrangements at september   including those not included in our consolidated balance sheet in thousands total amounts due in less than year amounts due in years amounts due in years amounts due in more than years contractual obligations long term debt operating lease obligations debt associated with direct financing arrangement inventory purchase obligations commercial commitments gold supply financing guarantee standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments  represents contractual amounts not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at september  long term debt includes the amounts due under our convertible subordinated notes due and our convertible subordinated notes due the operating lease obligations at september  represent obligations due under various facility and equipment leases with terms up to fifteen years in duration  including the obligations associated with our new property lease in fort washington  pennsylvania that will house our corporate headquarters beginning in fiscal debt associated with direct financing arrangement represents the proceeds received on the land and building transaction 
inventory purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase commitments for inventory components ordered in the normal course of business 
the gold supply agreement includes gold inventory purchases we are obligated to pay for upon shipment of the fabricated gold to our customers 
the standby letters of credit represent obligations in lieu of security deposits for a gold financing agreement  a facility lease  and employee benefit programs 
at september   the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million  and the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million 
the fair values were determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of our other assets and liabilities approximates the book value of those assets and liabilities 
at september   the standard poor s rating on our and convertible subordinated notes was ccc 
we have a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees who were employed on september  the benefits for this plan were based on the employees years of service and the employees compensation during the three years before retirement 
our funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of us federal employee benefit and tax laws 
we contributed approximately million based on the market price at the time of contribution in company stock to the plan in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  we expect to make a contribution of company common stock of approximately million 
effective december   the benefits under the company s pension plan were frozen 
as a consequence  accrued benefits no longer change as a result of an employee s length of service or compensation 
we believe that our existing cash reserves and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  our liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on normal operations of the business and others related to uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
we may seek  as we believe appropriate  additional debt or equity financing to provide capital for corporate purposes 
we may also seek additional debt or equity 
table of contents financing for the refinancing or redemption of existing debt and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions  competitive factors  the condition of financial markets and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities which we may elect to pursue 
risk factors risks relating to our business the semiconductor industry is volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns our operating results are significantly affected by the capital expenditures of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors  including personal computers  telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics  and automotive goods 
significant downturns in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by industry wide retrenchment 
these periodic downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected our business  financial condition and operating results 
they have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity  and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
these downturns historically have severely and negatively affected the industry s demand for capital equipment  including the assembly equipment  the packaging materials and test solutions that we sell 
there can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products  and in any case  we believe the historical volatility both upward and downward will persist 
we may experience increasing price pressure our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price 
the length and severity of the fiscal fiscal economic downturn increased cost pressure on our customers and we have observed increasing price sensitivity on their part 
in response  we are actively seeking to reduce our cost structure by moving operations to lower cost areas and by reducing other operating costs 
if we are unable to realize prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of performance and service  our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future in the past  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
we expect that they will continue to fluctuate 
although these fluctuations are partly due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry  they also reflect other factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause our revenues and or operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are market downturns  the mix of products that we sell because  for example our test business has lower margins than assembly equipment and packaging materials  some lines of equipment within our business segments are more profitable than others  and 
table of contents some sales arrangements have higher margins than others  the volume and timing of orders for our products and any order postponements  virtually all of our orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer without prior notice and with limited or no penalties  competitive pricing pressures may force us to reduce prices to retain the business  higher than anticipated costs of development or production of new equipment models  the availability and cost of the components for our products  unanticipated delays in the development and manufacture of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and market acceptance of these products when introduced  customers delay in purchasing our products due to anticipation that we or our competitors may introduce new or upgraded products  and our competitors introduction of new products 
many of our expenses  such as research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense  do not vary directly with our net sales 
our research and development efforts include long term projects lasting a year or more  which require significant investments 
in order to realize the benefits of these projects  we believe that we must continue to fund them during periods when our net sales have declined 
as a result  a decline in our net sales would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net sales  our operating results would decline 
in a downturn  we may have excess inventory  which is required to be written off 
some of the other factors that may cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  severance  resizing and other costs of relocating facilities  inventory write offs due to obsolescence  and inflationary increases in the cost of labor or materials 
because our revenues and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  we believe that consecutive period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
we may not be able to rapidly develop  manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business we believe that our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we must introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner in response to customers demands for higher performance assembly equipment  leading edge materials and for test solutions customized to address rapid technological advances in integrated circuits and capital equipment designs 
our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer performance  features and lower prices that may render our products less competitive 
the development and commercialization of new products requires significant capital expenditures over an extended period of time  and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable 
in addition  we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner that will satisfy our customers future needs or achieve market acceptance 

table of contents most of our sales and a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states  and we rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain product lines  all of which subject us to risks  including risks from changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  political instability and war approximately of our net sales for fiscal  of our net sales for fiscal and of our net sales for fiscal were to customers located outside of the united states  in particular to customers located in the asia pacific region 
we expect this trend to continue 
thus  our future performance will depend  in significant part  on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets  particularly in the asia pacific region 
these economies have been highly volatile  resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies  and political and economic instability 
these conditions may continue or worsen  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we also rely on non united states suppliers for materials and components used in our products  and most of our manufacturing operations are located in countries other than the united states 
we manufacture our automatic ball bonders and bonding wire in singapore  we manufacture capillaries in israel and china  bonding wire in switzerland  test products in taiwan  china and france  and we have sales  service and support personnel in china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and europe 
we also rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain of our product lines 
as a result  a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international  and particularly asia pacific  commerce  such as risks of war and civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt markets  seizure of our foreign assets  including cash  longer payment cycles in foreign markets  international exchange restrictions  restrictions on the repatriation of our assets  including cash  significant foreign and united states taxes on repatriated cash  the difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations  possible disagreements with tax authorities regarding transfer pricing regulations  episodic events outside our control such as  for example  an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or influenza  tariff and currency fluctuations  changing political conditions  labor conditions and costs  foreign governments monetary policies and regulatory requirements  less protective foreign intellectual property laws  and legal systems which are less developed and which may be less predictable than those in the united states 
because most of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars  an increase in value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen  will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors 
our ability to compete overseas in the future may be materially and adversely affected by a strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 

table of contents our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the united states and those foreign countries in which our customers  subcontractors  and materials suppliers have operations 
a protectionist trade environment in either the united states or those foreign countries in which we do business  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance or other trade policies  may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
historically  our primary exposures have related to net receivables denominated in currencies other than a foreign subsidiaries functional currency  and remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries net monetary assets from the subsidiaries local currency into the subsidiaries functional currency the us dollar 
in general  an increase in the value of the us dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record translation and remeasurement gains 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record losses on translation and remeasurement 
an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars  and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials 
an increase in the value of china s yuan could increase our material  labor  and other operating expenses in china 
our board has granted management with limited authority to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and other instruments designed to minimize the short term impact currency fluctuations have on our business 
we have entered into a foreign exchange forward contract and expect to enter into additional foreign exchange forward contracts and other instruments in the future 
our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful and may result in a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
we may not be able to consolidate manufacturing facilities without incurring unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business in an effort to further reduce our cost structure  we are closing some of our manufacturing facilities and expanding others 
we may incur significant and unexpected costs  delays and disruptions to our business during this consolidation process 
because of unanticipated events  including the actions of governments  suppliers  employees or customers  we may not realize the synergies  cost reductions and other benefits of any consolidation to the extent or within the timeframe that we currently expect 
our business depends on attracting and retaining management  marketing and technical employees our future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees 
in particular  we periodically experience shortages of technical personnel 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain the managerial  marketing and technical personnel we require  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
difficulties in forecasting demand for our product lines may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excesses we typically operate our business with limited visibility of future demand 
as a result  we sometimes experience inventory shortages or excesses 
we generally order supplies and otherwise plan our production based on internal forecasts of demand 
we have in the past  and may again in the future  fail to forecast accurately demand for our products  in terms of both volume and configuration for either our current or next generation wire bonders 
this has led to and may in the future lead to delays in product shipments or  alternatively  an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
if we fail to forecast accurately demand for our products  including assembly equipment  packaging materials and test solutions  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents advanced packaging technologies other than wire bonding may render some of our products obsolete advanced packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance or reduce the size of an integrated circuit package  as compared to traditional die and wire bonding 
these technologies include flip chip and chip scale packaging 
some of these advanced technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection between a die and its package 
the semiconductor industry may  in the future  shift a significant part of its volume into advanced packaging technologies  such as those discussed above  which do not employ our products 
if a significant shift to advanced packaging technologies were to occur  demand for our wire bonders and related packaging materials may be materially and adversely affected 
because a small number of customers account for most of our sales  our revenues could decline if we lose a significant customer the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems purchasing a substantial portion of our semiconductor assembly equipment  packaging materials and test solutions 
sales to a relatively small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
during fiscal   and  sales to advanced semiconductor engineering  our largest customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we expect that sales of our products to a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
thus  our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our important customers 
any one of a number of factors could adversely affect these relationships 
if  for example  during periods of escalating demand for our equipment  we were unable to add inventory and production capacity quickly enough to meet the needs of our customers  they may turn to other suppliers making it more difficult for us to retain their business 
similarly  if we are unable for any other reason to meet production or delivery schedules  particularly during a period of escalating demand  our relationships with our key customers could be adversely affected 
if we lose orders from a significant customer  or if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially  these losses or reductions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for raw materials  components and subassemblies 
if our suppliers do not deliver their products to us  we would be unable to deliver our products to our customers our products are complex and require raw materials  components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability  accuracy and performance 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of these components and subassemblies and we rely on sole source suppliers for some important components and raw materials  including gold 
as a result  we are exposed to a number of significant risks  including lack of control over the manufacturing process for components and subassemblies  changes in our manufacturing processes  in response to changes in the market  which may delay our shipments  our inadvertent use of defective or contaminated raw materials  the relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our suppliers  which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies  components or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices  reliability or quality problems with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers as to which we may not have any short term alternative  shortages caused by disruptions at our suppliers and subcontractors for a variety of reasons  including work stoppage or fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters  delays in the delivery of raw materials or subassemblies  which  in turn  may delay our shipments  and the loss of suppliers as a result of consolidation of suppliers in the industry 

table of contents if we are unable to deliver products to our customers on time for these or any other reasons  if we are unable to meet customer expectations as to cycle time  or if we do not maintain acceptable product quality or reliability  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
our test business presents significant management and operating challenges during fiscal  we acquired two companies that design and manufacture test solutions  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation  and combined their operations to create our test business 
since its acquisition in  this business has not performed to our expectations 
during june  we performed interim impairment tests on our test segment goodwill due to the existence of impairment triggers  which were difficulties in the development of new test products  anticipated challenges in the introduction of these new products  and greater than expected losses incurred by the test segment 
as a result of these impairment tests  a test segment goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge was required in our third fiscal quarter in the amount of million 
our plan to correct the problems faced by our test business centers on the following steps standardize production processes between the various test manufacturing sites  create and ramp production of our highest volume products in a new lower cost site in china and or outsource production where appropriate  then rationalize excess capacity by converting existing higher cost  low volume manufacturing sites to service centers 
our plan to achieve profitability in our test business also depends upon the successful development  manufacture and sale of new test products on a timely and cost effective basis 
if we are unable to successfully implement our plans  our operating margins  results of operations and financial condition would continue to be adversely affected by the poor performance of our test business 
in the alternative  in the event that we exit our test business  via a sale or disposal of the assets  we may incur further material charges 
diversification into multiple businesses increases demands on our management and systems we may from time to time in the future seek to expand through acquisition 
any significant acquisition would increase demands on our management  financial resources and information and internal control systems 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to manage and integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses and to successfully implement  improve and expand our systems  procedures and controls 
if we fail to integrate businesses successfully or to develop the necessary internal procedures to manage diversified businesses  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment  packaging materials and test solutions industries the semiconductor equipment  packaging materials and test solutions industries are very competitive 
in the semiconductor equipment and test solutions markets  significant competitive factors include performance  quality  customer support and price 
in the semiconductor packaging materials industry  competitive factors include price  delivery and quality 
in each of our markets  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants 
in addition  established competitors may combine to form larger  better capitalized companies 
some of our competitors have or may have significantly greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of these competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers who appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
we expect our competitors to improve their current products performance  and to introduce new products and materials with improved price and performance characteristics 
our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to or better than ours 
new product and materials introductions by our competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales 
if a particular semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor s product or materials for a particular assembly operation  we may not be able to sell products or materials to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time because 
table of contents manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relations with suppliers  and assembly equipment in our industry often goes years without requiring replacement 
in addition  we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete in these or other areas in the future 
if we cannot compete successfully  we could be forced to reduce prices  and could lose customers and market share and experience reduced margins and profitability 
our success depends in part on our intellectual property  which we may be unable to protect our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
to protect this technology  we rely principally on contractual restrictions such as nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we also rely  in some cases  on patent and copyright protection 
we may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons  including the following employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and customers may violate their contractual agreements  and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive  or those agreements may be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate  foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology  our patents or copyrights may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology 
in addition  our partners and alliances may also have rights to technology that we develop 
we may incur significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be weakened 
third parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property  which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses  or prevent us from selling some of our products the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  with frequent introductions of new products and technologies 
industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others  creating a risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims that they infringe on the intellectual property of others 
we may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement 
if we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others  we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture  market or use the affected product  or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing or re engineering our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly  impractical or time consuming 
occasionally  third parties assert that we are  or may be  infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights 
in these cases  we will defend against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate 
intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if we become involved in this type of litigation  it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business 
some of our customers are parties to litigation brought by the lemelson medical  education and research foundation limited partnership lemelson  in which lemelson claims that certain manufacturing processes used by those customers infringe patents held by lemelson 
we have never been named a party to any such litigation 
some customers have requested that we indemnify them to the extent their liability for these claims arises from use of our equipment 
we do not believe that products sold by us infringe valid lemelson patents 
if a claim for contribution were to be brought against us  we believe we would have valid defenses to assert and also would have rights to contribution and claims against our suppliers 
we have not incurred any material liability with respect to the lemelson claims or any other pending intellectual property claim to date and we do not believe that these claims will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the ultimate outcome of any infringement or misappropriation claim that might be made  however  is uncertain and we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such claim would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we may be materially and adversely affected by environmental and safety laws and regulations we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous material  investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and the health and safety of our employees 
increasingly  public attention has focused on the environmental impact of manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations 
proper waste disposal plays an important role in the operation of our manufacturing plants 
in many of our facilities we maintain wastewater treatment systems that remove metals and other contaminants from process wastewater 
these facilities operate under permits that must be renewed periodically 
a violation of those permits may lead to revocation of the permits  fines  penalties or the incurrence of capital or other costs to comply with the permits  including potential shutdown of operations 
in the future  existing or new land use and environmental regulations may impose upon us the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements  restrict our ability to expand our operations  subject us to liability for  among other matters  remediation  and or cause us to curtail our operations 
we cannot assure you that any costs or liabilities associated with complying with these environmental laws will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  and under pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a fundamental change 
for example  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that classify our board of directors into four classes  with one class being elected each year  permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval  and prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of or more of our voting securities without super majority board or stockholder approval 
further  under the pennsylvania business corporation law  because our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  stockholders may remove directors only for cause 
these provisions and some other provisions of the pennsylvania business corporation law could delay  defer or prevent us from experiencing a fundamental change and may adversely affect our common stockholders voting and other rights 
terrorist attacks  or other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate and our profitability terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
terrorist attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
our primary facilities include administrative  sales and r d facilities in the united states and manufacturing facilities in the united states  singapore  china and israel 
additional terrorist attacks may disrupt the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels for all of our facilities 
furthermore  additional attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products in the united states and overseas 
additional attacks or any broader conflict  could negatively impact on our domestic and international sales  our supply chain  our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of terrorist attacks or armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we may be unable to generate enough cash to repay our debt our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other activities will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
if our convertible debt is not converted to our common shares  we will be required to make annual cash interest payments of million in each of fiscal years through  million in fiscal and million in fiscal on our aggregate million of convertible subordinated debt 
principal payments of million and million on the convertible subordinated debt are due in fiscal and  respectively 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness is affected by the volatile nature of our business  and general economic  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
our indebtedness poses risks to our business  including that insufficient cash flow from operations to repay our outstanding indebtedness when it becomes due may force us to sell assets  or seek additional capital  which we may be unable to do at all or on terms favorable to us  and our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash in an amount sufficient to enable us to service interest  principal and other payments on our debt  including the notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we are not restricted under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness from incurring additional debt in the future 
if new debt is added to our current levels  our leverage and our debt service obligations would increase and the related risks described above could intensify 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
we have historically used broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce 
currently  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income of using the fair value recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb and accordingly  we do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after june  under sfas no 
r  companies must expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards as of the date the company grants the awards to employees 
the expense would be recognized over the vesting period for each option and adjusted for actual forfeitures that occur before vesting 
we have adopted fas r for our fiscal year adoption of fas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and statement of cash flows see note to consolidated financial statements accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  adoption of fas r could negatively impact our ability to utilize employee stock plans to recruit and retain employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace failure to receive shareholder approval for additional employee stock options and other equity compensation may adversely affect our ability to hire and retain employees 
currently  we do not have an employee equity compensation plan in place that would allow us to issue meaningful additional equity compensation to employees 
our board of directors approved an equity stock compensation plan and recommended the plan to shareholders for approval at our annual shareholder meeting 
the shareholders did not approve the plan 
if we do not receive shareholder approval of a new plan at our annual shareholder meeting that provides for a sufficient number and type of awards  our ability to hire and retain employees may be adversely affected 
in an effort to remain competitive in the employee marketplace  we may decide to increase employees cash compensation  which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we have the ability to issue additional equity securities  which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities will result in dilution of existing stockholders equity interests in us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue  without vote or action of stockholders  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  and has the ability to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of any such series 
any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
in addition  we are authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to an aggregate of million shares of common stock  of which approximately million shares were outstanding as of september  we are also authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments corporate bonds  commercial paper and us treasury and agency securities 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities and target an average life to maturity of less than eighteen months 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
at september   we had a non trading investment portfolio of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of million see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
our international operations  particularly those in switzerland and france  are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to transactions denominated in currencies other than the location s functional currency the swiss franc and the euro 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations due to remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our israel and singapore operations local currencies into the location s functional currency  the us dollar 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at september   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the foreign currency portfolio to the us dollar could have approximately a million impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows for a three month period 
this impact is heavily dependent on numerous factors associated with our foreign operations  including sales to certain customers  product mix and demand  and expense levels 
in october we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract and may enter into additional foreign exchange forward contracts and other instruments designed to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our business 
our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful and may result in a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows
