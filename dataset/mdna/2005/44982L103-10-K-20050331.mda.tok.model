item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and our financial condition together with our consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the statement of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
overview our business during the last quarter of  we undertook a fundamental restructuring to position ourselves as the leader in immersive imaging technologies for visual intelligence applications 
we develop immersive video and still photography products for major markets in surveillance  visual documentation and forensic analysis 
this restructuring included the merging of the infomedia and the ipix security business units and a change in our sales structure that broadens our emphasis from direct sales to a channel development focus 
the new structure also enables us to develop product offerings that include both video and still products for customers in the same market 
ipix has aligned its product lines with our core competencies in immersive video and still photography 
the restructuring was completed with the sale of the admission business unit in february of in accordance with fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets and liabilities related to the admission business unit were classified as held for sale at december   and the operations of this business unit were considered discontinued operations 
immersive video products formerly the security business unit  the immersive video products unit provides a full degree immersive video capability for government and commercial security markets 
patent protected technology is used in digital video systems that provide complete and continuous situational awareness 
these products are currently being marketed to the government for security applications  visual documentation and surveillance 
immersive still photography products formerly the infomedia business unit  the immersive still photography products unit provides for creation of full degree panoramic photography and movies content 
markets for these products are professional photographers  ad and creative media agencies  web developers and creators of visual documentation

business models immersive video sell camera systems via world wide network of distributors 
camera systems will retail from  to  depending upon model and configuration 
traditional distributor discounts will apply 
immersive still market software platform and supporting hardware products primarily over the internet 
business trends and conditions on march   we launched a new family of full degree real time video camera systems 
shipment of these products to distributors began in late june these new camera systems are expected to generate revenues from their sale primarily to distributors 
during the third quarter of  we received an order for the purchase of million of commandview video surveillance cameras from our uk distributor 
we shipped million of cameras from this order in the third quarter of and million of cameras from this order in the fourth quarter of we expect that the remaining cameras from this order will ship over the first six months in we continue to develop additional products and features for the security and surveillance market 
our full degree technology used by the immersive still photography products primarily generates revenues in two ways licenses of software and the sale of camera equipment 
in the past  we utilized keys to license our technology to capture and save a single immersive image 
with the launch of the ipix interactive studio  we now offer time based seat or user licenses which permit an unlimited number of immersive images to be captured and saved within a specific time period  usually a year 
we sell our immersive products and services primarily into the real estate  travel and hospitality and visual documentation markets 
the cost of sales for our licenses is low in proportion to the related revenue 
the cost of sales for the sale of camera equipment has generally been to of related revenues 
on october   the license agreement dated january  the license agreement between us and homestore virtual tours  inc homestore was terminated 
under the license agreement  homestore had the exclusive right to sell our virtual tour technology to the us residential real estate market and was required to pay us a royalty for each virtual tour sold 
as a result of the termination  homestore no longer has the exclusive right to sell our virtual tour technology to the us residential real estate market  and we may sell  or license another third party to sell  our virtual tour technology into this market 
ipix and homestore mutually released each other from any further obligations under the license agreement 
our immersive still photography products business unit will now market and sell our virtual tour photography solution  the ipix interactive studio  directly to the us real estate market and homestore will expand its hometour program to support in addition to us  a wider range of imaging technologies 
as a result  we believe that real estate agents and photographers will benefit from a broader choice of panoramic imaging solutions and enhanced marketing capabilities 
the companies will continue to work together to grow the adoption of virtual tours in the us real estate industry 
we also provide professional services to customers that request specific customizations or integrations of our products and services 
providing professional services is labor intensive and our cost of sales for professional service tends to be to of revenues 

table of contents ipix international in the third quarter of  we entered into license  distribution and trademark agreements with soroof international  a saudi arabia based corporation soroof 
under the agreements  soroof became the exclusive distributor for ipix infomedia products outside of north america and asia through soroof s newly established entity  ipix international ipix i 
under the terms of the agreements  we received a minority equity interest in ipix i 
during the six months ended december   we recognized million of revenue under these agreements

on march   the parties mutually terminated these agreements  and we returned our minority equity interest in ipix i

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible receivables  inventory reserves  intangible and other long lived assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves  valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets  and significant accruals 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and our financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
revenue recognition 
table of contents we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we derive revenue from product sales and services we provide to customers 
product revenue includes immersive still and video hardware and licenses formerly infomedia and security  as well as admission license revenue 
service revenues are primarily from transactions where a seller uses our image management products to enhance their on line offering 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  there are no significant vendor obligations  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
if there are continuing obligations  then license fees are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue from product sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment sell in if the distributor relationship does not create substantial uncertainty regarding fixed or determinable fees and collectibility 
if at the beginning of an arrangement we determine the arrangement fee is not  or is presumed to not be  fixed or determinable  or there is uncertainty over collectibility  revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due or collected 
transaction hosting revenue is recognized ratably as transactions are performed provided there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee was fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured 
revenue generated from professional services is recognized as the related services are performed 
when such professional services are combined with on going transaction services or are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized while the transaction services are performed  on a percentage of completion method or not until the contract is completed in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and arb no 
 long term construction type contracts 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred are characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
where multiple elements exist in an arrangement  the arrangement fee is allocated to the different elements based upon verifiable objective evidence of the fair value of the elements  as governed under eitf  which is codified in sab multiple element arrangements primarily involve an arrangement with professional services and transaction hosting 
revenue is recognized as each element is earned  namely upon completion of the services  provided that the fair value of the undelivered element s has been determined  the delivered element has stand alone value  there is no right of return on delivered element s  and we are in control of delivery of the undelivered element s 
royalties derived from desktop imaging products were recognized as revenues upon receipt of the royalty sell through reports from customers  which are generally in the quarter following the quarter in which the sale by the customer took place 
payments received in advance are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably as obligations are fulfilled 
allowances for doubtful accounts significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of expense recorded if management had different judgment or utilized different estimates 
reserve for inventory obsolescence 
table of contents significant management estimates must be made and used in conjunction with establishing the inventory obsolescence reserve in any accounting period 
this may occur as a result of technological advances  out of production sub assemblies  radical changes in market demand or change of suppliers 
management periodically reviews the inventory aging  turnover  sales forecast as well as input from vendors in determining the appropriate amount of reserve 
goodwill we evaluated goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the goodwill 
these estimates included forecasted revenues and operating expenses  which are inherently difficult to predict 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about fair values 
during the fourth quarter of  certain events  including the end of the agreement with ebay  led the company to perform an impairment review of goodwill 
the ebay agreement ended in november and was the primary source of cash flows for the technology associated with goodwill in the admission business unit 
this review indicated that goodwill was being carried at amounts in excess of the fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the admission business unit 
as a result  an impairment charge was recorded to expense in the year ended december  significant accruals  including restructuring charges and sales tax we recorded restructuring charges associated with vacated facilities 
the key assumptions associated with these charges include the timing and amount of sub lease income 
in addition  in establishing and providing for sales tax accruals  we make judgments based on the actual tax laws and guidance 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding tax liabilities are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may materially affect our future financial results 
restructuring actions we executed several restructuring actions throughout  and these actions and the charges relating to them are described below 
in september  million of restructuring charges were recorded related to expenses associated primarily with a negotiated buy out of certain lease obligations for previously vacated offices 
we paid approximately million during the fourth quarter of to end our continuing obligations under certain of those leases related to our canadian operations 
during the fourth quarter in and  million and million  respectively  of restructuring charges were recorded related to expenses associated with the lease obligations from previously vacated office space in san ramon  ca 
we anticipate to incur costs of approximately million in connection with the sale of the admission business unit and the closing of its san ramon office 
these costs include approximately million in lease termination costs  million in asset disposal cost  million in severance expenses and million associated with accelerated vesting of options held by transferred employees 
the activity in the current and long term restructuring accruals for the years ended december  were as follows 
table of contents balance at payments balance at payments balance at payments balance at december  expense in write offs december  expense in write offs december  expense in write offs december  in thousands in in in restructuring provisions severance other total outlook we have only a limited operating history  and our business model has been modified substantially over the past three years 
our prospects should be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  be able to continue to deliver high quality products and services  respond to highly competitive developments  attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  implement and successfully execute our marketing plans  continue to upgrade our technologies  develop new distribution channels  and improve our operational and financial systems 
although our revenue grew significantly following our formation  during recent periods  we have been unable to sustain this growth and have had to reduce our expense structure 
in addition  our product mix and business units have changed over the past few years 
in early  we sold our admission business unit to admission corporation 
therefore  you should not consider our historical growth indicative of future revenue levels or operating results 
in order to reduce our operating costs to a sustainable level given current revenues  we have gone through several restructurings during the last three years 
we begin focusing our core business on our immersive still and video imaging product lines 
in addition  we are subject to generally prevailing economic conditions and  as such  our success in will be dependent upon our ability to provide quality products and services  the success of our customers and the appropriations processes of various commercial and governmental entities 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the development  sale and marketing of new products for the security market  which may consume our cash reserves 
we are monitoring our cash position carefully and evaluating our future operating cash requirements in the context of our strategy  business objectives and expected business performance 
our focus in will be to manage cash requirements and focus our operations on efficient spending

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment to replace sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires  among other things  that all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  be measured based on their grant date fair value and recognized as expense in the financial statements effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  unless observable market prices exist  the grant date fair value is estimated using an appropriate option pricing model as determined by management 
management must also make certain assumptions about employee option exercise habits  forfeiture rates and select an appropriate amortization methodology for recognizing compensation expense 
the statement requires a modified prospective method of adoption 
under this method  compensation expense will be recorded in the financial statements for all awards granted after july  and the future vesting of awards outstanding as of july  companies may also elect to restate their previously issued financial statements to provide consistency across all periods presented under a modified retrospective method 
management believes the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share but has not yet determined the method of adoption that will be applied or whether adoption will result in expense amounts materially different from those currently provided under the pro forma disclosures see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k
