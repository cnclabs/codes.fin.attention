critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the packaging industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit committee 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of its obligation is complete  its price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the company is reasonably assured of collecting 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
determination of these criteria  in some cases  require management s judgments 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
long lived assets and intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
recoverability of long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then long lived assets are written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
recoverability of goodwill is determined under a two step process as described in sfas the fair value of reporting units determined under step one is also based on a discounted cash flow model 
at december   no impairment has been identified 
forecasted cash flows are based upon numerous assumptions used by management  such as revenue growth  margins and asset management 
for purposes of this analysis  the company reviews its internal forecasts and external data 
the external data consist of data available from customer and competitor commentary  and industry forecasts of future revenue growth 
the estimates of expected cash flows require the company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of the company s control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances for doubtful accounts are determined by reviewing specific accounts that the company has deemed are at risk of being uncollectable and other credit risks associated with groups of customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or economic conditions were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required with a resulting charge to results of operations 
inventory the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company fully reserves for inventories deemed obsolete 
the company performs periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through its planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required with a resulting charge to operations 
deferred income taxes the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and equity prices 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank accounts in us dollars  and their valuation would not be affected by market risk 
the company has four debt instruments where interest is based upon the prime rate and or libor and  therefore  future operations could be affected by interest rate changes  however  the company believes that the market risk of the debt is minimal
