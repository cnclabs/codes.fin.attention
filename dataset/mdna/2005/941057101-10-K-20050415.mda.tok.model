item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and and notes thereto included in this report 
overview we are a regional  vertically integrated provider of solid waste services 
we were founded by the chairman of the board of directors in we operate primarily in north carolina  south carolina  virginia  mississippi  tennessee  georgia and florida  providing solid waste collection  transfer  recycling  processing and disposal services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
at december   we operated collection operations  transfer stations  approximately county convenience drop off centers  recycling facilities and landfills in the southeastern us we had revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december   and revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december  percentages of our total revenue attributable to services provided are as follows year ended december  collection residential commercial industrial disposal and transfer recycling service recycled commodity sales other total service revenue from through december   we acquired  either by merger or asset purchase  solid waste collection or disposal operations  with nine being acquired in  six being acquired in and eight being acquired in eighty of these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition and have affected period to period comparisons of our operating results 
during the year ended december   we did not have any significant acquisitions requiring the presentation of the target s historical or the combined company s pro forma financial statements 
we anticipate that a significant part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  therefore  we expect that additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
current levels of population growth and economic development in the southeastern us and our strong market presence in the region should provide an opportunity to increase our revenues and market share 
as we add customers in existing markets  our density should improve  which we expect will increase our collection efficiencies and profitability 
executive summary in we continued to focus on initiatives for achieving positive results and improving our performance 
they are strengthening our competitive position in desired markets  internalizing more of our waste volume  
table of contents increasing revenues from our landfill operations  and employing best practices to deliver exceptional service 
our performance for was impacted by the business climate we operate within  which saw improving  but still relatively soft economic conditions in many of the secondary markets we serve  increased service delivery costs due to higher fuel prices  increased disposal fees and higher labor costs  and intense competitive pressures on pricing 
despite these challenges  our revenues increased  our workforce headcount declined  and our revenues per man hour improved by nearly 
in addition  our fleet count was reduced by  achievable primarily through ongoing rerouting of commercial and residential routes 
these statistics indicate that we have continued to look for and find ways to improve our efficiency and productivity 
we implemented a pricing strategy to adjust pricing on accounts that were not meeting standards and in some cases we chose to give up accounts that refused reasonable price increases 
this pricing strategy resulted in pricing growth for each quarter of internal volume growth was a positive for the total year 
this growth was primarily the result of higher seasonal industrial volume  increased landfill tonnage  and strong national accounts growth for the year 
net pricing growth was for the year 
fuel surcharges and recycled commodities sales contributed additional growth of and  respectively 
acquisition growth was during in which we completed nine acquisitions and exited two markets  representing net annualized acquired revenues of million 
we strive to be number one or number two in our markets and if this is not achievable in the near future  our strategy is to eventually exit those markets 
all acquisitions in were tuck ins and a continuation of our acquisition plan to expand in selected markets in order to achieve better route density and leverage our overhead cost structure 
we have experienced  as have others in this industry sector  increased operating costs which include higher fuel costs  and third party disposal  landfill and transfer fees 
these increases have affected our profit margin and bottom line 
to achieve our goals  we will continue to use route optimization tools such as route smart and route balance to focus on route productivity and optimization 
in addition  we have increased employee training and centered our efforts on fleet maintenance  data management  and customer pricing 
in  we believe these efforts will better position our company as the economy continues its recovery 
our capital expenditures of approximately million increased by million over the prior year due primarily to development efforts for our black bear municipal solid waste landfill site in camden county  north carolina 
if it becomes operational  the site will allow us to internalize some of the waste from our hauling companies in eastern north carolina and the tidewater area of virginia 
despite higher capital spending and increased dividend payments  our debt to total capitalization ratio of at december  was lower than the prior year ratio of 
we believe our million revolving credit facility  which matures in february  provides sufficient capital in combination with our cash flow from operating activities to fund our near term growth strategy and capital expenditures 
finally  as a result of our positive cash flow  our board of directors declared an per share semi annual dividend that was paid in june and december of general our branch waste collection operations generate revenues from fees collected from commercial  industrial and residential collection and transfer station customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial and industrial services that are performed under one year to five year service agreements 
our residential collection services are performed either on a subscription basis with individual households  or under contracts with municipalities  apartment owners  homeowners associations or mobile home park operators 
residential customers on a subscription basis are billed quarterly in advance and provide us with a stable source of revenues 
a liability for future service is recorded upon billing and revenues are recognized at the end of each month in which services are actually provided 
municipal contracts in our existing markets are typically awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and thereafter on a bid or negotiated basis and usually range in duration from one to five years 
municipal contracts provide consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
our prices for our solid waste services are typically determined by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged in our markets for similar services 

table of contents our ability to pass on cost increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a predetermined published price index  for automatic adjustment of fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
at december   we operated approximately convenience sites under contract with counties in order to consolidate waste in rural areas 
these contracts  which are usually competitively bid  generally have terms of one to five years and provide consistent cash flow during the term of the contract since we are paid regularly by the local government 
at december   we also operated recycling processing facilities as part of our collection and transfer operations where we collect  process  sort and recycle paper products  aluminum and steel cans  pallets  plastics  glass and other items 
our recycling facilities generate revenues from the collection  processing and resale of recycled commodities  particularly recycled wastepaper 
through a centralized effort  we resell recycled commodities using commercially reasonable practices and seek to manage commodity pricing risk by spreading the risk among our customers 
we also operate curbside residential recycling programs in connection with our residential collection operations in most of the communities we serve 
operating expenses for our collection operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to landfills 
at december   we operated or transferred from transfer stations that reduce our costs by improving our utilization of collection personnel and equipment and by consolidating the waste stream to gain more favorable disposal rates 
at december   we owned or operated landfills 
operating expenses for these landfill operations include labor  equipment  legal and administrative  ongoing environmental compliance  host community fees  site maintenance and accruals for closure and post closure maintenance 
cost of equipment sales primarily consists of our cost to purchase the disposal compactors and containers that we resell 
we capitalize certain expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects that meet stringent capitalization criteria 
indirect acquisition and project development costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
our policy is to charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion thereof that we estimate to be recoverable  through sale or otherwise relating to any operation that is permanently shut down  any acquisition that is not consummated and any landfill development project that is not expected to be successfully completed 
engineering  legal  permitting  construction and other costs directly associated with the acquisition or development of a landfill  together with associated interest  are capitalized 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative overhead  professional services  costs associated with our marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method 
other income has not historically been material to our results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the future allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon historical collection trends  type of customer  such as municipal or non municipal  the age of the outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
one customer  solid waste management authority of crisp county  represented approximately million of the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more discussion regarding the authority 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
self insurance reserves we assume the risks for medical and dental insurance exposures up to certain loss thresholds set forth in separate insurance contracts 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from third party experts 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 
adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded approximately million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share  in the first quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the effect of applying the provisions of sfas no 
was a reduction in income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  of approximately million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
effective january   our method of accounting for landfill closure and post closure  as well as landfill final capping  changed as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
sfas no 
does not change the basic landfill accounting that we and others in the industry have followed historically 
through december   the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed 
for further explanation  see note a brief explanation of final capping  closure and post closure is as follows final capping costs we are required to estimate the cost of each final capping event which involves covering the landfill with a flexible membrane and geosynthetic clay liner  compacted soil layers and topsoil and provide drainage for the areas of the landfill where total airspace capacity has been consumed 
the estimates also consider when these costs would be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
for each final capping event we quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs and amortize it over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed at the landfill 
closure and post closure costs closure costs include the last final capping event  the construction of the methane gas collection system  demobilization and routine maintenance costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
post closure activities  which include final landfill retirement activities once regulatory requirements are met  consist of routine maintenance of the landfill after it has closed  monitoring the ground and surface water  gas emissions and air quality 
estimates for future closure and post closure costs are based on costs that would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changes to legal and regulatory requirements makes our estimates and assumptions uncertain 
we amortize landfill retirement costs arising from closure and post closure obligations using our historical landfill accounting practices 
we amortize landfill retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption basis over the number of tons of waste that each final capping event covers 
we perform engineering studies using third party experts at least annually to estimate our remaining airspace capacity 

table of contents landfill accounting we have material financial commitments for final capping  closure and post closure obligations with respect to our landfills 
we develop our estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations using input from our third party engineers and internal accounting 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value 
absent quoted market prices  the estimate of fair value should be based on the best available information  including the results of present value techniques in accordance with statement of financial accounting concepts  or sfac  no 
 using cash flow and present value in accounting measurements 
in general  we rely on third parties to fulfill most of our obligations for final capping  closure and post closure 
accordingly  the fair market value of these obligations is based upon quoted and actual prices paid for similar work 
we intend to perform some of these capping  closure and post closure obligations using internal resources 
where internal resources are expected to be used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation  we have added a profit margin onto the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their fair market value as required by sfas no 
when we then perform these services internally  the added profit margin is recognized as a component of operating income in the period earned 
sfac no 
further states that an estimate of fair value should include the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for bearing the uncertainties in cash flows 
however  when utilizing discounted cash flow techniques  reliable estimates of market premiums may not be obtainable 
in this situation  sfac no 
indicates that it is not necessary to consider a market risk premium in the determination of expected cash flows 
in the waste industry  there is not an active market that can be utilized to determine the fair value of these activities as there is no market that exists for selling the responsibility for final capping  closure and post closure obligations independent of selling the landfill in its entirety 
accordingly  we believe that it is not possible to develop a methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium and have excluded a market risk premium from our determination of expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfac no 
once we have determined the estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations  we then inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value 
we are currently inflating these costs in current dollars until expected time of payment using an inflation rate of and are discounting these costs to present value using a credit adjusted  risk free discount rate of 
the credit adjusted  risk free rate is based on the risk free interest rate adjusted for our credit standing 
management reviews these estimates at least once per year 
significant changes in future final capping  closure and post closure cost estimates and inflation rates typically result in both a current adjustment to the recorded liability and corresponding adjustment to the landfill asset  based on the landfill s capacity that has been consumed  and a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
any change related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill asset is then recognized in amortization expense prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
changes in our credit adjusted  risk free rate do not change recorded liabilities  but subsequently recognized obligations are measured using the revised credit adjusted risk free rate 
we record the estimated fair value of final capping  closure and post closure obligations for our landfills based on the landfills capacity that has been consumed through the current period 
this liability and corresponding asset is accrued on a per ton basis 
the estimated fair value of each final capping event will be fully accrued when the tons associated with such capping event have been disposed in the landfill 
additionally  the estimated fair value of total final capping  closure and post closure costs will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
closure and post closure accruals consider estimates for methane gas control  leachate management and ground water monitoring and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after the site discontinues accepting waste  which is generally expected to be for a period of up to years after final site closure 
daily maintenance activities  which include many of these costs  are incurred during the operating life of the landfill and are expensed as incurred 
daily maintenance activities include leachate disposal  surface water  groundwater  and methane gas monitoring and maintenance  other pollution control activities  mowing and fertilizing the landfill cap  fence and road maintenance  and third party inspection and reporting costs 
for purchased disposal sites  we assess and record present value based final capping  closure and post closure obligations at the time we assume such responsibilities 
such liabilities are based on the estimated final capping  closure and post closure costs and the percentage of airspace consumed related to such obligations as of the date we assumed the responsibility 
thereafter  we account for the landfill and related final capping  closure and post closure obligations consistent with the policy described above 
interest accretion on final capping  closure and post closure obligations is recorded using the effective interest method and is recorded as final capping  closure and post closure expense  which is included in operating costs on the income statement 
in the united states  the closure and post closure obligations are established by the environmental protection agency s subtitles c and d regulations  as implemented and applied on a state by state basis 
the costs to comply with these obligations could increase in the future as a result of legislation or regulation 
we routinely review our investment in operating landfills to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational 
table of contents performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
while the precise amounts of these future obligations cannot be determined  at december   we estimate total landfill closure and post closure costs of approximately million for the airspace consumed to date 
our estimate of these costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
we had accrued approximately million for such projected costs as of december  and subsequently paid approximately million in we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
derivative financial instruments we utilize cash flow hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to fluctuation in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
the fair values of all derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction 
our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  criteria must be met  including a requirement that both at inception of the hedge  and on an ongoing basis  the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting  and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recognized in earnings 
allocation of acquisition purchase price acquisition purchase price is allocated to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
independent specialists are utilized to assist management in the determination of fair values of tangible and intangible assets 
we accrue the payment of contingent purchase price if the events surrounding the contingency are deemed assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
the purchase price allocations are considered preliminary until we are no longer waiting for information that we have arranged to obtain and that is known to be available or obtainable 
although the time required to obtain the necessary information will vary with circumstances specific to an individual acquisition  the allocation period for finalizing purchase price allocations generally does not exceed one year from the consummation of a business combination 
we often consummate single acquisitions of solid waste collection or disposal operations 
for each separately identified solid waste collection or disposal operation acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation based on our relative fair value 
following this initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each solid waste collection or disposal operation based on our estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs  as discussed above 
from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either remitted or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
in  we completed an exchange transaction in which we acquired operations of another solid waste company in georgia for operations in tennessee and mississippi  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we discontinued amortization of goodwill effective january  on an ongoing basis  we perform an annual impairment test 
at least quarterly  we analyze whether an event has occurred that would more likely than not reduce its enterprise fair value below its carrying amount and  if necessary  will perform a goodwill impairment test between annual dates 
impairment adjustment after adoption  if any  will be recognized as an operating expense 
we adopted july as our annual assessment date 
we completed our annual impairment test july  and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 

table of contents long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment on a market by market basis whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the projected future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis attributable to each market would be compared to the carrying value of the long lived assets including an allocation of goodwill  if appropriate of that market 
if an impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the fair value of the asset 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of such lives 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

net income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the changes explained above  most notably  million higher gains on disposal of operations  increased sales revenue  and a lower effective tax rate 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable primarily to the effect of six businesses acquired during the year ended december  and eight businesses and contracts acquired during the year ended december   offset by the disposition of four businesses resulting in a net increase of million 
also contributing to the increase in revenues were an increase of approximately million in industrial revenue  an increase of approximately million in residential service revenue  an increase of approximately million in landfill  disposal and special waste revenue  and an increase in annexation fees  fuel surcharges and other miscellaneous revenue of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately million in transfer station revenue due to the loss of a municipal contract  compared to the same period in our revenue growth of was comprised of of acquisition growth and of internal growth

an additional million of increased amortization was due to higher disposal volume 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effective january   landfill assets are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense as airspace is consumed over the life of the specific final capping event or the life of the landfill for closure and post closure 
gain on sale of collection and hauling operations 
we recognized a gain on sale of collection and hauling operations totaling approximately  and a loss of approximately  at december  and  respectively 
these sales were a divestiture of assets in certain markets that did not meet our profitability goals 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and interest rates during the majority of  compared to debt increased in the third quarter of by million due to acquisition activity and landfill expansion in the third and fourth quarters of interest expense includes amortization of deferred financing costs

net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to increased cost of operations  sg a costs  depreciation and amortization expense and a charge for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which offset our total revenue growth 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was a negative million and a negative million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital has been to apply the cash generated from operations that remains available after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
we generally finance our working capital requirements from internally generated funds and bank borrowings 
in addition to internally generated funds  we have in place financing arrangements to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs in prior to  we had fully drawn our three million term loan facilities with prudential insurance company of america 
in  we began principal repayments on the first million term facility 
the prudential facilities require us to maintain financial ratios  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
interest on the three prudential facilities is paid quarterly  based on fixed rates for the three facilities of  and  respectively  and the facilities mature as follows million in april  million in june and million in february on august   we amended and extended our revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lending institutions for which fleet national bank acts as agent 
this fleet credit facility provides up to million through february virtually all of our assets  and those of our subsidiaries  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the fleet credit facility 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement with fleet  prudential shares in the collateral pledged under the fleet credit facility 
in addition  our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the prudential term loan facilities 
the fleet credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either a fleet base rate or at the eurodollar rate based on eurodollar interbank market rates plus  in each case  a percentage rate that fluctuates  based on the ratio of our funded debt to ebitda income before income taxes plus interest expense and depreciation and amortization  from to for base rate borrowings and to for euro rate borrowings 
the fleet credit facility requires us to maintain financial ratios and satisfy other requirements  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
it also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in some circumstances 
as of december   million was outstanding under the fleet credit facility  and the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was approximately 
availability under the facility was approximately million as of december  on september   we entered into a million income tax exempt variable rate bond with sampson county  north carolina for the funding of expansion at our landfill in that county 
this bond was in addition to our existing million sampson bond 
both bonds are backed by a letter of credit issued by wachovia bank trust as a participating lender under our fleet syndication 
the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under both sampson bonds was approximately at december  
table of contents as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years long term debt expected landfill liabilities disposal agreements capital expenditures operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations includes amounts outstanding as of december  of million under our fleet credit facility  million under the prudential term facilities  and million under the sampson bond facilities 
our fleet credit facility allows us to borrow up to million provided we are in compliance with loan covenants 
availability under the fleet facility was approximately million at december  as disclosed in note of our financial statements  we have entered into various interest rate swaps which fixed the interest rate for a portion of our debt through additionally  we have entered into commodity swap contracts to hedge our recycling revenue received for old corrugated cardboard 
the commodity swap contracts have a year term 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was an asset of approximately million 
the fair value of the commodity swap contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a liability of approximately million 
landfill liabilities are based on current costs and include capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
these costs represent the total expected landfill liabilities we will incur over the life of our landfills 
we recognize these liabilities as airspace which is consumed in each landfill 
the company uses financial surety bonds for a variety of corporate guarantees 
the two largest uses of financial surety bonds are for municipal contract performance guarantees and landfill closure and post closure financial assurance required under certain environmental regulations 
environmental regulations require demonstrated financial assurance to meet closure and post closure requirements for landfills 
in addition to surety bonds  these requirements may also be met through alternative financial assurance instruments  including insurance and letters of credit 
amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year to years over years standby letters of credit performance bonds total commercial commitments 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of net income of million plus non cash adjustments eg depreciation and amortization  etc 
of million and net changes in assets liabilities of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions  offset by provided from the sale of collection and hauling operations  million was used for acquisition related liabilities and million was used for capital expenditures  of which million was for landfill expansion  with the balance primarily for investments in equipment  consisting primarily of trucks and containers 
cash inflows from investing activities included million received from the sale of property and equipment 
capital expenditures were million for compared to million in we expect to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds and borrowings under existing credit facilities 
as an owner and potential acquirer of additional new landfill disposal facilities  we might also be required to make significant expenditures to bring newly acquired disposal facilities into compliance with regulatory requirements 
we might also be required to make significant expenditures to obtain permits for newly acquired disposal facilities or expand the available disposal capacity at any newly acquired disposal facilities 
the amount of these expenditures cannot be currently determined because they will depend on the nature and extent of any acquired landfill disposal facilities  the condition of any facilities acquired and the permitting status of any acquired sites 
we expect we would fund any capital expenditures to acquire solid waste collection and disposal businesses and any regulatory expenses for newly acquired disposal facilities through borrowings under our existing credit facilities to the extent we could not fund such acquisitions with our common stock 
we have financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs  or long term care of disposal facilities that we operate or for which we are or might become responsible 
landfill closure and post closure costs include estimated costs to be incurred for final closure of landfills and estimated costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills 
we estimate these future cost requirements based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the epa s subtitle d regulations 
our estimate of capping  final closure of our operating facilities  and post closure monitoring costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the total costs for capping  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs  there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million  which primarily included net repayments of long term debt including capital leases of million and dividends paid of million 
at december   we had approximately million of long term and short term borrowings outstanding including capital leases and approximately million in letters of credit including performance bonds 
the ratio of our total debt including capital leases to total capitalization was at december   compared to as of december  off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
newly adopted accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the application of sfas no 
reduced income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  by approximately million  net of income tax benefit  or per diluted share 
substantially all of this charge was related to changes in accounting for landfill final capping  closure and post closure costs 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was subsequently amended in december by fin r 
fin as amended by fin r  requires 
table of contents that unconsolidated variable interest entities be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries 
a primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual benefits 
fin as amended by fin r  applies to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing variable interest entities beginning after june  we fully adopted fin as amended by fin r  on march  and this adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments 
sfas r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in their statements of operations for all share based payments eg  stock options and restricted stock granted to employees based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the cost of the employee services is recognized as compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted 
the pronouncement must be adopted by july  we expect to adopt the pronouncement on july  as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to our employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash flows or financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share included within note to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued eitf issue  applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations 
the task force reached a consensus that classification of a disposed component as a discontinued operation is appropriate only if the ongoing entity has no continuing direct cash flows and further clarifies what constitutes a direct cash flow  and does not retain an interest  contract  or other arrangement sufficient to enable it to exert significant influence over the disposed component s operating and financial policies after the disposal transaction 
issue will be applied by the company to components that are disposed of or classified as held for sale in periods beginning after december   as required 
this statement  upon adoption  will have an impact on the presentation of the company s business dispositions in future years 
in and  exchanges of assets were not required to be shown as discontinued operations  based on the company s interpretation of sfas no 
risk factors as previously mentioned in our note relating to forward looking statements  there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our business 
we have included a brief discussion of some of these types of risks below competition we encounter intense competition from governmental  quasi governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations 
the waste industry currently consists of large national waste management companies  and local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources 
we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 
these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues and tax exempt financing are available to them 
also  such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage 
in addition  competitors may reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively bid contracts 
when this happens  we may rollback prices or offer lower pricing to attract or retain our customers  resulting in a negative impact to our yield on base business 

table of contents acquisitions our growth strategy includes expanding through acquisitions  acquiring additional exclusive arrangements and generating internal growth 
most of our growth has been through acquisitions 
although we have identified numerous acquisition candidates that we believe are suitable  we may not be able to acquire them at prices or on terms and conditions favorable to us 
our ability to grow also depends on several other factors  including the availability of capital to support our growth  our ability to compete with existing and emerging companies  our ability to maintain profit margins in the face of competitive pressures  our ability to continue to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  and continued strong demand for our services 
difficulties in any of these areas could hinder our growth 
economic conditions us economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 
our business is affected by general economic conditions 
weakness in the us economy has a negative effect on our operating results  including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows 
additionally  in a down cycle economic environment  we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover 
if economic conditions deteriorate  we will experience pressure on the pricing that we are able to achieve for our services 
in addition  worsening economic conditions may lead to further negative effects of customer turnover 
there can be no assurance that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  there can be no assurance that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate  if at all  positive improvement in our operating results 
fuel the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable  and can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances  as well as other events outside our control  such as actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
we need fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and equipment used in our landfill operations  and price escalations or reductions in the supply will likely increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on income from operations and cash flows 
we have in place a fuel surcharge program  designed to offset increased fuel expenses  however  we are not able to pass through all of the increased costs and some customers contracts prohibit any pass through of the increased costs 
additionally  as fuel prices increase  many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs 
regulation we are subject to costly environmental regulations and environmental litigation 
our equipment  facilities  and operations are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety 
these include  among other things  laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
our compliance with these regulatory requirements is costly 
government laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines  implement corrective measures or may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked 
we are  and also may be in the future  defendants in lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and surrounding 
table of contents landowners who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury  property damage and or violations of permits and licenses by us 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
certain of our waste disposal operations traverse state and county boundaries 
in the future  our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by proposed federal legislation that authorizes the states to enact legislation governing interstate shipments of waste 
such proposed federal legislation may allow individual states to prohibit the disposal of out of state waste or to limit the amount of out of state waste that could be imported for disposal and may require states  under some circumstances  to reduce the amount of waste exported to other states 
if this or similar legislation is enacted in states in which we operate landfills that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out of state  our operations could be negatively affected 
we believe that several states have proposed or have considered adopting legislation that would regulate the interstate transportation and disposal of waste in the states landfills 
our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by flow control legislation which may be proposed in the united states congress 
this proposed federal legislation may allow states and local governments to direct waste generated within their jurisdictions to a specific facility for disposal or processing 
if this or similar legislation is enacted  state or local governments with jurisdiction over our landfills could act to limit or prohibit disposal or processing of waste in our landfills 
weather our collection and landfill operations could be adversely affected by long periods of inclement weather which interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity and or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  certain of our operations may be temporarily suspended as a result of particularly harsh weather conditions 
severe weather can negatively affect the costs of collection and disposal 
long periods of inclement weather could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
seasonality our results of operations tend to vary seasonally  with the first quarter typically generating the least amount of revenues  higher revenues in the second and third quarters  and a decline in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the fall and winter months primarily due to lower construction activities 
also  certain operating and selling  general  and administrative costs remain relatively constant throughout the calendar year  which  when offset by these revenues  results in a similar seasonality of operating income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk quantitative disclosures 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective january  to modify the interest characteristics of our outstanding long term debt and have designated the qualifying instrument as a cash flow hedge 
under the terms of the agreement  the interest rate swap has a notional value of million with a fixed rate of 
the agreement expired november in march  we entered into additional interest rate swaps to hedge notional debt values of million and million  respectively 
these swaps are effective for the period of november through february with fixed rates of 
our results of operations are impacted by fluctuations in commodity pricing 
to reduce our risk to market fluctuations  we entered into two commodity swap contracts effective january  and june   respectively  to hedge our recycling revenue received for old corrugated cardboard occ  the pricing of which was volatile in and  and have designated the qualifying instruments as cash flow hedges 
the contracts each hedge  tons of occ at a ton for a term of three years 
in november  we entered into a contract effective january   to hedge another  tons of occ at a ton for a term of three years 
the notional amounts hedged under these agreements represent approximately of our current occ volume 
we have used heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuation in diesel fuel oil prices 
to date  such agreements have not been significant to our financial condition and results of operations 
on december   we entered into a heating oil hedge contract  effective january   to cap our exposure on million gallons of diesel fuel at per gallon 
the hedge coverage represents approximately of our first quarter diesel fuel requirements  and expires on march  our market risk exposure has not changed materially during the months ended december  
table of contents the following table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of our long term debt at december  by expected maturity dates 
fair values have been determined based on our incremental borrowing rate as of december  thereafter total carrying value total fair value in thousands fixed rate variable rate qualitative disclosures 
our primary exposure relates to interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on outstanding long term and short term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
