table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview numerex corp 
is a technology company comprised of operating subsidiaries that develop and market a wide range of communications products and services 
our primary focus is wireless data communications utilizing proprietary network technologies 
the year marked a milestone year for numerex in which our products and services gained significant traction and heightened visibility 
we continued the development of our network strategy to support continued expansive coverage  legacy network interoperability and expanded digital capabilities for higher bandwidth applications 
for example  we announced a joint development agreement to deliver multi mode digital radios with new features that increase our network and solution capabilities as well as provide a technology migration path for analog only customers 
excluding the impact of data source llc  which was sold in september of  total revenues in grew to million  a million increase compared to wireless data revenues contributed over of this growth  increasing over million compared to the prior year 
most of this growth came from service revenues which are not only recurring in nature but are also profitable 
digital multimedia also grew in compared to as a result of both increased shipments of video conferencing equipment and stronger integration and installation service revenues 
gross margins slightly declined in compared to the prior year  however  again excluding the impact of datasource  gross margins grew in all segments of the business  particularly in wireless data where there was an increase in recurring service revenues 
overheads  which include both sg a as well as r d  increased nominally in compared to the prior year 
this increase occurred in the first part of prior to the distribution agreement with south west dealer services  by virtue of which they now assume the sales costs of selling directly to auto dealerships 
as a result of these many improvements  numerex recorded significantly reduced operating losses in compared to numerex has a stronger cash position at the end of than it had a year ago 
at the end of our cash balance was more than twice the cash balance compared to the end of current assets now exceed current liabilities 
in  we generated cash flows from operating activities of over million compared to an operating account deficit in in addition  our financial position was further strengthened at the end of january with the sale of a million convertible term note to the laurus master fund  ltd 
the net proceeds from the financing will be used primarily to provide additional working capital 
the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the fiscal years ended december  and and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of numerex s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories and the adequacy of reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  accounting for income taxes and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we primarily sell products  recurring services most billed on a monthly basis and on demand services 
product revenues are recognized at the time title passes to the customer  which in most cases is at the time of shipment 
however  we did have one significant product shipment in where we did not recognize revenue at the passage of title 
in may  we shipped  of wire line security detection equipment to a customer in australia 
this equipment has been installed at several sites based on an equipment supply agreement the agreement with this customer 
the agreement allows the customer to generate additional revenues by providing additional services to its customers 
we will share in these revenues as payment for the equipment 
while this customer retains title to this equipment from acceptance which occurred may  it must meet certain obligations under the agreement or pay amounts specified in the agreement 
since the actual revenue that will be generated by the sale of the equipment is uncertain at this time  we are recognizing revenue on the sale of the equipment equal to the payments received from this customer from this revenue share 
we also recognized cost of sales equal to the payments received from the customer and reduced the value of this asset 
while we only received our first payment from this customer in september  we and our customer in australia continue to promote the new service now that the installation has been completed and tested 
currently we expect to receive at least the full value of the equipment from this revenue share  however  as more information becomes available  we will reassess the accounting treatment for the project 
in may  the value of the wire line equipment was transferred from inventory to other assets 
we bill most of our recurring service revenues on a monthly basis  which are generated by providing customers access to our wireless machine to machine communications network the network 
we sell these services to retailers and wholesalers of the service 
for services sold to retailers  monthly service fees are generally a fixed monthly amount billed one month in advance 
we defer the advance billing for the service and recognize the revenue when the services are provided 
for services sold to wholesalers  the customers are billed a fixed base fee in advance and usage fees in arrears at the end of each month 
again  we defer the advance billing of the base fee and recognize the revenues when the services are performed 
we also provide services on a demand basis such as installation services 
these types of services are generally completed in a short period of time usually less than one month and are billed and the revenue recognized when the services are completed 
we do occasionally have multiple element service agreements  which involve both the supply of product and the provision of services over a multi year arrangement 
accounting principles for agreements involving multiple elements require us to allocate earned revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
the arrangement fee for multiple element arrangements is allocated to each element  such as design  product supply  product integration  installation  maintenance  support and warranty services  based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in multi element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately or could be purchased from an unrelated supplier 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the fair value method 
under these methods  the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contract term on an as earned basis 
in the case of the supply of product we maintain title to the product and transfer title at the completion of the contract term 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is estimated based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where information exists that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  we establish a general reserve for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change  ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
inventories and reserves for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventory and identify  with estimates  potential future excess  obsolete and slow moving inventories 
we specifically identify obsolete products for reserve purposes and analyze historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends  and historical write offs when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and slow moving inventory 
if we are not able to achieve our expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current carrying value  we would adjust our reserves accordingly 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when determined that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net goodwill and intangible assets amounted to  as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize  of goodwill 
on march  we purchased the share cingular owned in cellemetry llc 
this gave us ownership of cellemetry llc and increased total goodwill to  at december  we had recorded  of amortization during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during and approximately  in in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
based on this initial review at january  and the annual review at december   and  we did not record an impairment charge 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments at the time of issuance 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
the effect of the standard will be to require entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock awards based on its grant date fair value and to recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide services for the award 
we expect to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective july   as required  and plan to use the modified prospective transition method for our existing stock based compensation plans 
under the modified prospective transition method  the fair value based accounting method will be used for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the adoption date 
compensation cost related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of that date will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no 
under this method  it is estimated that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in approximately  of stock based compensation expense in the second half of related to non vested employee options issued prior to the adoption date 
in november  the fasb released revised sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

the new standard requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the requirements of the standard will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  although we are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements  we currently do not believe it will have a material impact as we have not historically had any abnormally low levels of production  unplanned downtime  labor or material shortages 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

table of contents result of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain revenue and expense items and the percentage increases and decreases for those items in the company s consolidated statements of operations

most of the product and service sales increase for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was in digital multimedia and networking and wireless data communications in the amount of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in wireline security product and service sales of cost of product sales increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of higher product sales volume in the wireless data communications and digital multimedia networking  which were partially offset by lower wireline product sales 
we also experienced an increase in the cost of our wireless services products during the year ended december  versus the same periods in we have identified alternative sources of these products that we 
table of contents believe should defray some of these increases in future periods 
cost of services increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of services for the twelve months ended december  versus the same period in was primarily the result of higher service sales volume in wireless data communications and higher service sales volume in digital multimedia and networking 
additionally  we received a one time credit against network service provider costs that occurred in quarter ended june  that did not occur in cost of sales depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the sale of the assets relating to datasource  which was sold in september gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the total gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same period in because product sales were of total sales for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  since  gross profit as a percentage of sales is generally less on product sales than for service sales  the increase in product sales versus service sales decreased the total gross profit as a percentage of sales 
the decreases in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the twelve months period ended december  versus the same period in were partially offset by a reduction of depreciation expense due to the sale of the assets relating of datasource 
selling  general  administrative and other expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  selling  general  administrative and other expenses decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  selling  general  administrative and other expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue for the year primarily due to reductions in personnel in our mobile guardian division 
research and development expenses remained constant at  for the year ended december  we expense research and development costs and expect such costs to continue at current levels 
bad debt expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  bad debt decreased during the period as a result of the implementation of more stringent credit policies and collections processes as well as an improvement in general economic conditions 
operating expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this was due to some older assets becoming fully depreciated while we have had a limited requirement for the purchase of new equipment 
interest expense net increased to  in compared to  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of interest expense on the  we received from a convertible note payable to laurus master fund on january  this convertible note payable replaced the  note payable to cingular 
the note payable to laurus master fund has a higher effective interest rate than the cingular note payable  however  the laurus note payable has a longer term 
we issued the note payable to cingular on march   thus the twelve month period ended december  had approximately nine months of interest expense  while the laurus master fund note payable was issued by us on january   therefore  the twelve month period ended december  had approximately eleven and a half months of interest expense 
gain on the sale of business of  for the twelve month period ended december  was due to the receipt of a contingent payment in march on the sale of datasource in september since the contingency was favorably met 
the gain on the sale of business of  twelve month period ended december  was attributable to the sale of datasource 
foreign currency loss of  for the year ended december  versus a gain of  was mostly the result of foreign currency loses on sales to canadian customers 
more likely than not  we will not utilize the deferred tax items so we have not recorded a federal tax benefit for the year ended december  the  for the twelve month period ended december  is related to certain state and foreign income taxes 
the  in income tax expense for the twelve month period ended december  is related to our operations in australia and certain state income taxes 
we recorded a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  basic and diluted loss per common share increased to for year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   which includes the gain on the sale of datasource 

table of contents the weighted average and diluted shares outstanding decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in weighted average basic shares outstanding for the twelve month period ended was primarily due to our repurchase on march  of  shares of our common stock held by cingular 
this was partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease in sales was due to a decrease in digital multimedia  networking sales and in wireless data communication 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in wireless data communication services revenues and an increase in wireline security sales 
as a percentage of total net sales  services revenues of the company increased to for the year ended december  which comprised of a increase in wireless data communication service revenues partially offset by decrease in digital multimedia and networking services of 
cost of product sales decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the lower volume of product sales in wireless data communications and digital multimedia and networking 
cost of services increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increased service revenue volume in wireless data communications 
cost of sales depreciation and amortization expense increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the purchase of software and hardware for the datasource service line that was sold on september   the capitalization of software developed internally in both and and the purchase of a license agreement in for our wireline business in australia 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the reason for the increase in the gross profit for the year was primarily attributable to service revenues being a higher portion of total revenues in versus service revenues were of total revenues in versus for and we generally achieve higher margin than product sales 
service revenues were also up in total  which allowed us to make up some of the gross profit dollars lost from the decline in product sales 
the sale of a gateway software license recorded in the second quarter of had a significant positive impact on margin percentage for the year ended in december   since this software was originally developed for cellemetry s internal use  there was little additional costs associated with this sale to an external customer 
this added approximately to the margin percentage for the twelve month period ended december  did not include such a gateway software license sale  thus the margin did not receive such a benefit 
selling  general  administrative and other expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  selling  general  administrative and other expenses decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  selling  general  administrative and other expenses decreased primarily due to reductions in personnel 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this was primarily the result of reductions in research and development personnel that was partially offset by lower capitalization than in the prior year 
most of the research and development was more general in  as opposed to the major projects in we expense research and development costs and expect it to continue at current levels 
bad debt expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  bad debt expense was unusually high in due to an increase in customers not being able to pay as a result of a decline in the general economic conditions in the telecommunications industry and severely curtailed access to additional sources of capital and credit facilities 
this led us to tighten our credit policy beginning in the latter part of the  bad debt expense in included  written off for a specific customer 
we accepted product in lieu of payment for the goods and services billed to the customer 
the sales value of the goods and services sold to this customer totaled   was invoiced in the forth quarter ended december  and the balance of  was invoiced in the first quarter of the  written off to bad debt expense represents the margin earned on the sale 
the balance   represented the expected net realizable value in this case at cost of the product repossessed and placed in inventory 
operating expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this was due to some older assets becoming fully depreciated while we had a limited requirement for the purchase of new equipment 

table of contents costs related to non recurring acquisition activity were  for the year ended december  this write off was the result of us reaching an impasse in the second quarter of in its negotiations with bt group plc to acquire their redcare division  its security products and service business 
these costs were primarily related to legal and accounting expenses incurred during diligence and negotiations 
interest expense net increased to  in compared to  for the prior year 
this increase in net interest expense was primarily the result of increased interest expense on the  note payable incurred on march  to cingular for the purchase of their interest in cellemetry see explanation under liquidity and capital resources 
there was also additional interest expense in the year ended december  versus the same period in on our revolving line of credit 
gain on sale of business of  for the year ended december  was due to the sale of our datasource mobile messaging service through an entity datasource llc 
the selling price was approximately  with  paid in cash at closing and  due in six months on march   if certain criteria are met 
currently it has not been determined if these criteria have been met 
costs associated with the transaction included the net book value of the assets sold  including software and computer hardware  and transaction costs including finders fees and legal costs 
while the sale of datasource llc did not meet the requirements to be considered a significant disposition  its sale will have a negative impact on future revenues  gross margins and cash flow because of the profitable nature of the business 
foreign currency gain of  for the year ended december  versus a loss of  was mostly the result of foreign currency gains on sales to canadian customers due to the weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
minority interest for the year ended december  was compared to  for the year ended december  the principle reason for the decrease in minority interest was the depletion of minority interest on the company s balance sheet related to a joint venture 
we purchased the minority parties interest on march  due to its net loss from operations  we did not record a federal tax provision in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  in income tax expense recorded for relates to our operations in australia and certain state income taxes 
we are entitled to the benefits of certain net operating loss carry forwards  however  net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and respectively may not be available in future years 
we have not classified our net operating loss carry forwards as an asset in our financial statements and thus a loss of net operating loss carry forwards does not impact current operating results 
we recorded a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  preferred stock dividend for the year ended december  was as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the conversion of the preferred stock to our common stock in december we recorded a net loss applicable to common shareholders of  for the year ended december  as compared to net loss applicable to common shareholders of  for the year ended december  basic and diluted loss per common share decreased to for year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the weighted average and diluted shares outstanding increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the conversion of preferred stock to  shares of our common stock in december  the exercise of stock options  and share issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
the  shares of common stock were repurchased on march  see explanation under liquidity and capital resources

the increase in wireless data communications product sales of  for the year ended december  versus the same period in was primarily the result of increased sales of its new wireless vending machine monitoring product vendview and an increase in vehicle security products and tracking services  mobileguardian the vendview product was only introduced in the fourth quarter of we expect vendview to continue to supplement the sales of our other wireless products 
product sales also increased due to higher demand for uplink security devices used for wireless communications between alarm installations and central monitoring stations 
the increase in the wireless data communication services was primarily due to an increase in the number of connections to our cellemetry wireless network 
these increases were achieved even though we sold our short messaging service datasource in september connection increases were generated by sales of our security products as well as those generated by value added resellers who utilize the cellemetry network to provide customer solutions 
we also anticipate that vendview will continue to add additional connections in subsequent periods 
we continue to focus on increasing connections to our network due to the recurring nature of service revenues 
net sales from digital multimedia and networking increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues compared to the was due to a increase in product revenues to  primarily due to increased sales of our interactive videoconferencing products powerplay directly or indirectly as a subcontractor to distance learning customers 

table of contents capital spending by targeted distance learning customers is largely funded by government entities and  as a result  is difficult to predict and can fluctuate significantly from period to period  however we continue to see signs of increased activity in this area 
digital multimedia and networking service sales increased to  for the year ended december  over the same period in most of this was from integration and installation services  which increased substantially compared to the same period in the prior year 
installation and integration services are primarily  either directly or indirectly  provided to large wireline and wireless telecommunication companies 
demand for these services from the wireline carriers has declined as they have reduced capital spending 
wireless carrier demand for these services can fluctuate dramatically in response to an environment of increasing customer demand for their services while at the same time they attempt to control their own capital expenditures 
there was a significant increase of installation and integration services by the wireless carriers in the second and third quarter of as a result of government mandated provision of emergency services by the end of this year 
while service revenues have increased for the year  we cannot predict whether telecommunications customers will maintain their current level of capital expenditures 
net sales from wireline security decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  most of the wireline product sales in were the sales of maintenance parts to a customer in australia with which we have an equipment supply agreement the agreement 
pursuant to the agreement  in may  we shipped  of wireline security detection equipment to the customer  in exchange for a share of the customer s future revenues 
although  under the agreement  the customer retains title to this equipment following its acceptance  it must meet certain obligations under the agreement  or pay amounts specified in the agreement 
since the actual revenue that will be generated by the sale of the equipment is uncertain at this time  we did not recognize revenue on the equipment sale as of december  during the twelve month period ended december  there were sales of maintenance parts to the customer that were not made pursuant to the agreement 
the sale price was fixed and payable in accordance with our normal terms and conditions 
accordingly  we recognized revenues from the sales of the maintenance parts to the customer in the twelve month period ended december  and the customer completed installation of the wireline security detection equipment in december currently  the customer and numerex are promoting the new expanded service 
we received our first share of revenues from the services in the third quarter of currently  we expect to receive at least the full value of the equipment from this revenue share  however  as more information becomes available  we will reassess the accounting treatment for the project 
in may  the value of the wire line equipment was transferred from inventory to other assets 
we expect to continue to sell maintenance parts and perform services for this customer for the term of the agreement 
fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales from wireless data communications decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  wireless data communications product sale decreased by  which was partially offset by an increase of service revenues of 
the decrease in product sales was primarily the result of changes made to our distribution strategy for wireless mobile telemetry product lines  which resulted in a decline in unit sales while new markets were developed during this included exiting the radio distribution market because of intense competition and slim margins as well as a revised focus with regard to mobile tracking 
with regard to mobile tracking we launched our mobileguardian product line  which provides vehicle security and tracking services  early in we continue to develop our automotive dealer distribution network for this product line and anticipate that the decline in product sales of mobile tracking units is temporary 
the increase in service revenues was primarily due to increased connections on our cellemetry network  mainly related to security monitoring 
the second quarter of net service revenues included a sale of a license of our cellemetry gateway software to a customer in colombia  south america for  excluding this sale  service revenue derived from connections to cellemetry network increased in versus the same period in in addition there was an increase in digital subscribers utilizing our datasource mobile messaging service prior to being sold on september  see comments on gain on sale of business 
net sales from digital multimedia and networking decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily in product sales in both digital multimedia and networking 
the decrease in digital multimedia product sales was largely due to a decrease in powerplay purchases by distance learning customers 
the decline in network monitoring equipment sales was due to a reduction in capital spending by telecommunications customers for the year ended december  versus the same period in the reduction in network monitoring equipment also translated into a decline in installation service revenues of 
while a reversal in the decline in capital spending for distance learning and telecommunications customers remains uncertain  we introduced ipcontact in december of this high performance desktop videoconferencing software package is expected to supplement powerplay sales in net sales from wireline security increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in product sales  which is due to additional sales of maintenance parts to a customer in australia with which we have an equipment supply agreement the agreement 
pursuant to the agreement  in may  the company shipped  of wireline security detection equipment to the customer  in exchange for a share of the customer s future revenues 
although the customer retains title to this equipment from acceptance  it must meet certain obligations under the agreement  or pay amounts specified in the 
table of contents agreement 
since the actual revenue that will be generated by the sale of the equipment is uncertain at this time  we did not recognize revenue on the equipment sale as of december  the sales of maintenance parts to the customer  however  was not pursuant to the agreement and therefore we recognized revenues from those sales in the period ended december  since the sales price was a fixed amount and payable upon our normal terms
