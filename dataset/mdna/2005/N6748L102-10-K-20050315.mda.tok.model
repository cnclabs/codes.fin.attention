item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations which are based upon the consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified orthopedic products company offering a broad line of minimally invasive surgical  as well as non surgical  products for the spine  reconstruction and trauma market sectors 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  non invasive stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  and bracing products used for ligament injury prevention  pain management and protection of surgical repair to promote faster healing 
our products also include a device for enhancing venous circulation  cold therapy  other pain management products  bone cement and devices for removal of the bone cement used to fix artificial implants  a bone substitute compound and airway management products 
we have administrative and training facilities in the united states  the united kingdom and italy and manufacturing facilities in the united states  the united kingdom  italy  mexico and the seychelles 
we directly distribute our products in the united states  the united kingdom  ireland  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  mexico  brazil and puerto rico 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the equity method of accounting is used when we have significant influence over significant operating decisions but do not hold control 
under the equity method  original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies 
all material intercompany transactions and profits associated with the equity investees are eliminated in consolidation 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of the shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar income and expenditures 
during the year  we have used derivative instruments to hedge interest rate fluctuation exposure 
we do not ordinarily use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange exposure 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we manage our operations as three business segments americas orthofix  americas breg  and international orthofix 
americas orthofix consists of the operations in the united states  existing prior to the acquisition of breg  as well as operations in mexico  brazil  and puerto rico 
americas breg consists of breg s domestic and independent international distributor operations 
international orthofix consists of operations  existing prior to the acquisition of breg  which are located in the rest of the world as well as independent export distribution operations 
group activities are comprised of the parent s operating expenses and identifiable assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and adjustments  inventories  investments  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions and believe our estimates for the carrying values of assets and liabilities are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition for bone growth stimulation and bracing products  prescribed by a physician  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on and accepted by the patient 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment unless contractual agreements specify fob destination 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues in the united states from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
some billings are subject to review by such third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves in excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory write down in the future may be necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  the ongoing impact was that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
as a result  we evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill under sfas the annual impairment test requires an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit  which involves judgment 
we performed the impairment test of goodwill as required by sfas no 
and noted no impairment issues with the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of december litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we and our operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations  and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety  employment and healthcare regulatory matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve substantial amounts of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and client base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions

orthopedic products are sold into three market sectors  spine  reconstruction and trauma 
sales of non orthopedic products include the laryngeal mask product  woman s care and other products 
market sector year ended december  in us thousands percent of percent of percent of total net total net total net net sales sales net sales sales net sales sales orthopedic spine    reconstruction    trauma    total orthopedic    non orthopedic    total    compared to sales by business segment net sales increased to million in  which included million of net sales attributable to americas breg  compared to million in the impact of foreign currency increased sales by million in when compared to net sales in americas orthofix the americas increased to million in compared to million in the americas net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the americas experienced growth in all market sectors  led by a increase in trauma products 
the following table illustrates sales by market sector in the americas in thousands net sales net sales growth orthopedic spine   reconstruction   trauma   total orthopedic   non orthopedic   americas orthofix   net sales in americas breg breg were million in which represented of total net sales in breg was acquired on december   therefore there are no sales for breg for the comparable period of the prior year 
all of breg s sales are recorded in our reconstruction market sector 
on a pro forma basis breg sales increased when compared to and would have represented of our total net sales in net sales in international orthofix international increased to million in from million in international net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the primary factors that led to this increase were currency  increased sales of external fixation products  strong start up sales of the pccp hip fracture fixation system and growth of non orthopedic airway management products  these were partially offset by a decrease in sales of the a v impulse system  primarily the impad component 
the decrease in a v impulse system sales was due to a combination of lower contract pricing  a more competitive environment and inventory balancing in the second quarter by our primary customer in the united states 
the impact of foreign currency increased international sales by million for  primarily as a result of a stronger euro and uk pound against the us dollar 
on a constant currency basis  international net sales would have been down 
the following table illustrates sales by market sector in international in thousands net sales net sales growth orthopedic spine reconstruction   trauma   total orthopedic   non orthopedic   international orthofix   sales by market sector net sales of our spine products grew to million in from million in sales of stimulation products for spine applications  the main component of our spine market sector  increased when compared to the same period of the prior year 
this market sector was negatively impacted by reimbursement issues relating to our orthotrac and ez brace products 
a change in the reimbursement for the ez brace product has had a negative impact on the period over period sales for this product 
on december   we announced fda approval for the cervical stim  the first and only on label bone growth stimulator for use as an adjunct to cervical upper spine fusions in high risk patients 
we expect this approval will positively impact the growth of this market sector in future periods 
we also acknowledge that reimbursement issues  emerging new technologies  including bmp s  and increased competitive activity for spinal stimulators could negatively impact growth in this market sector 
net sales of our reconstruction products increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily attributable to the sales of breg products  classified as reconstruction products  which totaled million in sales of our external fixation products used in reconstruction applications increased  which also contributed to the year over year growth in this market sector 
this market sector was negatively impacted in by lower sales of the a v impulse system  discussed above  which decreased when compared to net sales of our trauma products increased to million in from million in this market sector benefited from an growth in sales of external fixation products used for trauma applications  a growth in sales of stimulation products used for long bone applications  and strong start up sales of the pccp hip fracture fixation system 
net sales of our non orthopedic products grew to million in from million in this market sector continues to be driven by the airway management products  including a new single use version of the laryngeal mask which we distribute in the united kingdom  ireland and italy 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the increase of in net sales  including the addition of breg sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in was compared to in  reflecting the impact of the inclusion of breg with lower gross margins relative to pre breg gross profit margins  purchase accounting and foreign currency 
although currency contributed million to sales growth  the year over year appreciation of the euro and the uk pound against the uk dollar has been detrimental to our gross profit and gross profit margin in those situations where we produce products whose costs are denominated in euros and pounds and are sold in us dollars 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  which include commissions  royalties and bad debt provisions  generally increase and decrease in relation to sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of on a sales increase of 
the incremental increase is primarily the result of the addition of breg marketing and sales costs  for which there are no comparable costs in and the impact of currency 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease as a percent of net sales is primarily associated with our new breg segment  which carries a lower sales and marketing expense as a percent of net sales than the company has experienced in prior years 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million to million from million in this increase is primarily attributable to the additional general and administrative expenses of breg for which there are no comparable costs in the same period of the prior year  purchase accounting adjustments from the acquisition of breg for the depreciation of step up in the value of fixed assets acquired  and the acquisition of a puerto rico distributor  for which there are no comparable costs in we also incurred incremental internal and external costs associated with the successful compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and additional legal costs associated principally with the addition of new distribution 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of  and remained constant as a percentage of net sales at 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to expense related to breg  for which there are no comparable expenses in amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in the increase in amortization expense of approximately million was due to the amortization of the intangible recorded for the distribution network acquired in the breg acquisition 
litigation and settlement costs litigation and settlement costs for our case against kinetic concepts  inc kci was million in compared to million in further  in  we incurred million of settlement costs to conclude the investigation by the office of inspector general into the appropriateness of claims made to federal health care programs for the off label use of our fda approved pulsed electronic magnetic field device  and billing and coding for its off label use 
we expect to incur kci litigation costs in at approximately the same level as see item legal proceedings for a description of the legal proceedings 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net was an expense of million in compared to an expense of million in we incurred interest expense on borrowings under our senior secured term loan of million which included the amortization of debt costs and current year expenses associated with maintaining the term loan 
we also incurred million of expense relating to withholding taxes paid by us on a portion of the interest expense associated with the term loan 
additional interest expense of million was incurred on borrowings under a line of credit in italy 
we also generated million of interest income on cash deposits 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was income of million in compared to an expense of million in in  other income was generated by the sale of a facility that resulted in a gain of approximately million 
the sale of this facility was part of a consolidation plan in the united kingdom 
we also experienced foreign exchange gains of million  primarily as a result of uncovered trade receivables denominated in euros in subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar 
these gains were partially offset by other various transactional foreign currency losses associated with the euro and the uk pound 
loss in joint venture  net loss in joint venture  net was a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in during  we sold part of our ownership in the orthorx joint venture to our partner ferrer freedman company  this sale resulted in a gain of approximately million 
the gain was offset by our portion of the joint venture s operating losses in of approximately million 
as of december  our ownership percentage in the joint venture was and our investment in the joint venture had been reduced to zero 
income tax expense in and  the effective tax rate was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was reduced by the following i the non taxable gain recorded on the sale of orthorx shares  ii lower spending on the kci case which occurs in a low tax jurisdiction  and iii inherent tax benefits resulting from the financing structure of our senior secured term loan obtained in conjunction with the breg acquisition 
net income net income for was million compared to million in  an increase of 
net income was per basic share and per diluted share in  compared to per basic share and per diluted share for  an increase in diluted earnings per share of 
the weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding was  and  during and  respectively 
the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was  and  during and  respectively 
compared to sales net sales increased to million in from million in net sales by business segment in the americas primarily in the united states increased to million in compared to million in the americas net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the increase in net sales for was due to strong growth in the united states and brazil of net sales in all orthopedic product market sectors 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease in net sales of non orthofix products in mexico where we are discontinuing the distribution of certain non orthofix products 
net sales in international increased to million in from million in international net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the incremental impact of foreign exchange rates on international sales was to increase international net sales by million or approximately for  primarily as a result of a stronger euro and uk pound against the uk dollar 
net of foreign currency impact  international sales were up in all international subsidiaries except orthosonics  our bone cement removal business  with the largest increases in france and in our a v impulse business 
all of our market sectors experienced strong net sales growth in sales of spine products grew to million in from million in  with the sale of spinal stim bone growth stimulation products growing approximately in over increased sales of spinal stimulation resulted principally from an increase in the volume of stimulators sold and from the renewal of our distribution agreement with medtronic sofamor danek 
we estimate that the renewed distribution agreement had the effect of increasing sales by million in approval and introduction of bmps by medtronic sofamor danek have begun to show some market acceptance as a substitute for autograft bone in spinal fusion surgeries 
our spinal stim product is fda approved for both failed fusions and healing enhancement as an adjunct to spinal fusion surgery  most typically for multilevel or high risk patients 
in  medtronic sofamor danek group conducted clinical studies with bmps 
participation of physicians in the clinical studies had an adverse impact on our stimulation product sales growth in the second half of although product sales growth returned to historic product growth rates in  as physicians participate in further clinical studies with bmps  it could have a further adverse impact on stimulation product sales 
although bmps are considered or classified as a bone growth material  they have yet to be clinically proven to be effective in high risk patients 
our sales of reconstruction products grew to million in from million in  primarily due to sales of our a v impulse system  which grew in  as well as from sales of exfix products for reconstruction such as the sheffield ring system and several international distribution products all experienced strong double digit rates of growth 
sales of trauma products grew to million in from million in sales of our physio stim bone growth stimulator for long bone non unions grew approximately in over while exfix products for trauma grew approximately 
sales of non orthopedic products  principally the laryngeal mask which we distribute in the united kingdom  ireland and italy  grew by to million in from million in gross profit our gross profit increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the increase in net sales of 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to in from in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of a higher growth rate in higher margin bone growth stimulation product sales  including the renewal of our distribution agreement with medtronic sofamor danek  the favorable impact of additional direct distribution and continuing improvement in manufacturing efficiencies in our united states operations 
these positive impacts were partially offset by a negative foreign currency impact 
although foreign currency contributed million to our international sales growth  the year over year appreciation of the euro and the uk pound against the uk dollar increased production costs of external fixation and vascular products  which was detrimental to our gross profit and gross profit margin in those situations where we sell these products in us dollars 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  which include commissions  royalties and bad debt provisions  generally increase and decrease in relation to sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of on a sales increase of 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in reflects the negative impact of foreign currency on international operating expenses  higher commissions on stimulation sales under the terms of our renewed distribution agreement with medtronic sofamor danek and additional costs to support the hiring of additional sales people and the launch of new products 
the pccp product was launched in the international market in the second quarter and on a limited basis in the united states in the third quarter 
in connection with the launch of the pccp product  we conducted a large training seminar for surgeons in verona  italy and a training seminar for us surgeons in chicago 
further  we conducted training meetings for the sales force in europe and the united states 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million to million from million in general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the increase in also reflects the negative impact of foreign currency on international operating expenses 
in addition  we incurred additional expenses associated with becoming a us sec registrant and with building administrative support in our direct sales organizations in europe and mexico 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of  and decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales to in from in research and development decreased as a percent of net sales in as a result of a decrease in clinical study spending in our international unit 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in amortization of intangible assets consists principally of the amortization of patents and trademarks 
litigation and settlement costs based on an assessment of the merits of our case against kinetic concepts  inc kci  we incurred million in litigation costs in compared to no expense in we also incurred million of settlement cost to conclude the investigation by the office of inspector general into the appropriateness of claims made to federal health care programs for the off label use of our fda approved pulsed electronic magnetic field device  and billing and coding for its off label use 
see item legal proceedings for a description of the legal proceedings 
we expect to incur additional kci litigation costs in  but at a lower rate than they were incurred in interest income expense  net interest income expense  net was an expense of million in compared to income of million in other income expense  net other income expense  net was income of million in compared to an expense of million in the increase in income was a result of a gain on foreign exchange transactions in of million  compared with a loss in of million  resulting in net improvement of million 
we also realized an additional million gain on the sale of available for sale marketable securities 
loss in joint venture  net loss in joint venture  net was a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in these losses represented our share of losses in the orthorx joint venture  an improvement of million from income tax expense in and  the effective tax rate was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was negatively impacted by as a result of the kci litigation expenses  a majority of which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate was also affected by the fact that a larger proportion of pre tax earnings was earned in the united states  a relatively higher tax jurisdiction 
net income net income for was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  compared to million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for  a decrease in net income of

the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was  and  during and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  of which million is subject to certain restrictions under the senior secured credit agreement described below 
this compares to million at december   an increase of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
net cash provided by operating activities is comprised of net income  non cash items and changes in working capital including changes in restricted cash 
net income increased approximately million to million in from million in non cash items increased million in compared to  primarily as a result of the increased depreciation and amortization expense of million associated with the application of purchase accounting to the assets acquired in the breg acquisition partially offset by a decrease in losses or equity investments and an increase in deferred tax benefits 
working capital accounts consumed million of cash in compared to the use of million in cash during the principal use of cash for working capital in was the designation of million of cash as restricted cash 
the restricted cash is held at colgate medical limited and its subsidiaries and is restricted in conjunction with the company s senior secured credit facility 
the cash is only restricted from being dividend  advanced or loaned to the parent company 
all other subsidiaries of the orthofix group have access to this cash for operational purposes 
the other uses of cash for working capital in were accounts receivable of million and the final payout pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger among the company and american medical electronics  inc the aggregate amount of the payout was million which had previously been fully reserved 
increases in accounts receivable stem principally from the increase in year over year sales and an increase in italian receivables 
as expected  we factored approximately million in italian receivables in the fourth quarter of and our italian accounts receivable are consistent with published dso statistics for italian healthcare suppliers 
overall performance indicators of our two primary working capital accounts  accounts receivable and inventory  reflect days sales in receivables of days at december  compared to days days on a pro forma basis including breg at december  and inventory turnover of times at december  compared to times times on a pro forma basis including breg at december  net cash used in investing activities was million during  compared to million during during  we paid million as part of the consideration for the purchase of a puerto rican distributor 
capital expenditures in were approximately million for tangible assets and million for intangible assets  including a payment of million to purchase the technology of the pccp hip fracture fixation system 
in  we also purchased the remaining minority interest in our switzerland subsidiary  orthofix ag  for approximately million 
further  in we paid million for transaction fees associated with the acquisition of breg 
during we received million from the sale of shares in the orthorx joint venture  million from the sale of a facility in the uk  and million from a contract settlement in mexico 
during  we purchased the remaining minority interest in our uk distribution company for million  invested million to take an equity interest in innovative spinal technologies ist  invested an additional million in the orthorx joint venture and on december  completed the acquisition of breg for million plus closing adjustments and transaction costs totaling approximately million 
in addition we invested million in capital expenditures 
in  we anticipate the use of cash for tangible and intangible capital expenditures will be approximately million compared to million in net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in in  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of  shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options  warrants and shares purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in  we repaid approximately million against the principal of the senior secured term loan obtained to help finance the breg acquisition  paid million against other outstanding debt 
further in  we paid million for costs associated with obtaining the senior secured term loan and paid million for costs associated with an amendment to the senior secured term loan  which will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility 
the majority of the financing activity in resulted from the completion of a senior secured term loan for million obtained in conjunction with the breg acquisition 
when we acquired breg on december   one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  colgate medical limited colgate  entered into a senior secured bank credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions to finance the transaction 
the senior secured bank facility provides for a five year amortizing term loan facility of million  the proceeds of which were used for partial payment of the purchase price of breg  and a five year revolving credit facility of million 
as of december  and as of march   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the term loan facility 
obligations under the senior secured bank facility have a floating interest rate of libor or prime rate plus a margin  currently libor plus  which is adjusted quarterly based on colgate s leverage ratio 
in may we entered into a three year fully amortizable interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million and an expiration date of june  the amount outstanding under the swap as of december  was million 
under the swap we will pay a fixed rate of and receive interest at floating rates based on the three month libor rate at each quarterly re pricing date until the expiration of the swap 
as of december  the interest rate on the debt related to the swap was plus a margin of 
our effective interest rate  including the impact of the swap  as of december  on our senior secured debt was 
orthofix and each of colgate s direct and indirect subsidiaries  including orthofix inc and breg  have guaranteed the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility 
the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility and colgate s subsidiaries under their guarantees are secured by the pledges of their respective assets 
certain of our other subsidiaries have also guaranteed the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility on a limited recourse basis 
during  colgate entered into an amendment of the term loan facility 
the amendment reduced the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the term loan facility by reducing the initial interest rate of libor plus to libor plus 
during the third quarter of we made an additional voluntary prepayment of million on the borrowings under the term loan facility 
the amendment along with this prepayment further reduced the interest rate to libor plus upon delivering our third quarter compliance report to the lender s administrative agent that evidenced our attainment of a leverage ratio threshold that reduced the interest rate 
the credit agreement relating to the senior secured bank facility contains customary negative covenants applicable to colgate and its subsidiaries  including restrictions on indebtedness  liens  dividends  mergers and the sale of assets 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio applicable to colgate and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  and a leverage ratio applicable to orthofix and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
we have assessed our compliance with the financial covenants as of december   as required by the credit agreement  and note that we are in compliance with all financial covenants 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and unused available lines of credit of approximately million under a line of credit established in italy to finance the working capital of our italian operations 
the terms of the line of credit give us the option to borrow amounts in italy at rates determined at the time of borrowing 
we continue to search for viable acquisition candidates that would expand our global presence as well as additional products appropriate for current distribution channels 
an acquisition of another company or product line by us could result in our incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities 
we believe that current cash balances together with projected cash flows from operating activities  the unused revolving credit facility and available italian line of credit  the exercise of stock options  and our remaining available debt capacity are sufficient to cover anticipated operating capital needs and research and development costs over the near term 
contractual obligations the following chart sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than to to over year years years years senior secured term loan    other borrowings operating leases      total      in addition to scheduled contractual obligations of the debt as set forth above  our senior secured bank facility requires us to make mandatory prepayments with a the excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement of colgate and its subsidiaries in an amount initially equal to of the excess annual cash flow of colgate and its subsidiaries  reducing to upon the attainment of a leverage ratio of less than or equal to to  b the net cash proceeds of any debt or equity issuances  excluding the exercise of stock options  by any of the credit parties as defined in the credit agreement  c the net cash proceeds of asset dispositions over a minimum threshold  or d unless reinvested  insurance proceeds or condemnation awards 
during  we voluntarily prepaid million which was applied to the excess annual cash flow obligation 
after applying the voluntary prepayments  we have no additional obligation under the excess cash flow provision as of and for the period ended december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
these exposures can vary sales  cost of goods  and costs of operations  the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
however  our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold nor do we enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had an interest rate hedge transaction in place that swapped variable rate debt for a fixed rate 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our senior secured term loan and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on london inter bank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
therefore  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt represented by borrowings under our senior secured term loans at an interest rate of of which million was swapped for fixed rate debt at an interest rate of 
based on the balance outstanding under the credit facility as of december  and the swap agreement  an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate on the variable rate debt would cause an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was million at december  our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  great britain pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we face cost of goods currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the euro or great britain pound and sell those products in us dollars 
we face transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
we also face currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was favorably impacted in and by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the local foreign currency in and the us dollar equivalent of the related costs denominated in these foreign currencies was unfavorably impacted in and as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results 
historically  we have not used financial derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates
