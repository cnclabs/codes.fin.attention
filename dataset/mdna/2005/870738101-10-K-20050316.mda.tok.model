item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis supplements and is provided to facilitate increased understanding of our  and consolidated financial statements and our accompanying notes included with this report 
overview for  we had revenues of million and production of bcfe 
our revenues were bolstered by oil and gas prices remaining strong and our domestic production for increasing to bcfe or by compared to we continued to focus our efforts and capital throughout the year on infrastructure improvements  increased production and the development of long lived reserves in the lake washington and awp olmos areas 
our net production in lake washington for the fourth quarter of almost doubled as compared to the same period in  averaging approximately  net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of  compared to approximately  net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the same period in during  capital expenditures were also used for development in our other domestic core areas 
new zealand accounted for bcfe of production in  a decrease from production in the same period in natural gas production in new zealand declined primarily due to natural production declines in our tawn properties 
the tawn gas contract was renegotiated to lower the total contract quantity and deliverability rates  and we anticipate meeting these revised contracted volumes 
there is no penalty if the fields are unable to produce the minimum contracted volumes under the tawn gas contract 
new zealand natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl contracts are denominated in the new zealand dollar  which has significantly strengthened during the last several years against the us dollar 
our production costs were up in predominantly because of increased production in lake washington  higher severance taxes due to increased domestic revenues  and currency exchange rates in new zealand 
our general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to an increase in costs related to our on going compliance efforts with the sarbanes oxley act  and to increased salaries and benefits 
our debt to pv ratio decreased to at december  compared to at december   due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices  which have increased our pv value 
our debt to capitalization ratio was at december  compared to at year end  as debt levels increased slightly in but were offset by the increase in retained earnings as a result of current year profit 
in june  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes due through a tender offer 
in july  we repurchased million of our notes at the close of the tender offer 
on august   we redeemed the remaining million of these notes in accordance with our redemption rights under the indenture governing these notes 
in  we recorded approximately million of debt retirement costs related to the repurchase of these notes 
the redemption of these notes lowered our effective interest rate 
year end proved reserves of bcfe  representing a decline for the year  were crude oil  natural gas and ngls  compared to year end proved reserves of bcfe  which were crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
proved developed reserves remained essentially the same at of total reserves at year end  compared to the previous year 
domestic proved reserves increased at year end to bcfe  driven by the acquisition of reserves in december in the bay de chene and cote blanche island fields  which were predominantly proved undeveloped 
proved reserves in new zealand decreased to bcfe at year end  primarily attributable to production and slight downward revisions in the manutahi and upper tariki sands 
in we focused our drilling activity  both domestically and in new zealand  on proved undeveloped locations that helped maximize production in a high price environment  but which also resulted in smaller additions to proved reserves 
results of operations years ended   and revenues 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in  and our revenues in increased by compared to revenues due primarily to increases in oil and natural gas prices in each successive year and increases in production from our lake washington area 
revenues from our oil and gas sales comprised substantially all of total revenues for and  and of total revenues for crude oil production comprised of our production volumes in  in  and in natural gas production comprised of our production volumes in  in  and in domestic production comprised of our total production volumes in  in  and in the following table provides information regarding the changes in the sources of our oil and gas sales and volumes for the years ended december    and oil and gas oil and gas sales sales volume in millions bcfe area awp olmos brookeland lake washington masters creek other total domestic rimu kauri tawn total new zealand total oil and gas sales in increased by  or million  from the level of those revenues for  and our net sales volumes in increased by  or bcfe  over net sales volumes in average prices for oil increased to per bbl in from per bbl in average natural gas prices increased to per mcf in from per mcf in average ngl prices increased to per bbl in from per bbl in in  our million increase in oil  ngl  and natural gas sales resulted from o price variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the increase in average oil prices received  million was attributable to the increase in natural gas prices and million was attributable to the increase in ngl prices  and o volume variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  with million of increases attributable to the million bbl increase in oil sales volumes and million to the  bbl increase in ngl sales volumes  offset by a decrease of million due to the bcf decrease in natural gas sales volumes primarily from our tawn area in new zealand

our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the increase was due to an million increase in dd a  an million increase in severance and other taxes  and a million increase in lease operating costs  all of which are primarily due to increased production volumes and oil and gas commodity prices in we also recorded million of debt retirement costs in our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the increase was due to a million increase in lease operating costs  a million increase in severance and other taxes  and a million increase in dd a  all of which increased as our production volumes and revenues increased in our general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  over levels 
the increase in both and were primarily due to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  increased salaries and burdens  and our increased activities in new zealand 
in  sarbanes oxley act compliance costs  including internal and external costs  totaled million 
the increase in was also due to a reduction in reimbursements from partnerships that we managed as almost all of the partnerships have been liquidated  along with an increase in franchise tax expense 
for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for dd a increased million  or  in from levels  while dd a increased million  or  from levels 
domestically  dd a increased million in due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base  higher production in the period and slightly lower reserve volumes 
in new zealand  dd a increased by million in due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base along with lower reserve volumes  offset by lower production in the period 
in  our domestic dd a increased by million due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base  offset by slightly lower production in the period and higher reserve volumes that were added primarily through our lake washington activities 
our new zealand dd a increased by million in due to increased production in the period 
our dd a rate per mcfe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from increases in per unit cost of reserves additions 
we recorded million and million of accretions to our asset retirement obligation in and  respectively 
our lease operating costs per mcfe produced were in  in and in there were no supervision fees recorded as a reduction to production costs in  while there were million in and million in our lease operating costs in increased million  or  over the level of such expenses in  while costs increased million  or over approximately million of the increase in lease operating costs during was related to our domestic operations  which increased primarily due to increased compression and chemical costs in lake washington resulting from higher production from our lake washington area along with the reduction of expense of million from supervision fees 
our lease operating cost in new zealand increased in by million due to the continued development of our rimu kauri area and the increased currency exchange rate of the new zealand dollar as compared to the us dollar 
approximately million of the increase in was due to our new zealand operations as production increased over levels 
severance and other taxes increased million  or over levels  while in these taxes increased million  or over levels 
the increase was due primarily to higher commodity prices and increased lake washington and rimu kauri production in each of the periods 
severance taxes on oil in louisiana are of oil sales  which is higher than the other states where we have production 
as our percentage of oil production in louisiana increases  the overall percentage of severance costs to sales also increases 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
interest expense on our senior notes due issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes due issued in april  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in and million in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes issued in august and repurchased and retired in  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  and million in both and interest expense on our bank credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in other interest cost was million in our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
we capitalize a portion of interest related to unproved properties 
the increase of interest expense in was due to lower capitalized interest than in the increase in interest expense in was attributed to the replacement of our bank borrowings in april with our senior subordinated notes due with a longer repayment term but a higher interest rate 
in  we incurred million of debt retirement costs related to the repurchase and redemption of our senior subordinated notes due the costs were comprised of approximately million of premiums paid to repurchase the notes  million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs  million to write off unamortized debt discount and approximately million of other costs 
the overall effective tax rate was in both and and in the effective tax rate for was lower than the statutory tax rates primarily due to reductions from the new zealand statutory rate attributable to the currency effect on the new zealand deferred tax calculation  along with favorable corrections to tax basis amounts discovered while preparing the prior year s tax returns 
these amounts were partially offset by higher deferred state income taxes 
income tax expense in includes a reduction of approximately million from the us statutory rate  primarily from the result of the currency exchange rate effect on the new zealand deferred tax 
this amount was partially offset by higher domestic state income taxes and other items 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a one time net of taxes charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income 
net income 
our net income in of million was higher than our net income of million due to higher commodity prices and increased production 
our net income in of million was higher than our net income of million due to higher commodity prices and increased production 
contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total in thousands non cancelable operating leases        asset retirement obligation   drilling rigs and seismic   senior notes due   senior subordinated notes due   credit facility   total        our office lease in houston  texas extends until amounts shown by year are the fair values at december  amounts do not include the interest obligation  which is paid semiannually 
the credit facility expires in october and these amounts exclude a million standby letter of credit outstanding under this facility 
commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future 
the price of oil has increased over the last two years and is currently significantly higher when compared to longer term historical prices 
factors such as worldwide supply disruptions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  actions taken by opec  and fluctuating currency exchange rates can cause wide fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices continue to remain high when compared to longer term historical prices 
north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  storage levels of natural gas  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
such factors are beyond our control 
liquidity and capital resources during  we largely relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million  the issuance of our senior notes due  proceeds from the sale of non core properties and equipment of million  less the repayment of our senior subordinated notes due to fund capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million 
during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million  proceeds from bank borrowings of million  and proceeds from the sale of non core properties and equipment of million to fund capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher commodity prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs due to higher domestic production and severance taxes as a result of higher commodity prices in in  net cash provided by operating activities increased by to million  as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of oil and gas sales of million due to higher commodity prices and production 
accounts receivable 
included in the accounts receivable balance  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  on the accompanying balance sheets  is approximately million of receivables related to hydrocarbon volumes produced from and that have been disputed since early as a result of the dispute  we did not record a receivable with regard to any disputed volumes and our contract governing these sales expired in we assess the collectibility of accounts receivable and  based on our judgment  we accrue a reserve when we believe a receivable may not be collected 
at december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has been deducted from the total accounts receivable balances on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
we have incurred substantial costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of these expenditures have reduced our net cash provided by operating activities in each of the last two years 
in  sarbanes oxley act compliance costs  including internal and external costs  totaled million and are reflected in general and administrative  net on the accompanying statements of income 
we expect the costs of sarbanes oxley compliance to decrease from levels in future years 
existing credit facility 
we had million in borrowings under our bank credit facility at december   and million in outstanding borrowings at december  our bank credit facility at december  consisted of a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base 
the borrowing base is re determined at least every six months and was reaffirmed by our bank group at million  effective november  in june  we renewed this credit facility  increasing the facility amount to million from million and extending its expiration to october  from october  we maintained the commitment amount at million  which amount was set at our request effective may  under the terms of our bank credit facility  we can increase this commitment amount to the total amount of the borrowing base at our discretion  subject to the terms of the credit agreement 
our revolving credit facility includes  among other restrictions that changed somewhat as the facility was renewed and extended  requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement 
our access to funds from our credit facility is not restricted under any material adverse condition clause  a clause that is common for credit agreements to include 
a material adverse condition clause can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have an adverse or material effect on our operations  financial condition  prospects or properties  and would impair our ability to make timely debt repayments 
our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report events or conditions having a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 
working capital 
our working capital improved from a deficit of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the improvement primarily resulted from a decrease in accrued capital costs due to a reduction in our drilling activities at year end in comparison with year end activity  along with an increase in accounts receivable for oil and gas sales due to higher sales volumes and commodity prices 
repurchase of senior subordinated notes due in june  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes due pursuant to a tender offer  and recorded debt retirement costs of million related to this repurchase 
in july  we repurchased approximately million of these notes  and as of august   we redeemed the remaining million of these notes 
we have recorded a total of million in debt retirement costs related to the total repurchase of these notes 
debt maturities 
our credit facility extends until october  our million of senior notes mature july   and our million of senior subordinated notes mature may  capital expenditures 
we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million  the issuance of our senior notes due  and proceeds from the sale of non core properties and equipment of million  less the repayment of our senior subordinated notes due  to fund capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million 
our total capital expenditures of approximately million in included domestic expenditures of million as follows o million for drilling and developmental activity costs  predominantly in our lake washington area  o million on property acquisitions  including million to acquire properties in the bay de chene and cote blanche island fields  o million of domestic prospect costs  principally prospect leasehold  lake washington three dimensional seismic activity  and geological costs of unproved prospects  o million on exploratory drilling  mainly in our lake washington area  o million primarily for a field office building  computer equipment  software  furniture  and fixtures  o million on field compression facilities  and o million on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas 
new zealand expenditures of million as follows o million for drilling costs and developmental activity costs  predominantly in our rimu kauri area  o million on prospect costs  principally prospect leasehold  seismic and geological costs of unproved properties  o million on gas processing plants  o million on exploratory drilling  and o million for computer equipment  software  furniture  and fixtures 
we have spent considerable time and capital in and on significant facility capacity upgrades in the lake washington field to increase facility capacity to approximately  barrels per day for crude oil  up from  barrels per day capacity in the first quarter of we have upgraded three production platforms  added new compression for the gas lift system  and installed a new oil delivery system and permanent barge loading facility 
we successfully completed of wells in  for a success rate of 
domestically  we completed of development wells for a success rate of and completed four of ten exploration wells 
a total of wells were drilled in the lake washington area  of which were completed  and wells were drilled in the awp olmos area  of which were completed 
in new zealand  we completed of wells  consisting of four kauri sand wells drilled  five of six manutahi sand wells  and the tariki d well 
our capital expenditure budget is million to million  net of million to million of dispositions and excluding any acquisitions 
approximately of the budget is targeted for domestic activities  primarily in south louisiana  with about planned for activities in new zealand 
approximately million to million of the budget will be focused on activity in the newly acquired properties in bay de chene and cote blanche island fields 
the million to million of dispositions relate to non core properties planned for later in we expect that our capital expenditures will begin at the low end of the range  and depending on commodity prices and operational performance  they may increase to the high end of the range during the course of the year 
we anticipate capital expenditures to approximate our cash flows provided from operating activities during  similar to for  we are targeting total production and proved reserves to increase to over the levels 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million  proceeds from bank borrowings of million  and proceeds from the sale of non core properties and equipment of million to fund capital expenditures of million 
during  we principally relied upon cash provided by operating activities of million  net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million of senior subordinated notes due  and net proceeds from our public stock offering of million  less the repayment of bank borrowings of million  to fund capital expenditures of million 
our capital expenditures in of approximately million included domestic activities of million as follows o million on drilling and developmental activities  primarily in our lake washington area  o million for the construction of production and surface facilities  mainly in our lake washington area  o million on exploratory drilling  primarily in our lake washington area  o million on domestic prospect costs  principally leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  o million on field compression facilities  o million for producing property acquisitions  o million for fixed assets  and o million on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas 
new zealand activities of million as follows o million on developmental activities primarily to further delineate the rimu kauri area  o million on prospect costs  o million on gas processing plants  o million for exploratory drilling mainly for the tuihu exploratory well  o million on producing properties acquisitions  and o million for fixed assets 
in  we participated in drilling domestic development wells and eight domestic exploratory wells  of which development wells and five exploratory wells were completed 
in new zealand we drilled and completed three development wells and drilled one unsuccessful exploratory well 
income tax regulations the tax laws in the jurisdictions we operate in are continuously changing and professional judgments regarding such tax laws can differ 
we do not believe the recently enacted american jobs creation act of will have a material impact on our financial position or cash flow from operations in the near term 
new accounting principles in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements the interpretation 
the interpretation significantly changes whether entities included in its scope are consolidated by their sponsors  transferors  or investors 
the interpretation introduces a new consolidation model the variable interest model  which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation 
the interpretation provides guidance for determining whether an entity lacks sufficient equity or its equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
these variable interest entities vies are covered by the interpretation and are to be evaluated for consolidation based on their variable interests 
these provisions applied immediately to variable interests in vies created after january   and to variable interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after december  the provisions apply for all other types of variable interests in vies for periods ending after march  we have no variable interests in vies  nor do we have variable interests in special purpose entities 
the adoption of this interpretation had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september and november  the eitf discussed a proposed framework for addressing when a limited partnership should be consolidated by its general partner  eitf issue the proposed framework presumes that a sole general partner in a limited partnership controls the limited partnership  and therefore should consolidate the limited partnership 
the presumption of control can be overcome if the limited partners have a the substantive ability to remove the sole general partner or otherwise dissolve the limited partnership or b substantive participating rights 
the eitf reached a tentative conclusion on the circumstances in which either kick out rights or protective rights would be considered substantive and preclude consolidation by the general partner and what limited partner s rights would be considered participating rights that would preclude consolidation by the general partner 
the eitf tentatively concluded that for kick out rights to be considered substantive  the conditions specified in paragraph b of fin r should be met 
with regard to the definition of participating rights that would preclude consolidation by the general partner  the eitf concluded that the definition of those rights should be consistent with those in eitf issue the eitf also reached a tentative conclusion on the transition for issue we do not believe this eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we believe our limited partners have substantive kick out rights under paragraph b of fin r 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab expresses the sec staff s views regarding sfas no 
and its impact on both the full cost ceiling test and the calculation of depletion expense 
in accordance with sab  beginning in the fourth quarter of  undiscounted abandonment cost for future wells  not recorded at the present time but needed to develop the proved reserves in existence at the present time  should be included in the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties  net of related salvage value  for purposes of computing dd a 
the effect of including undiscounted abandonment costs of future wells to the undiscounted cost of oil and gas properties will increase depletion expense in future periods  however  we currently do not believe such increases will be material 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all employee share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas no 
discontinues the ability to account for these equity instruments under the intrinsic value method as described in apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods o a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
o a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we have elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method is expected to have a significant impact on our result of operations 
however  it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we currently use the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of sfas no 
r 
the significance of the impact of adoption will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in stock based compensation  under note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
statement no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of excess tax deductions recognized were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these deductions resulted in an increase in operating cash flows  however  due to the company s net operating tax loss position  deferred income taxes were reduced rather than actual cash taxes paid 
proved oil and gas reserves 
at year end  our total proved reserves were bcfe with a pv value of billion 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves decreased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent decrease of bcfe  or 
in  our proved natural gas reserves increased by bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased by mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves decreased by mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of bcfe  or 
we added reserves over the past three years through both our drilling activity and purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added bcfe all of which was domestic of proved reserves in  bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in  and bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in through acquisitions we added bcfe of proved reserves in  bcfe in  and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end the pv value of our total proved reserves increased from the pv value at year end gas prices increased in to per mcf from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end oil prices increased in to per bbl from per bbl at year end  compared to in under sec guidelines  estimates of proved reserves must be made using year end oil and gas sales prices and are held constant  for that year s reserve calculation  throughout the life of the properties 
subsequent changes to such year end oil and gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of certain assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
significant estimates that were used to prepare these financial statements include o the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion of our properties and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows from these properties  o accruals related to oil and gas production and revenues  capital expenditures and lease operating and severance tax expenses  o the estimated future cost and timing of asset retirement obligations  and o estimates made in our income tax calculations 
while we are not aware of any significant revisions to any of our estimates  there will likely be future revisions to our estimates resulting from matters such as changes in ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by purchasers or pipelines  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry  many of which require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such costs may be incurred both prior to and after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion  and equipment 
internal costs incurred that are directly identified with exploration  development  and acquisition activities undertaken by us for our own account  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities  are also capitalized 
for the years   and  such internal costs capitalized totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest costs are also capitalized to unproved oil and gas properties 
for the years   and  capitalized interest on unproved properties totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest not capitalized and general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
full costceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties  including gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties  excluding cash outflows from asset retirement obligations  including future abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using period end prices  adjusted for the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
our hedges at year end consisted mainly of natural gas and crude oil price floors with strike prices lower than the period end price and thus did not materially affect prices used in this calculation 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis for those countries with proved reserves 
the calculation of the ceiling test and provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization is based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that non cash write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
price risk management activities 
the company follows sfas no 
 which requires that changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts is recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
hedge accounting for a qualifying hedge allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting  and the ineffective portion of the hedge  are recognized currently in income 
we have a price risk management policy to use derivative instruments to protect against declines in oil and gas prices  mainly through the purchase of price floors and collars 
during  and  we recognized net losses of million  million and million  respectively  relating to our derivative activities 
this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
at december   the company had recorded million  net of taxes of million  of derivative losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax on the accompanying balance sheet 
this amount represents the change in fair value for the effective portion of our hedging transactions that qualified as cash flow hedges 
the ineffectiveness reported in price risk management and other  net for  and was not material 
we expect to reclassify all amounts currently held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax into the statement of income within the next twelve months when the forecasted sale of hedged production occurs 
at december   we had in place price floors in effect through the december contract month for natural gas  these cover a portion of our domestic natural gas production for january to december the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our natural gas price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our domestic natural gas production from january to december at december   we also had in place crude oil price floors in effect through the march contract month  which cover a portion our domestic crude oil production for january to march the crude oil price floors cover notional volumes of  barrels  with a weighted average floor price of per barrel 
our crude oil price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our domestic crude oil production from january to march when we entered into these transactions discussed above  they were designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of natural gas and crude oil production 
changes in the fair value of a hedge that is highly effective and is designated and documented and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax 
when the hedged transactions are recorded upon the actual sale of oil and natural gas  these gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax and recorded in price risk management and other  net on the consolidated statement of income 
the fair value of our derivatives are computed using the black scholes option pricing model and are periodically verified against quotes from brokers 
the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the balance sheet in other current assets 
from january to the date of this filing  we entered into additional natural gas price floors covering contract periods april to october  which cover our natural gas production for april to october notional volumes are  mmbtu at a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu

stock based compensation 
we have two stock based compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we issued restricted stock for the first time in  and recorded expense related to these shares of less than million in general and administrative  net on the accompanying statements of income 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee stock options  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant  or in the case of the employee stock purchase plan  the purchase price is of the lower of the closing price of our common stock as quoted on the new york stock exchange at the beginning or end of the plan year or a date during the year chosen by the participant 
foreign currency 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand 
the functional currency is determined by examining the entities cash flows  commodity pricing  environment and financing arrangements 
we have both assets and liabilities denominated in new zealand dollars  predominantly a portion of our deferred income taxes and a portion of our asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheet 
for accounts other than deferred income taxes  as the currency rate changes between the us dollar and the new zealand dollar  we recognize transaction gains and losses in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
we recognize transaction gains and losses on deferred income taxes in provision for income taxes on the accompanying statement of income 
related party transactions we have been the operator of a number of properties owned by affiliated limited partnerships and  accordingly  charge these entities operating fees 
the operating fees charged to the partnerships totaled approximately million in and and approximately million in  and are recorded as reductions of general and administrative  net 
we also have been reimbursed for administrative  and overhead costs incurred in conducting the business of the limited partnerships  which totaled approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively  and are recorded as reductions in general and administrative  net 
included in accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets  is less than million and million  respectively  in receivables from and payables to the partnerships at december  we receive research  technical writing  publishing  and website related services from tec com inc  a corporation located in knoxville  tennessee and controlled by the sister of the company s chairman and vice chairman of the board

the contract was renewed june  on substantially the same terms and expires june  we believe that the terms of this contract are consistent with third party arrangements that provide similar services 
as a matter of corporate governance policy and practice  related party transactions are annually presented and considered by the corporate governance committee of our board of directors in accordance with the committee s charter 
other factors affecting our business and financial results oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
a substantial decrease in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results 
our future financial condition  results of operations  and the value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon market prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the recent record high oil and natural gas prices may not continue and could drop precipitously in a short period of time 
the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  import prices  political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  and actions taken by opec 
a significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would negatively affect us in several ways o our cash flow would be reduced  decreasing funds available for capital expenditures employed to increase production or replace reserves  o certain reserves would no longer be economic to produce  leading to both lower cash flow and proved reserves  o our lenders could reduce the borrowing base under our bank credit facility because of lower oil and natural gas reserve values  reducing our liquidity and possibly requiring mandatory loan repayments  and o access to other sources of capital  such as equity or long term debt markets  could be severely limited or unavailable in a low price environment 
consequently  our revenues and profitability would suffer 
our level of debt could reduce our financial flexibility  and we currently have the ability to incur substantially more debt  including secured debt 
as of december   our total debt comprised approximately of our total capitalization 
although our bank credit facility and indentures limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  in the future if specified conditions are satisfied 
all borrowings under our bank credit facility are effectively senior to our outstanding senior notes and senior subordinated notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing those borrowings 
our current level of indebtedness o will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of interest  o will subject us to a higher financial risk in an economic downturn due to substantial debt service costs  o may limit our ability to obtain financing or raise equity capital in the future  and o may place us at a competitive disadvantage to the extent that we are more highly leveraged than some of our peers 
higher levels of indebtedness would increase these risks 
estimates of proved reserves are uncertain  and revenues from production may vary significantly from expectations 
the quantities and values of our proved reserves included in this report are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties 
estimates by other engineers might differ materially 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation 
these estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves  future prices for oil and natural gas  timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses  all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates 
these variances may be significant 
any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserve reports 
in addition  results of drilling  testing  production  and changes in prices after the date of the estimates of our reserves may result in substantial downward revisions 
these estimates may not accurately predict the present value of net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully  which may not occur 
if we cannot replace our reserves  our revenues and financial condition will suffer 
unless we successfully replace our reserves  our long term production will decline  which could result in lower revenues and cash flow 
when oil and natural gas prices decrease  our cash flow decreases  resulting in less available cash to drill and replace our reserves and an increased need to draw on our bank credit facility 
even if we have the capital to drill  unsuccessful wells can hurt our efforts to replace reserves 
additionally  lower oil and natural gas prices can have the effect of lowering our reserve estimates and the number of economically viable prospects that we have to drill 
drilling wells is speculative and capital intensive 
developing and exploring properties for oil and natural gas requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial risk 
the budgeted costs of drilling  completing  and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise 
drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons  including title problems  weather  cost overruns  equipment shortages  and mechanical difficulties 
moreover  the successful drilling or completion of an oil or gas well does not ensure a profit on investment 
exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations 
we are not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including the possibility of o environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas  or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater and shoreline contamination  o abnormally pressured formations  o mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse  o fires and explosions  o personal injuries and death  and o natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currencies  primarily the new zealand dollar 
fluctuations in rates between the new zealand dollar and us dollar impact our financial results from our new zealand subsidiaries since we have receivables  liabilities  and natural gas and ngl sales contracts denominated in new zealand dollars 
we do not hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
although we may use hedging techniques in the future  we may not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of currency fluctuations 
as a result  exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we have incurred a write down of the carrying values of our properties in the past and could incur additional write downs in the future 
under the full cost method of accounting  sec accounting rules require that on a quarterly basis we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties on a country by country basis for possible write down or impairment 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved reserves may not exceed a ceiling calculated at the present value of estimated future net revenues from those proved reserves  determined using a per year discount and unescalated prices in effect as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
capital costs in excess of the ceiling must be permanently written down 
we recorded an after tax  non cash charge during the fourth quarter of of million 
this write down resulted in a charge to earnings and a reduction of stockholders equity  but did not impact our cash flow from operating activities 
if commodity prices decline or if we have significant downward reserve revisions  we could incur additional write downs in the future 
substantial acquisitions or other transactions could require significant external capital and could change our risk and property profile 
to finance acquisitions  we may need to substantially alter or increase our capitalization through the use of our bank credit facility  the issuance of debt or equity securities  the sale of production payments  or by other means 
these changes in capitalization may significantly affect our risk profile 
additionally  significant acquisitions or other transactions can change the character of our operations and business 
the character of the new properties may be substantially different in operating or geological characteristics or geographic location than our existing properties 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain external funding for any such acquisitions or other transactions or to obtain external funding on terms acceptable to us 
reserves on acquired properties may not meet our expectations  and we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with acquired properties or obtain protection from sellers against associated liabilities 
property acquisition decisions are based on various assumptions and subjective judgments that are speculative 
although available geological and geophysical information can provide information about the potential of a property  it is impossible to predict accurately a property s production and profitability 
in addition  we may have difficulty integrating future acquisitions into our operations  and they may not achieve our desired profitability objectives 
likewise  as is customary in the industry  we generally acquire oil and gas acreage without any warranty of title except through the transferor 
in many instances  title opinions are not obtained if  in our judgment  it would be uneconomical or impractical to do so 
losses may result from title defects or from defects in the assignment of leasehold rights 
while our current operations are primarily in louisiana  texas  and new zealand  we may pursue acquisitions of properties located in other geographic areas  which would decrease our geographical concentration  and could also be in areas in which we have no or limited experience 
in addition  our assessment of acquired properties may not reveal all existing or potential problems or liabilities  nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their capabilities and deficiencies 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform  or pipeline 
inspections may not reveal structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion or groundwater contamination 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that it created 
we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of acquired properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 
there is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities  if at all  to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable 
the use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present 
we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects  or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects 
in addition  a variety of factors  including geological and market related  can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical 
for example  if oil and natural gas prices are much lower after we complete a well than when we identified it as a prospect  the completed well may not yield commercially viable quantities 
our use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and expose us to risk of financial loss 
we enter into hedging transactions for our oil and natural gas production to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  primarily to protect against declines in prices 
our hedges at year end consisted of mainly natural gas price floors with strike prices lower than the period end prices 
our hedging transactions have also consisted of financially settled crude oil and natural gas forward sales contracts with major financial institutions as well as crude oil price floors 
we intend to continue to enter into these types of hedging transactions in the foreseeable future 
hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including if production is less than expected  the other party to the contract defaults on its obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
hedging transactions other than floors may limit the benefit we would have otherwise received from increases in the price for oil and natural gas 
additionally  hedging transactions other than floors may expose us to cash margin requirements 
we may have difficulty competing for oil and gas properties or supplies 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  competing with major integrated and independent energy companies for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as for the equipment  labor  and materials required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and technological resources substantially greater than ours 
the market for oil and gas properties is highly competitive and we may lack technological information or expertise available to other bidders 
we may incur higher costs or be unable to acquire and develop desirable properties at costs we consider reasonable because of this competition 
our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities  some of which are owned by others 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability  proximity  and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties 
the unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product  material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations 
federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and transport oil and natural gas 
governmental laws and regulations are costly and stringent  especially those relating to environmental protection 
our domestic exploration  production  and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations affect the costs  manner  and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in our efforts to comply 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several  strict liability for contamination resulting from spills  discharges  and releases of substances  including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
under such laws and regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination  including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operations 
changes in or additions to environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal  or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect our operations and financial position 
our operations outside of the united states could also be subject to similar foreign governmental controls and restrictions pertaining to protection of human health and the environment 
these controls and restrictions may include the need to acquire permits  prohibitions on drilling in certain environmentally sensitive areas  performance of investigatory or remedial actions for any releases of petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes caused by us or prior owners or operators  closure  and restoration of facility sites  and payment of penalties for violations of applicable laws and regulations 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may pertain to  among other things  financial results  capital expenditures  drilling activity  development activities  cost savings  production efforts and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  liquidity  regulatory matters  and competition 
such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan  future  estimate  expect  budget  predict  anticipate  projected  should  believe  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current plans  expectations  estimates  and assumptions  upon current market conditions  and upon engineering and geologic information available at this time  and is subject to change and to a number of risks and uncertainties  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are volatility in oil and natural gas prices  internationally or in the united states  availability of services and supplies  fluctuations of the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas  the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates  operating hazards  requirements for capital  general economic conditions  changes in geologic or engineering information  changes in market conditions  competition and government regulations  as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report and set forth from time to time in our other public reports  filings  and public statements 
also  because of the volatility in oil and gas prices and other factors  interim results are not necessarily indicative of those for a full year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility are expected to continue 
our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
o price floors at december   we had in place price floors in effect through the december contract month for natural gas  these cover a portion of our domestic natural gas production for january to december the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our natural gas price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our domestic natural gas production from january to december at december   we also had in place crude oil price floors in effect through the march contract month  which cover a portion of our domestic crude oil production for january to march the crude oil price floors cover notional volumes of  barrels  with a weighted average floor price of per barrel 
our crude oil price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our domestic crude oil production from january to march the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other current assets 
there are no additional cash outflows for these price floors  as the cash premium was paid at inception of the hedge 
the maximum loss that could be sustained from these price floors in would be their fair value at december  of million 
o new zealand gas contracts all of our gas production in new zealand is sold under long term  fixed price contracts denominated in new zealand dollars 
these contracts protect against price volatility  and our revenue from these contracts will vary only due to production fluctuations and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would reduce cash flows by less than million based on the december  level of borrowing 
income tax carryforwards 
we had significant federal and state net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards at december  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to these carryovers at december   as management estimates that it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully utilized before they expire except for a million valuation allowance against the capital loss carryforward  as detailed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in estimates caused by changes in oil and gas prices  production levels  capital expenditures  and other variables could impact the company s ability to utilize the carryover amounts 
if we are not able to use our carryforwards  our results of operations and cash flows will be negatively impacted 
financial instruments and debt maturities 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair values of our senior subordinated notes due were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectively 
based upon quoted market prices as of december   the fair value of our senior notes due was million  or of face value 
the carrying value of our senior subordinated notes due was million at december for both and the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currencies  most notably the new zealand dollar 
fluctuations in rates between the new zealand dollar and us dollar may impact our financial results from our new zealand subsidiaries since we have receivables  liabilities  natural gas and ngl sales contracts  and new zealand income tax calculations  all denominated in new zealand dollars 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand and because of this  our results of operations  cash flows and effective tax rate are impacted from fluctuations between the us dollar and the new zealand dollar 
customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
