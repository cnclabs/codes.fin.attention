item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
of the securities and exchange commission  requests that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by ciprico inc general management s discussion and analysis of ciprico s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of receivables and inventories 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
pursuant to this  in virtually all cases revenue is recognized upon shipment of products 
products sold are generally covered by a standard warranty for periods up to three years 
we accrue a warranty reserve within cost of sales for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
we estimate the costs to service our warranty obligations based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
in addition to the standard warranty offered with each product sale  we offer separate service contracts to our customers with varying levels of service 
revenue from the sale of these contract based service programs is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related agreement 
any other services provided such as professional services  technical training and out of warranty repair for customers are done a fee basis and revenue is recognized when these services are provided 
in  we will begin to offer certain of our developed technologies to customers under a software license arrangement 
we intend to account for these transactions under the applicable sections of statement of position software revenue recognition and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we did increase our allowance by approximately  when a key distributor filed for bankruptcy 
since many of our accounts receivable are with distributors  dealers and other resellers  many of which have thin profit margins and may be thinly capitalized  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost is determined using an average cost method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to reduce excess and obsolete inventory to estimated market value based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months or expected life of the representative product 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results warranty our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of each balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that our estimate is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we would increase our warranty accrual resulting in decreased gross profit 
similarly  if the opposite occurs and we experience better than expected results  we would decrease our warranty accrual 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
overview the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of ciprico inc should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are a leading provider of digital media workflow solutions 
our solutions combine storage  networking and computing solutions to simplify and accelerate digital media workflows 
our primary markets are content creation which includes applications in pre media and video  post production which includes applications in digital video production  broadcast and entertainment which include applications in digital cinema  broadcast and film and military and government which include applications involving the data capture  processing and dissemination of surveillance images 
the following table sets forth certain items from ciprico s consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of net sales for the years ending september net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations net sales there is a convergence in the marketplace as evidenced by customers involved in multiple stages of digital media workflows 
customers use our products in a variety of digital workflow applications including content creation  post production including digital film and video and digital broadcast 
because of this convergence it is increasingly difficult to define a certain market into which our solutions may be sold and in addition  more difficult to define a particular customer into a definitive market space 
for purposes of this analysis of our net sales we have separated sales into major categories broadcast sales of our products primarily to oem s that include our product in a larger application military government any product sold into this fairly well defined customer base content creation product sales to users of digital video and graphics customers comparative information on sales by market is shown in the charts below in millions market sales of total sales of total sales of total broadcast military government content creation other total sales for decreased from sales  which decreased from levels 
in january of the mediavault product line  principally sold into the content creation marketplace  was purchased from huge systems  inc we believe there is considerable growth in the content creation marketplace and that our solutions are designed to meet the specific needs of these customers 
we also believe that we have and are developing applications for the latter stages in the digital workflow process  including capture  management  archival and distribution of digital assets 
sales in the broadcast segment decreased in and in we believe the decreases in the last two years are the result of lost business from competitive effects at each of our largest broadcast oems and  to a lesser extent  the result of softer demand within the broadcast industry 
sales to our two largest oem s decreased over million from to sales in the military and government market decreased in versus in fiscal the decreases in the past two fiscal years reflect reduced spending levels from system integrators associated with defense related programs 
sales in the military segment are to some extent dependent upon the actual appropriation and funding of government programs that specify our products 
we believe our sales in this segment have been adversely impacted by delays in the deployment and funding of certain programs in which our products have been specified 
sales in the military segment have historically fluctuated between years due to the timing of spending on defense related programs 
sales of the netarray and legacy products decreased from million in to million in sales of both fibrestore and talon products decreased approximately from over of sales in came from the dimeda and mediavault family of products and we expect that this percentage will increase in we believe that our revenue growth in the future is dependent on our ability to provide new products and expand the applications of our products into targeted market segments  particularly digital video  digital broadcast and digital cinema 
from a strategic standpoint we believe that part of our future revenue streams may come from the license of our proprietary software 
in we did not sell software separately from our hardware 
however  beginning in fiscal we are making this an option for our customers 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was in  and in the decrease in can primarily be attributed to unfavorable overhead absorption due to lower unit volumes and the impact of a third quarter charge of  to cost of sales and inventory to reduce certain legacy products to market value 
the gross margin in was substantially affected by the addition of the mediavault product line through acquisition in january these products carry a slightly higher gross margin percentage than the other product lines 
gross profit on product sales is highly dependent on the cost of various components including disk drives and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we believe our strong vendor relations will aid in component availability and cost sensitivity 
we expect to experience continued competitive pressures on gross profit margins throughout fiscal we intend to partially offset these margin pressures through new product introductions and cost reductions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased approximately million or in compared to a decrease of million or in versus these decreases are primarily a result of decreased prototype spending on development projects  a continued shift towards software development activities and reduced staffing levels between years 
the decrease for would have been greater based on reduced staffing levels implemented in the second half of fiscal  however several people were added as a result of the purchase of the mediavault product line in january sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately million or versus a decrease of million or for compared to the reduction in both years reflects reduced headcount  resulting from our restructuring efforts implemented in each of the past three fiscal years 
the net decrease also takes into consideration the addition of headcount as part of the asset purchase in january the reduction in expenses during fiscal and also reflects reduced spending on trade show and promotional activities 
we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars during fiscal as a result of additional sales personnel being added in the past few months and an increase in trade show attendance 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased a net  from this net number is a result of many factors including the addition of the california facility and the other costs related to the acquisition  increased costs of regulation compliance  and increased costs of insurance offset by a reduction in personnel costs as a result of restructuring efforts implemented during the second quarter of and the third quarter of fiscal overall expenses decreased  in compared to fiscal as a result of the reduction in personnel costs tied to the restructuring efforts implemented during the third quarter of fiscal  a reduction in the allowance for bad debt and a reduction in legal expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal due to anticipated higher insurance costs and increased accounting and audit fees related to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
restructuring during both the second quarter of and the third quarter of  we implemented workforce reductions  the larger of which was the one in  a reduction in personnel 
as a result of the restructuring we recorded a charge of  related to employee termination costs 
in april a restructuring charge of million was recorded  of which approximately million was for employee termination costs   was related to a non cash charge to cost of sales for reducing certain legacy product inventory to market value  and million was related to the abandonment of a portion of ciprico s headquarter facility and the write down of certain fixed assets 
due to the sublease of the abandoned space in december and the additional mitigation of other costs associated with previous restructuring charges   of earlier restructuring charges were reversed in fiscal we do not anticipate any further restructuring efforts in the near future 
other income other income of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  is primarily attributable to interest income on cash and marketable securities 
the increase for  despite lower principal balances is the result of overall higher market interest rates and active management of the investments 
income tax expense for fiscal and  no income tax benefit was recognized  as we do not expect to realize any current income tax benefits 
the effective income tax expense was in and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had a total of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and asset backed short term investments of million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the september  amount of million includes million which is classified as non current as it matures in fiscal  however it could be available for company use with minimal cost 
cash flows used in operating activities were million   and million in   and  respectively 
the use of cash in all years reflects the net loss and the impacts of depreciation and changes in working capital 
the change in total cash and investments between and relates to the cash flow to support the net loss  change in working capital and million of cash paid out as part of the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of huge systems  inc in january capital expenditures were   and million in   and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures and related expenses for product development activities in will approximate  some of our development work may become reimbursable via non recurring engineering fees we anticipate receiving from certain customers 
there were no shares repurchased in fiscal or during  we repurchased  shares at a total cost of approximately  the total amount authorized to be expended under the stock buyback program is million 
this program is currently suspended 
as of september  and   shares of common stock had been repurchased for million 
despite the cost reduction efforts implemented during and  we are uncertain as to when we can expect to return to profitability due to the lack of any ability to forecast sales in our markets and continued investments expected in new product development 
we are dependent on a substantial increase in sales to be able to achieve profitability 
we believe that current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund requirements for operating losses  working capital and capital expenditures  as well as any potential acquisitions in fiscal as of september   we have lease commitments  including base rents and operating costs  on our corporate headquarters of about  for each of the next two years 
the lease contains a buy out clause  which would allow us to leave the premises in october of for a fee of  the lease expires in october of we have a sublease in place with a third party for part of this space through october of which provides us with sublease income of approximately  per year for the next two years 
our lease commitments for our california office only go through june at a monthly gross rent of approximately  new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have added disclosure related to using the fair value method to evaluate stock based employee compensation
