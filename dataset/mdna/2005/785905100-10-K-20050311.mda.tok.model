in  approximately of our revenue was generated from sabre travel network  from travelocity and from sabre airline solutions based on segment results that include intersegment revenues 
compared to the year ago period  revenues including intersegment revenue for the twelve months ended december  decreased for sabre travel network  while revenues increased for travelocity and for sabre airline solutions 
business 
we operate our business through the following business segments sabre travel network our sabre travel network segment markets and distributes travel related products and services through the travel agency and corporate channels 
travel agencies  both online and brick and mortar  subscribe to our services

for business travelers  travelocity business provides the integrated online corporate travel technology and full service offering of our getthere product along with the online expertise of travelocity 
sabre airline solutions sabre airline solutions is a global leader in providing passenger management solutions  software products and related services  and consulting services to help airlines simplify operations and lower costs 
over airlines worldwide use one or more products in sabre airline solutions portfolio to increase revenues and improve operations 
more than airlines worldwide rely on sabre airline solutions for its airline reservation suite products  with nine new carriers added and four carrier renewals in for our sabresonic passenger reservations product suite 
in addition  more than clients worldwide have turned to sabre airline solutions consulting group for strategic  commercial and operational consulting 
during the fourth quarter of we realigned our getthere business segment  which engaged in business direct travel services and had previously been operated as a separate business segment  within our other three segments 
this realignment resulted in getthere products  services and operations being integrated into the remaining three segments 
accordingly  getthere is no longer reported as a separate segment 
business trends potential effects of the following trends  events and uncertainties are discussed in risk factors 
increased travel booking volumes through our channels 
during the twelve months ended december   we experienced increased travel bookings through all of our channels 
we attribute this year over year increase in bookings to improved demand for travel services as compared to we believe that a significant portion of this improvement results from travel demand having been depressed in because of traveler concerns about the war in iraq and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
during  booking volumes through our sabre travel network business segment improved as a result of the rebound in travel demand 
the table below details the year over year percentage increases in sabre travel network booking volumes for the year ended december  twelve months ended december  year over year increase air bookings total bookings united states global factors influencing the travel industry  particularly airlines 
our revenues are highly dependent on the travel and transportation industries  and particularly on airlines 
most of our revenue is derived from airlines  hotel operators  car rental companies  cruise operators  and other suppliers in the travel and transportation industries 
our revenue increases and decreases with the level of travel and transportation transactions processed by our systems 
consequently  our revenues are highly subject to declines in or disruptions to travel and transportation due to factors entirely out of our control  such as the recent tsunami that devastated large parts of southeast asia 
in addition  we depend on a relatively small number of major airlines for a significant portion of our revenues 
several of these airlines are experiencing financial difficulty  some including united air lines  inc  us airways  inc and ata holdings corporation have sought bankruptcy protection and still others may consider bankruptcy relief 
see risk factors our revenues are highly dependent supplier efforts to control travel distribution 
airlines have been working aggressively for several years to divert travel bookings away from gds networks and towards alternative travel distribution channels  including websites that they control and online travel agencies that book directly with those airlines 
see risk factors some travel suppliers are seeking alternative distribution models the efforts of suppliers to divert bookings away from independent distributors such as online and conventional travel agencies using our sabre gds towards supplier direct booking channels such as supplier controlled websites and call centers is referred to as channel shift 
over the last eighteen months  we have experienced a slowing in the rate of channel shift  which we attribute partly to our current pricing options for suppliers  discussed below  and partly due to a rebound in corporate travel 
the slowing of channel shift is an encouraging indicator  but it is not clear if this pattern will continue over the long term 
during the third quarter of  northwest airlines  inc northwest implemented a fare supplement for travel reservation bookings made through a gds by traditional travel agencies and online travel sites including travelocity 
in response to northwest s announcement  sabre travel network filed a lawsuit against northwest for noncompliance with its participating carrier distribution and services agreement with us 
sabre travel network also implemented a series of actions under its fare parity policy  in order to cause northwest to honor its contract to provide fare parity for users of the sabre gds 
northwest countersued us the following day 
on september   northwest discontinued the fare supplement  and sabre travel network discontinued application of its fare parity policy to northwest 
see part i item legal proceedings 
competition and consolidation 
the marketplace for travel distribution is intensely competitive 
we routinely face new competitors and new methods of travel distribution 
suppliers and third parties seek to create distribution systems that book directly with travel suppliers at a reduced cost 
many of these alternative travel distribution channels are in start up or developing mode  are well financed and have yet to fully define their functionality and costs 
these new travel distribution technologies may contribute to channel shift 
see supplier efforts to control travel distribution  above 
in addition  a new breed of competitors is entering the travel marketplace 
both established and start up search engine companies are attempting to enter the travel marketplace by leveraging search technology to aggregate travel search results across supplier  travel agent and other websites 
these search engines and alternative travel distribution channels pose a threat to our businesses as they may have the effect of diverting customers from our online sites and our sabre gds  putting pressure on our revenues  pricing and operating margins 
we also face consolidation among suppliers  travel marketing and distribution competitors  and online and conventional travel agencies  which may offer them negotiating leverage and other advantages of scale 
see risk factors we face competition and risk competition pricing options for suppliers 
to ensure that our customers had access to the most comprehensive airline fares  in and we introduced alternative booking fee pricing options  such as the direct connect availability dca year pricing option  to airlines that participate in the sabre gds 
see item business associate participation and pricing options 
through the dca year pricing option  for example  participating airlines committed to the highest level of participation in the sabre system for three years 
our dca year pricing option agreements were a first step in preparation for being a leader in a deregulated industry by giving us access to virtually all of a carrier s content  eliminating fare confusion in the marketplace 
see risk factors travel suppliers are seeking to bypass with the recent deregulation of the gds industry  we have new flexibility to price our services based upon a variety of factors 
we have already implemented new pricing models for some suppliers 
see item business computer reservation system industry regulation 
for example  during the second quarter of  we completed two opt in agreements with international carriers that are generally similar to our dca year pricing option agreements 
see item business associate participation and pricing options 
we are also evaluating various other options for pricing our services to suppliers 
pricing options might be offered to airlines according to their operational needs  such as pricing that varies with the volume of an airline s bookings through the sabre gds or pricing that differs between long haul or short haul trips 
we will offer airlines a choice of multiple pricing schedules 
our goal with any new models will be to match our pricing programs with the value that we provide to suppliers while maintaining a neutral impact to the average unit revenue in the sabre travel network business 
our goal is to have these new models  and corresponding new agreements with many airlines  in place before the expiration of our dca year pricing option agreements in and see risk factors adverse changes in or interruptions to changing our sabre travel network business model 
we are also taking actions to both strengthen our core sabre gds business with enhanced content and capabilities and to take advantage of the opportunities available in merchandising as we benefit from the insight we gain from having travel distribution and travel marketing assets in one integrated portfolio although the vast majority of our travel distribution revenues are derived from booking fees paid by travel suppliers  we recently entered into agreements that do not follow this traditional business model  and we are evaluating the desirability of more of these agreements 
for example  in we entered into an agreement in which we charge a transaction fee to the travel agency rather than a booking fee to the travel supplier 
during  we enhanced our competitive position by reducing our operating expenses 
see cost reductions and expense savings below 
in  we further developed our jurni network consortium  a leisure travel agency consortium that combines a preferred sales network and consolidated purchasing power with technology driven marketing tools to sell preferred travel offerings 
our nexion host agency offering provides ticketing  operations  fulfillment support and marketing services for all travel bookings  allowing its travel professional members to focus on selling travel 
during  nexion became the largest fully automated host agency in the united states 
in  we rolled out several new features for our jurni network offering  including the new jurni custom trip packaging capabilities from travelocity  agent which incorporates last minute travel offerings from sitecom  and jurnicruise which provides automated shopping and booking capability for cruises 
all of the features are available to jurni network consortium agents in our internetview point of sale tool 
during the first quarter of  we also introduced assured vantage  a new program for small to medium sized travel agencies that offers more agency friendly contract terms  reducing the risk of traditional booking volume shortfalls  and a new structured incentive schedule that we expect will result in a slowing of the incentive growth rate 
during the third quarter of  we introduced the sabre hotel spotlight program 
sabre hotel spotlight offers premium marketing opportunities to hoteliers through the sabre gds 
in we launched our new mysabre web based agent booking portal which provides agents and suppliers with new merchandising opportunities at the point of sale 
in january of  we acquired synxis corporation  which provides snyxis reservation management  distribution and technology services to approximately  hotel properties  to further expand the range of services we offer to hotels 
investments in travelocity 
the development of travelocity continues to be a strategic focus for us 
for example  during the second quarter of  we launched a new technology platform travelocity totaltrip sm to enable the marketing of higher margin packaging products 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we implemented a complete rebranding and redesign of travelocity s website  offering consumers greater ease of use 
we are also investing in developing products and segments that we believe offer rapid growth opportunities  such as in the business direct segment and online distribution in europe and asia 
for example in the third quarter of  travelocity business launched enhanced technologies in its service center that integrate and automate the corporate travel reservation process from beginning to end 
during the third quarter of  travelocity introduced its merchant model hotel platform in europe on travelocity 
co 
uk and will continue to expand the program into its other european operations in the near future 
in the third quarter of  travelocity acquired las vegas based all state tours inc  allstate ticketing a leading distributor of show tickets and tours in the entertainment capital of the world 
as part of the purchase  travelocity acquired the allstate ticketing brand and the showtickets 
com sm website 
in october of  travelocity acquired sole control of the non german operations of travelocity europe by purchasing the interest in the joint venture s non german operations owned by the otto group s otto freizeit und touristik gmbh otto 
although we anticipate that this acquisition will require additional investment and be dilutive over the short term  by gaining full control over the non german operations of travelocity europe  we believe we can accelerate its growth by introducing travelocity s industry leading capabilities  including dynamic packaging  our advanced merchant hotel program and revolutionary site designs 
travelocity and otto plan to continue their joint ownership of the german operations of travelocity europe 
on january   travelocity entered into a put option agreement pursuant to which it may gain control of of zuji holdings limited zuji  a joint venture operating in the asia pacific region 
see financial statements and supplementary data subsequent events note zuji agreement 
cost reductions and expense savings 
in the fourth quarter of  we began implementing plans to enhance our competitive position by reducing our operating expenses and better aligning expenses with revenue targets 
through these initiatives  we realized over million in cost savings in further  as part of our cost leadership strategy we are  as a standard practice  evaluating efficiency opportunities across the company to ensure that we optimally manage our operational costs 
some of these cost saving opportunities may involve globally sourcing some of our operations either by contracting with companies that work for us or by expanding our own operations abroad 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to reduce our operating expenses throughout computer reservation system industry regulation 
aspects of our travel marketing and distribution businesses are subject to the computer reservation systems crs regulations in the european union  canada and peru 
these regulations generally govern gds services for airlines and travel agencies  but not for non airline suppliers except rail suppliers in limited circumstances 
among the topics addressed in some of the current regulations are no preferencing crs displays based upon airline identity  equal treatment of airlines by the crss  equal participation by airlines that have an ownership interest in a crs  and limits on travel agency contract terms 
all crs regulations promulgated by the us department of transportation that were applicable in the united states expired on july  we believe that this deregulation in the united states will enhance our opportunities to creatively market airline services and freely negotiate with travel agencies 
however  deregulation also presents challenges associated with maintaining participation levels in the sabre gds by travel suppliers who are no longer subject to equal participation regulations 
transport canada issued final rules on may   eliminating all crs regulations in canada except rules prohibiting screen preference and discrimination in providing the right to participate in service enhancements 
in addition  regulators in the european commission are reviewing their crs regulations for possible changes  which may include some level of deregulation 
it is not clear whether or when any amendments in the european union will take effect nor what form they may take 
the potential effects of these trends  events and uncertainties are discussed below under risk factors

financial results the following table presents operating results for the three years ended december   and in thousands of dollars 
the segment revenues and cost of revenues are shown including intersegment activity 
we have included the elimination of intersegment activity below to agree to the results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements year ended december  segment revenues sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    subtotal segment revenues    elimination of intersegment revenues    total    cost of revenues sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    corporate    subtotal segment cost of revenues    elimination of intersegment expenses    total    gross profit sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    corporate    total    selling  general and administrative sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    corporate   total    amortization of acquired intangibles sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    total    operating income loss sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    corporate    total    results of operations total revenues of  million for the year ended december  were million  or higher than revenues of  million for the year ended december  cost of revenues of  million for the year ended december  were million or lower than the cost of revenues of  million for the year ended december  these reported revenues and expenses are net of intersegment revenues and expenses which were eliminated in consolidation 
management s discussion and analysis of revenues and cost of revenues by business segment are based upon the information contained in the above table  where segment results include intersegment revenues and cost of revenues of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were to third parties  that is  at estimated current market prices 
the majority of the intersegment revenues and cost of revenues are between travelocity and sabre travel network  consisting mainly of incentives paid by sabre travel network to travelocity for bookings made through the sabre gds  data processing fees paid by travelocity to sabre travel network  and fees paid by sabre travel network and sabre airline solutions for corporate and airline trips booked through travelocity s online booking technology 
all intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues have been eliminated in consolidation 
disaggregated results by segment are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
the compounded annual growth rate of revenues by segment for the three years ended december  was a reduction of for sabre travel network  and growth of for travelocity and for sabre airline solutions 
each of our business segments was negatively affected by the september  terrorist attacks  and the resulting decline in the us economy in general and the travel industry in particular 
other macroeconomic factors that negatively impacted our business during this period included the war and continued conflict in iraq  ongoing travel security concerns  and fear of potential terrorist attacks and sars 
these negative impacts to the general economy and the travel industry specifically negatively impacted each of our business segments  with the most pronounced effect being on sabre travel network  where revenues remained below revenue levels 
the combination of an economic downturn  travel security concerns and channel shift has resulted in a compounded decrease in annual bookings processed through the sabre system since we have also seen continued pressure on sabre travel network revenues resulting from travel bookings being diverted from independent gds channels toward supplier controlled channels  individual airline websites and call centers  as well as various other travel distribution websites on the internet 
we believe that the discounted pricing agreements such as the dca year pricing option agreements are helping to slow the effects of channel shift from the sabre system  but these types of agreements have also lowered our effective yield on bookings 
for the three years ended december   travelocity has experienced compounded annual growth in revenues due to the growth in bookings made through our websites and contact centers  and increased yields stimulated by increased merchant hotel activity and improved packaging of offerings 
although travelocity was negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above and by declining internet advertising revenue  the growth in the internet travel business combined with travelocity merchant model and packaging initiatives offset the negative impacts 
sabre airline solutions has experienced compounded annual growth in revenues for the three years ended december  although sabre airline solutions and its customers were negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above  we were able to grow revenues in each of the past two years 
this increase in revenues during a turbulent time for the airline industry is the result of increased sales of decision support products and services and web enabled solutions that offer cost savings and more efficient operations to our customers 
additionally  this increase was driven by growth in airline reservation hosting revenues 
expenses 
our primary operating expenses consist of salaries  benefits  other employee related costs  data processing costs  communication costs  advertising and customer incentives  representing approximately  and of total operating expenses in  and  respectively 
since  we have realized a compounded decrease in our operating expenses of approximately 
these decreases reflect reduced amortization expense resulting from goodwill no longer being amortized beginning in and lower operating costs in each business unit achieved through the eds contract 
sabre travel network hardware and communications costs have decreased as a result of the migration to lower cost solutions and the adoption of third party solutions by subscribers 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in sabre travel network technology spending due to the phased implementation and continuing expansion of new functionality that requires running legacy systems as well as the new technology  and increases in sabre travel network customer incentives due to competitive pressures on renewals and conversions 
travelocity cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses have increased due to growth in the business 
we increased our expenditures for advertising in order to drive additional travelers to travelocity s websites  and expenses have increased as a result of increases in transaction volumes for our merchant offerings 
our technology infrastructure related expenses have also increased in order to support our growth and new offerings 
sabre airline solutions operating expenses have generally grown at a rate commensurate with the growth in revenues during the to period although bad debt expense increased significantly in due to the economic state of the airline industry and the bankruptcy filings of several key customers 
compared to total revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to approximately  million 
management s discussion and analysis of revenues and cost of revenues by business segment are based upon segment results including intersegment revenues and cost of revenues of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were to third parties  that is  at estimated current market prices 
the majority of the intersegment revenues and cost of revenues are between travelocity and sabre travel network  consisting mainly of incentives for travelocity bookings made through the sabre gds  data processing fees paid by travelocity to sabre travel network  and fees paid by sabre travel network for corporate trips booked through travelocity s online booking technology 
all intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues have been eliminated in consolidation 
disaggregated results by segment are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
total revenues including intersegment revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
the increase in total revenues reflects improved travel demand and travel bookings in we believe that revenues in each of our segments were adversely affected by a decline in travel resulting from several factors that occurred during this period  including unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  political and economic instability abroad resulting in part from the war in iraq and its aftermath  ongoing travel security concerns due to the continued conflict in iraq  fear of potential terrorist attacks  and travelers fear of exposure to contagious diseases such as sars 
sabre travel network revenues decreased million or  from  million in to  million in booking fees from suppliers and transaction fees from certain subscribers increased by million 
this million increase includes a million improvement resulting from higher booking volumes partially associated with travel demand having been depressed in because of traveler concerns about the war in iraq and sars offset by a million decrease due to a lower effective average rate per booking 
this average rate per booking decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of discounted pricing options such as the dca year pricing option 
total worldwide travel bookings processed through the sabre system  which include direct bookings and joint venture bookings for which we or our distribution partners earn a booking fee  were million for the year ended december   an increase of from million bookings in non transaction fee subscriber revenue decreased by million  driven by million of settlement revenue recognized in derived from two canceled subscriber contracts 
the remaining decrease in non transaction fee subscriber revenue of million reflects the trend towards the adoption of third party equipment solutions by our subscribers 
other revenues increased by million compared to  driven primarily by a million increase in equity income and transaction processing revenue from our joint ventures and a million increase in corporate booking revenue resulting from higher corporate booking volumes 
in addition  other revenue increased approximately million due to the introduction of our sabre hotel spotlight program during the third quarter of the remaining million increase relates to other revenue increases associated with various products 
travelocity revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
transaction revenue increased million or  primarily driven by a million increase in non air transaction revenue including revenue resulting from sales of package offerings that include air travel as a component and a million increase in stand alone air transaction revenue 
the million increase in non air transaction revenue consisted primarily of the following stand alone hotel revenue growth of million due to the growth of our merchant model hotel offering and due to increased hotel bookings through our world choice travel wct affiliate network  which we acquired in november packaged trip revenue increased approximately million due to growth in our travelocity totaltrip sm offering launched in june and volume growth in our last minute deals  net transaction revenue increased million due to a reduction in our merchant supplier liability 
in  we implemented a process to write off any supplier liabilities greater than six months old from the travel date 
based on recent trends  we estimate that approximately million of the million relates to travel prior to december  which would be recognized six months following the travel date under our new process see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  all other non air transaction revenue increased million which includes the impact of the allstate acquisition  which we completed on august  the million increase in stand alone air transaction revenue was primarily due to a volume increase in stand alone air ticket sales compared to our volume increased due to an overall increase in online travel demand 
non transaction revenue decreased million  or  consisting of the following we recognized revenue of approximately million in related to the warrants received from a former hotel supplier 
our contract with the supplier terminated in september see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these warrants 
joint venture equity method losses  which reduce our revenues  increased by approximately million 
the increased equity method losses result from increased spending on marketing by the joint ventures  the expansion of our former european joint venture into france and the acquisition of travelchannel ltd  a leading german online travel website  whose operating results increased the equity losses for our joint venture in europe 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accounting policies for our joint ventures and the acquisition of the non german operations of travelocity europe 
corporate revenue  the fees paid by sabre travel network and sabre airline solutions to travelocity for trips booked through travelocity s online booking technology  increased by approximately million due to higher volumes  and all other non transaction revenue decreased million 
sabre airline solutions revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase was driven primarily by a million increase in airline reservation hosting revenue 
this million increase includes million due to a shift towards online bookings for our customers and the sale of enhanced functionality to our existing hosted carrier base 
the remaining million is driven by increased transaction fees due to newly signed carriers and organic growth from our existing customers 
airline consulting services revenues increased million due to a higher number of customer engagements 
these increases were offset by an million decrease in development labor revenues and a million decrease in software products and services revenue driven by an elongated sales cycle 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues including intersegment cost of revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network cost of revenues decreased million or  from  million to  million 
the primary drivers of this change were a million decrease in headcount related expenses resulting from workforce reductions and a million decrease in technology spending 
other cost of revenue expenses for sabre travel network decreased million  but were offset by a million increase in subscriber support costs 
the million decrease in technology related spending is due to a million reduction in operational costs related to our phased implementation of new  lower cost pricing and shopping functionality 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase related to the continued expansion of this new functionality  which required us to operate legacy systems as well as the new systems and a million increase in other technology spending 
the million increase in subscriber support costs includes a million increase in customer incentives  partially offset by million of reductions in hardware support and communications costs 
the increase in customer incentives includes million related to increased booking activity in  million resulting from increases in the average incentive per booking driven by competitive pressure on renewals and conversions  and million related to incentive payments to travelocity due to improved booking volumes 
the million reduction in hardware support and communications costs are driven by migration to lower cost solutions and the adoption of third party solutions by subscribers 
travelocity cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million 
expenses related to our merchant model offerings increased million due primarily to volume growth which is referenced above in the explanation for the increase in transaction revenue 
however  expenses related to our merchant model offerings also increased due to the fact that in  we incurred credit card fees  merchant credit card chargebacks  fraud charges and other expenses that we did not incur at similar levels in due to our relationship with a third party supplier of merchant hotel content  which was terminated in september data processing expenses increased by approximately million due to higher booking volumes and other cost of revenue expenses increased approximately million 
these increases were offset by approximately million of savings resulting from our contact center operations agreement with wns see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sabre airline solutions cost of revenues decreased approximately million or  from million to million 
this decrease was driven by reduced direct headcount related expenses of million and a million reduction in indirect headcount related expenses driven by a year over year change in the allocation of corporate resources offset by a corresponding increase in sabre airlines solutions selling  general and administrative expenses below 
these decreases were offset by increases in travel expenses of approximately million partly due to the recognition of invoiced travel as revenue beginning in as opposed to an offset to cost of revenue in prior periods 
data processing expenses increased million related to internet booking engine volumes 
services purchased increased million to support reservations hosting implementations and consulting engagements and development labor increased million due to growth in web hosting related revenues 
other cost of revenue expenses increased million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million or  as compared to the year ended december   from million to million due to increases for travelocity and sabre airline solutions offset by an million decrease in general and administrative costs at the corporate level due to facilities consolidation charges that we incurred in that we did not incur in sabre travel network selling  general and administrative expenses for sabre travel network decreased by million driven primarily by a million decrease in services purchased  which were higher in due to our efforts as an advocate for the deregulation of the us crs industry 
this decrease was offset by an increase in bad debt reserves of million resulting from the increased aging of receivables due from a few large customers 
other selling  general and administrative expenses for sabre travel network increased million 
travelocity travelocity s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  primarily due to increased advertising and customer acquisition costs of million to drive additional travelers to our websites 
the increase also includes payments to our wct affiliates but is offset partially by savings from the aol agreement renegotiation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other selling  general and administrative expense increases for travelocity include million driven by higher corporate allocations  million in services purchased  million in direct headcount related expenses and other increases totaling million 
sabre airline solutions selling  general and administrative expenses for sabre airline solutions increased million 
this increase was driven by a million increase in bad debt expense attributable to the economic state of the airline industry and the bankruptcy filings of several key customers 
in addition  indirect headcount related expenses increased million driven by a year over year change in the allocation of corporate resources offset by a corresponding decrease in sabre airline solutions cost of revenues above 
direct headcount related expenses and development labor increased million 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of approximately million as compared to the year ended december  sabre travel network amortization increased approximately million primarily due to a million impairment write down of technology related intangible assets in and a million increase resulting from the acquisition of the remaining of dillon communications systems gmbh in december travelocity amortization decreased by approximately million due to an approximately million write off in of an intangible asset resulting from the termination of an agreement with a former hotel supplier in also  there was an million decrease due to the completion of amortization of intangible assets during and  partially offset by approximately million of increased amortization resulting from the acquisition of assets of wct in the fourth quarter of and the acquisition of all state tours in the third quarter of amortization expense related to our fourth quarter acquisition of the non german operations of teu was insignificant 
amortization of intangible assets for sabre airline solutions increased approximately million resulting from several small acquisitions during interest income 
interest income decreased approximately million for the year ended december  from million to million due primarily to lower average balances of certain short term investments and loans receivable 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million for the year ended december  from million to million resulting from the capital lease we entered into at the end of june for our headquarters buildings 
other  net 
other  net changed approximately million from net other expense of approximately million for the year ended december  to net other income of approximately million for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to the million loss we incurred in relating to the required residual value guarantee payment in connection with terminating our syndicated lease facility and entering into a capital lease facility for our corporate headquarters

cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to approximately  million 
management s discussion and analysis of revenues and cost of revenues by business segment are based upon segment results including intersegment revenues and cost of revenues of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were to third parties  that is  at estimated current market prices 
the majority of the intersegment revenues and cost of revenues are between travelocity and sabre travel network  consisting mainly of incentives and marketing fees for travelocity bookings made through the sabre gds  data processing fees paid by travelocity to sabre travel network  and fees paid by sabre travel network for corporate trips booked through travelocity s online booking technology 
all intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues have been eliminated in consolidation 
disaggregated results by segment are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
total revenues including intersegment revenues for the year ended december  were flat compared to the year ended december   increasing approximately million from  million to  million 
we believe that revenues in each of our segments were adversely affected by a decline in travel resulting from several factors that occurred during this period  including unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  political and economic instability abroad such as the war in iraq and its aftermath  ongoing travel security concerns due to the continued conflict in iraq  fear of potential terrorist attacks  and travelers fear of exposure to contagious diseases such as sars 
sabre travel network revenues decreased million or  from  million in to  million in booking and other fees from associates decreased by million due to economic conditions in the united states  the ongoing travel security concerns discussed above and channel shift 
this million decrease includes a million reduction due to lower volumes  partially offset by a million increase attributable to the overall net increase in average rate per booking  which is partially offset by the impact of dca year pricing option 
total worldwide travel bookings processed through the sabre system  which include direct connect bookings and joint venture bookings for which we or our distribution partners earn a booking fee  were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million bookings in booking volumes have not recovered to the levels we experienced prior to additionally  bookings made under the dca year pricing option agreements were at a discount of approximately from rates 
the effect on revenues from the decreases in booking volumes were partially offset by a increase in the average price per booking charged to air associates during  notwithstanding the impact of dca year pricing option 
subscriber revenue increased by million  driven by million of settlements related to two canceled subscriber contracts 
offsetting these settlements was a million decrease in subscriber revenue driven primarily by a declining base of equipment leased to subscribers

travelocity revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
transaction revenue increased million or  primarily driven by a million increase in non air transaction revenue including revenue resulting from sales of merchant model and package offerings and a million increase in stand alone air transaction revenue

the increase in stand alone air transaction revenue was primarily due to a service fee implemented on january  for most stand alone air tickets  partially offset by the growth in air tickets sold as part of packaged sales which increased significantly and is included in non air transaction revenues 
non transaction revenue decreased million  or  consisting of the following we recognized revenue of approximately million due to the termination of our affiliation with a former hotel supplier 
this revenue was related to the warrants received from the former hotel supplier pursuant to this affiliation that had previously been deferred and was being recognized over the term of the affiliation agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these warrants 
advertising revenues decreased million primarily due to a decrease in advertising revenue from aol 
the recognition of net losses from our equity investments in joint ventures resulted in a million decrease 
these net losses from joint ventures relate to our investments in joint ventures for the establishment of online travel reservation sites in the far east and europe 
these joint ventures began operations during and losses in were in line with expectations as we continue investment in these markets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accounting policies for our joint ventures 
all other non transaction revenues decreased by approximately million driven by reduced fees to handle paper tickets resulting from increased usage of electronic tickets  partially offset by an increase in fees for ticket reissues and offline services 
sabre airline solutions revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase was driven primarily by a million increase in revenues from decision support products and services provided to various travel providers 
key components of this increase included revenues from a large resource management contract and growth in the emergo offering  which is a web enabled application service provider asp product line 
in addition  airline reservation hosting revenue improved million due to an increase in the number of signed carriers as well as transaction fees linked to an increase in passenger volumes on existing airline customers 
revenues from airline consulting services improved million due to additional service offerings that we acquired during the fourth quarter of these increases were offset by an million decrease in development revenues from major customers as those airlines slowed purchases to reduce costs during the industry downturn

the million reduction in hardware support and communications costs are driven by migration to lower cost solutions and the adoption of third party solutions by subscribers 
travelocity cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in development labor of million resulting from a decline in demand for development labor because of reduced spending by airlines 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million or  compared to the year ended december  from million to million 
the increase is primarily due to higher travelocity advertising costs of million to drive additional travelers to our websites and a million increase in travelocity payments to distribution partners 
corporate facilities costs increased approximately million as a result of the facilities consolidation in these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in travelocity salaries and benefits primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense

other selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million 
amortization of intangible assets

interest income 
interest income decreased in excess of million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to lower average rates of return on our portfolio of cash and marketable securities investment accounts  as well as slightly lower average balances held in these investments 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million or  from million to million 
this increase was primarily due to an approximately million increase in interest expense resulting from the capital lease on our headquarters buildings  partially offset by a million decrease resulting from lower interest rates on our libor based interest rate swaps 
other  net 
other  net decreased million from other income of million to other expense of million  from to other  net during was primarily due to an million gain from the sale of our former corporate headquarters building  a million gain realized from the sale of france telecom formerly equant nv shares and other investment gains of million  partially offset by million in write downs of investments in companies developing emerging travel technologies 
during we incurred a million loss relating to the required residual value guarantee payment in connection with terminating our syndicated lease facility 
we also realized a million loss on the sale of a building during other changes include insignificant year over year changes in net income allocated to minority interests 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for was approximately  which varies from the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to foreign tax credits that we claimed related to joint venture activities accounted for under the equity method and for which the offsetting foreign tax expense was recorded in pre tax income 
this reduction in the tax rate was partially offset by additional state income taxes 
our effective tax rate for of varied from the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes 
net earnings 
in  travel demand dropped significantly due to a slow economy  the war in iraq and sars 
these factors coupled with higher customer incentive and advertising costs resulted in a million or decrease in net earnings for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  invest in our products and offerings  pay dividends  complete share repurchases and service our debt and other long term liabilities 
although our primary source of funds has been from our operations  we have occasionally raised external funds through the sale of stock and debt in the capital markets and through privately negotiated transactions 
in assessing our liquidity  key components include our net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items  and current assets and liabilities  in particular accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued expenses 
for the long term  our debt and long term liabilities are also considered key to assessing our liquidity 
our future minimum non cancelable contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands of dollars payments due by year contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years notes payable      capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations     it outsourcing agreement    aol agreement   yahoo agreement   wns agreement      pension and other benefit obligations    other long term obligations     amounts receivable under non cancelable subleases   total contractual cash obligations    includes all interest and principal related to million unsecured notes

consists primarily of minimum payments due under various marketing agreements 
also  includes a note payable and related interest owed to a joint venture partner 
eds subleases an office facility from us in fort worth  texas  that will expire in in the near term  we anticipate that cash flows from our operations  existing balances in cash and short term investments of million as of december  and funds available under our revolving credit facility of up to million will be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures which include operating expenses  capital expenditures  investments in our products and offerings  interest payments on our debt  dividends and share repurchases 
in the long term  we expect to use our existing funds and cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt and other long term obligations 
we may also use our funds to retire debt as appropriate  based upon market conditions and our desired liquidity and capital structure 
we may also consider using our funds available or possibly external sources of funds for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies when such opportunities become available 
these types of additional activities might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
risk factors that could possibly affect the availability of our internally generated funds include  among other things reduced sales due to declining booking volumes and lower prices under discount pricing programs such as the dca year pricing option  diversion of bookings away from our channel offerings and other competitive pressures  and changes in our working capital 
see risk factors for a more complete discussion of risk factors that might affect the availability of our internally generated funds 
nonetheless  with our strong cash and short term investments position of million and working capital of million as of december   along with our investment grade credit ratings from s p and moody s of bbb and baa  respectively  we have significant resources available to us and we continue to implement cost controlling efforts to ensure our operating expenses are in line with the impacts of the factors listed above and other risk factors 
cash investments we generally invest excess cash in highly liquid instruments  including high credit quality money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  banker s acceptances  commercial paper  repurchase agreements  mortgage backed and receivables backed securities and corporate and government notes  including tax exempt municipal securities 
we try to invest all of our excess cash in marketable securities 
therefore  our annual investments will fluctuate depending on the levels of cash provided or used by all of our other investing  operating and financing activities 
capital activities dividends 
we began paying a quarterly dividend of 
per share during the second quarter of  and paid dividends of the same amount during the third and fourth quarters of resulting in total dividend payments for of million

financing arrangements revolving credit agreement 
on june   we replaced a million revolving credit agreement that was set to expire on september   with a new million  senior unsecured revolving credit agreement that expires june  under certain conditions  we can request an additional million under this new agreement

as of december   we are in compliance with all covenant requirements under this agreement 
sabre inc  a owned subsidiary of sabre holdings corporation  unconditionally guarantees all debt obligations of sabre holdings corporation under the notes 
in conjunction with these notes  we have entered into two interest rate swaps through for a total of million  which pay us and on which we pay a variable rate based on a six month libor plus basis points 
capital lease obligation 
in june  we entered into a ten year master lease for our corporate headquarters facility in southlake  texas  which is accounted for as a capital lease 
the interest rate on the capital lease financing is fixed at 
at the inception of the lease  we recorded an asset of approximately million  along with a liability of approximately million  representing the present value of the minimum lease payments due under the lease and the residual value guarantee discussed below 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to terminate the lease and purchase the properties for approximately million  plus a make whole amount  if applicable 
we also have the option at any time up to one year prior to lease expiration to cause the properties to be sold 
if this sell option is exercised  we have guaranteed that proceeds on a sale will be at least approximately million  and we are responsible for the first dollar loss up to approximately million due to a decrease in the value of the property below approximately million 
if the sales proceeds exceed approximately million plus any sales related expenses  we retain the excess 
in conjunction with this lease  we have entered into a million interest rate swap which pays us and on which we pay a variable rate based on a six month libor plus basis points

cash flows from operating activities increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ago period 
this year over year increase was primarily due to improved earnings and favorable changes in working capital 
net earnings including adjustments for non cash and non operating items improved million 
favorable changes in working capital included the collection of million related to the cancellation of two subscriber contracts and million in expedited collections in our merchant model due to changing service providers 
these positive changes in working capital were offset by million in other working capital changes primarily due to timing differences in accruals and payments 
cash provided by operating activities during year ended december  was million  which was primarily from net earnings of million adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities includes favorable changes in working capital 
non cash adjustments to net earnings of million were driven primarily by depreciation and amortization of million  bad debt expense of million  equity losses in unconsolidated joint ventures of million and stock compensation expense of million  offset by deferred taxes of million 
the favorable changes in working capital include an increase in merchant supplier liabilities of approximately million  a reduction in accounts receivable in due to the collection of million related to the cancellations of two subscriber contracts  the receipt of approximately million in of dividends from our sabre travel network unconsolidated joint ventures and lower prepaid expenses  net of amortization of million related to the renegotiation of our contract with aol

non cash and non operating adjustments to net earnings of million for the year ended december  included depreciation and amortization of million  stock compensation expense of million  deferred income taxes of million  a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of million and bad debt expense of million 
these expenses were offset by joint venture equity income of million and a gain on sale of assets of million related to the sale of our former corporate headquarter facilities 
investing activities 
the million decrease in cash used for investing activities in the year ended december  as compared to the year ago period primarily results from an million net increase in sales of marketable securities for our short term investment portfolio 
the net increase in sales of marketable securities is partially offset by million in investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and million in loans to business partners during the year ended december  compared to a net use of million for similar activities in the same period a year ago 
in addition  during the year ended december  we utilized million  net of cash acquired  for acquisitions compared to million in investing activities declined million between and the reduction resulted from a use of cash of million for acquisitions  net of cash received  in  primarily for the acquisition of travelocity 
com  compared to million in additionally  in net purchases of short term marketable securities was million compared to net sales of short term marketable securities of million in financing activities 
the million increase in cash used for financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to dividends of million paid in compared to million for and million used to repurchase our common stock during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in as compared to increased million due to a generally higher stock price 
in  million was used related to the termination of our syndicated lease facility on our headquarters buildings

these proceeds were offset by common stock repurchases of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships or agreements as of december  that would be considered an off balance sheet arrangement as defined by item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we adopt and follow certain accounting policies 
certain amounts presented in the financial statements have been determined based upon estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ 
we have included below a discussion of the accounting policies involving material estimates and assumptions that we believe are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements  how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with our audit committee 
although we believe these policies to be the most critical  other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses each of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition sabre travel network we record revenue for airline travel reservations processed through the sabresystem at the time of the booking of the reservation 
however  if the booking is canceled in a later month  the booking fee must be refunded to the customer less a small cancellation fee 
therefore we record revenue net of an estimated amount reserved to account for future cancellations 
this reserve is calculated based on historical cancellation rates 
in estimating the amount of future cancellations that will require us to refund a booking fee  we assume that a significant percentage of cancellations are followed by an immediate re booking  without loss of revenue 
this assumption is based on historical rates of cancellations re bookings and has a significant impact on the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected cancellation rates or changes in booking behavior  our estimates of future cancellations could be increased by a material amount and our revenue decreased by a corresponding amount 
at both december  and  our booking fee cancellation reserves were approximately million 
in  the cancellation reserve remained the same due to increasing booking levels offset by a reduced rate per booking 
this reserve is sensitive to changes in booking levels and the number of bookings priced under the terms of the dca year pricing option agreements 
for example  if booking volumes had been lower or the weighted average booking fee rate had been lower  the reserve balance would have been reduced by approximately million 
travelocity we receive commissions from travel suppliers for air travel  hotel rooms  car rentals  vacation packages and cruises booked through our travelocity websites and advertising revenues from the delivery of advertising impressions on our travelocity websites 
commissions from air travel providers are recognized at the time of booking the reservation  net of cancellations for the period 
commissions from car and hotel travel providers are recognized upon the scheduled date of travel consumption 
we estimate cancellations  including no shows  for car and hotel commissions and record these revenues net of an estimated reserve 
if circumstances should change such that the cancellation rates are significantly higher than expected  it could have a significant impact on the amount reserved 
at december  our reserve for car and hotel commissions was approximately million 
for our travelocity merchant hotel and totaltrip offerings  we record merchant revenues based on the total amount paid by the customer for products and services  minus our payment the travel supplier 
we recognize merchant revenue for stand alone air travel at the time the travel is marketed to the consumer and for vacation packages and hotel stays at the date of check in 
sabre airline solutions our software is generally sold as part of agreements which also require us to provide customization and implementation services 
such agreements are accounted for using contract accounting under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue from license fees  when software is sold without associated customization or implementation services  is recognized when the software is delivered  fees are fixed and determinable  no undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered software and collection is probable 
at times  determining if all of these elements have been met requires judgment 
fees for software maintenance are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
the fees for software maintenance included in initial software license agreements is based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the services determined using actual renewal rates for software maintenance services 
the process of allocating fees based on vendor specific evidence of fair value can require judgment 
accounts receivable we generate a significant portion of our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from services provided to commercial airlines 
as of december   approximately of our trade accounts receivable were attributable to these customers 
our other accounts receivable are generally due from other participants in the travel and transportation industry 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  failure to pay amounts due to us or others  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past write off history average percentage of receivables written off historically and the length of time the receivables are past due 
several of our airline customers are experiencing financial difficulty  some including united air lines  inc  us airways  inc 
and ata holdings corporation have sought bankruptcy protection and still others may consider bankruptcy relief 
we believe that we have appropriately considered the effects of these factors  as well as any other known customer liquidity issues  on the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
however  if demand for commercial air travel softens  due to prevailing economic conditions  terrorist acts  war or other incidents involving commercial air transport  or other factors  the financial condition of our customers may be adversely impacted 
business combinations during  and  we completed a number of acquisitions of other companies using the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with these acquisitions were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
the fair values were determined by our management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent appraisal experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
in connection with these acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets  including goodwill 
goodwill and long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or if impairment indicators exist 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  as generally estimated using a discounted future net cash flow projection  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
we evaluate four reporting units under sfas  which include sabre travel network  travelocity  sabre airline solutions and emerging businesses 
our emerging businesses reporting unit is included with sabre travel network for segment reporting purposes 
the fair values used in our sfas evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections 
these cash flow projections are based upon a number of assumptions  including risk adjusted discount rates  future booking and transaction volume levels  future price levels  rates of growth in our consumer and corporate direct booking businesses and rates of increase in operating expenses 
we believe that the assumptions we have made in projecting future cash flows for the evaluations described above are reasonable 
however  if future actual results do not meet our expectations  we may be required to record an impairment charge  the amount of which could be material to our results of operations 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist for an amortizable intangible asset  the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if our projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset  no impairment charge is recorded 
if our projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the intangible asset to its fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million on technology related assets 
in  we wrote off an intangible asset of approximately million associated with a supplier agreement that was terminated early 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million associated with a customer contract 
no other significant impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets have been recorded 
income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves significant judgment and evaluation of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
as a result  we have established reserves for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
tax reserves are reviewed regularly pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for contingencies 
tax reserves are adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes and associated interest  such as the expiration of statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  identification of additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  or the issuance of statutory or administrative guidance or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue 
accordingly  we may experience significant changes in our tax reserves in the future if or when such events occur 
seasonality the travel industry is seasonal in nature 
bookings  and our revenues for the use of the sabre system  decrease significantly each year in the fourth quarter  primarily in december 
customers generally book their november and december holiday leisure travel earlier in the year  and business travel declines during the holiday season 
travelocity revenues are also impacted by the seasonality of travel bookings  but to a lesser extent since commissions from car and hotel travel providers and merchant revenue for vacation packages and hotel stays are recognized upon date of consumption 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for other items impacting our quarterly results

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement was applicable prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb modified fin to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen 
fin provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
we do not have an interest in any entity that is required to be consolidated pursuant to the provisions of fin we completed an initial evaluation of and continue to monitor our involvement in other entities  including joint ventures and other investments pursuant to the provisions of fin  and have determined that none of these entities are required to be consolidated under fin in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the standard requires companies that issue certain types of freestanding financial instruments to treat them as liabilities on their balance sheet  measured at fair value  even though the instruments have characteristics of equity 
generally this standard is effective for the interim period beginning july  currently  we do not have any financial instruments that are impacted by the new standard 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

sab s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s related revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers issued with sab no 
that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab no 
remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab  which was effective upon issuance 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
effective july   we adopted financial accounting standard board staff position fsp no 
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of act 
this fsp provided guidance on the accounting for the effects of the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits  and requires employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  fas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
fas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in statement however  fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  we expect to adopt fas r on july  and we intend to use the modified prospective method 
we currently account for share based payments using apb s intrinsic value method whereby we generally recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
fas r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under the current guidance 
the impact of the adoption of fas r cannot be predicted at this time as it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the statement amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions by replacing the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have a commercial substance 
we anticipate that adoption of this statement will not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations

sabre holdings corporation cautionary statement statements in this report which are not purely historical facts or which necessarily depend upon future events  including statements regarding our anticipations  beliefs  expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies for the future  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all forward looking statements in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
any forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
risk factors risks associated with an investment in our securities  and with achieving the forward looking statements contained in this report or in our news releases  websites  public filings  investor and analyst conferences or elsewhere  include  but are not limited to  the risk factors described below 
any of the risk factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not succeed in addressing these challenges and risks 
our revenues are highly dependent on the travel and transportation industries  and particularly on airlines  and a prolonged substantial decrease in travel bookings volumes could adversely affect us 
most of our revenue is derived from airlines  hotel operators  car rental companies  cruise operators and other suppliers in the travel and transportation industries 
our revenue increases and decreases with the level of travel and transportation activity and is therefore highly subject to declines in or disruptions to travel and transportation due to factors entirely out of our control 
the travel industry is seasonal and our revenue varies significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors that may adversely affect travel and transportation activity include economic downturns and recessions  global security issues  political instability  acts of terrorism  hostilities and war  increased airport security that could reduce the convenience of air travel  inclement weather  such as the recent tsunami which devastated large parts of southeast asia  increased occurrence of travel related accidents  travelers concerns about exposure to contagious diseases such as sars or avian bird flu  economic and political issues in the middle east  asia  latin america and elsewhere  and the financial condition of travel suppliers 
the possibility of further terrorist attacks  hostilities and war  the resulting security measures at airports  and the financial instability of many of the air carriers may continue to adversely affect the travel industry 
airlines may reduce the number of their flights  making fewer offerings available to us 
we depend on a relatively small number of airlines for a significant portion of our revenues 
several major airlines are experiencing liquidity problems  some including united air lines  inc  us airways  inc  and ata holdings corporation have sought bankruptcy protection and still others may consider bankruptcy relief 
travelers perceptions of passenger security or airlines financial stability may have an adverse effect on demand 
the financial instability of airlines or a prolonged substantial decrease in travel bookings volumes could have an adverse impact on our financial performance  operations  liquidity  or capital resources and could impair our ability to recover the carrying value of certain of our assets  including capitalized software  other intangible assets and goodwill 
we will also encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced in rapidly evolving industries such as the travel industry  and particularly the online travel industry 
some of these risks relate to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost effective basis  expand and enhance our service offerings  operate  support  expand and develop our operations  our websites  our software and our communications and other systems  diversify our sources of revenue  including by entering into agreements that may reflect changes to our sabre gds business model  maintain and develop our existing brands and distribution channels  as well as to make cost effective expenditures in connection with these initiatives  manage our relationships with important travel suppliers and other industry participants  manage litigation  including our current litigation with northwest  and respond to competitive market conditions 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy  our business  financial condition or results of operations may suffer 
we face competition from established and emerging travel distribution channels  risks related to deregulation of the crs industry and possible internal channel conflict  which could divert customers to our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business includes channels of distribution that support the travel agency  business direct and consumer direct segments of the global travel distribution market 
in all of these distribution channels  we face significant competition 
in the travel agency channel  our sabre gds competes primarily against other large and well established global distribution systems  but new gds alternatives are also being promoted in the marketplace 
with the deregulation of the crs industry in the united states  our crs business will be competing in a free market system 
our current and potential customers may elect to use a competing gds or a gds alternative offering lower prices 
furthermore  one or more airlines other than those participating in our dca year pricing option may elect to discontinue or to lower their levels of participation in the sabre gds 
losing access to inventory from one or more major suppliers would make the sabre gds less attractive to travel agencies and travel purchasers  which could reduce our booking fee revenue 
in order to gain access to suppliers inventory including suppliers for whom dca year pricing option contracts will be expiring in and  it might become necessary for us to reduce further the fees charged to suppliers  which could reduce our booking fee revenue 
in addition  we face increasing competition in the travel agency channel from travel suppliers that distribute directly to travel agencies as well as to consumers 
in the business direct channel  travelocity business and our sabre travel network s getthere product compete against similar offerings from other travel agencies 
some competitors market business travel systems that are bundled with financial and other non travel software systems that we do not offer 
as a result  our current and potential customers may choose the convenience or cost effectiveness of our competitors bundled products and services  which may increase the pricing pressure on our getthere offerings 
in the consumer direct channel  our travelocity offering competes not only against similar offerings from affiliates of other global distribution systems  but also with travel suppliers  online vertical search engines  and a large number of online travel agencies 
our sabre airline solutions business unit competes against several organizations offering internal reservation system and related technology services to airlines 
this segment is highly competitive 
if we cannot compete effectively to keep and grow this segment of business  we risk losing customers and economies of scale  which could have a negative impact on our operating results 
we expect existing competitors  business partners and new entrants to the travel business to constantly revise and improve their business models in response to challenges from competing businesses  including ours 
if these or other travel industry participants introduce changes or developments that we cannot meet in a timely or cost effective manner  our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  consumers frequently use our websites for route pricing and other travel information  and then choose to purchase travel offerings from a source other than our website  including travel suppliers own websites 
such use may increase our costs without producing revenue 
in addition  consolidation among our competitors may give our competitors increased negotiating leverage with travel suppliers and greater marketing resources  thereby providing corresponding competitive advantages over us 
consolidation among travel suppliers  including airline mergers  may increase competition from distribution channels related to those suppliers and place more leverage in the hands of those suppliers to negotiate lower booking fees 
if we are unable to compete effectively  competitors could divert our customers away from our travel distribution channels and  unless we substitute alternative revenue streams  it could adversely affect our results of operations 
in certain limited circumstances  our business segments may conflict with each other 
for example  both our travelocity 
com and travelocity business websites may compete with the travel agency customers of sabre travel network to distribute travel to corporate or business customers 
although we believe that our participation in both the traveler direct and distribution intermediary businesses is a distinct advantage for sabre holdings due to synergies including greater scale of our technology  customer conflicts between our offerings across businesses could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  such conflict could cause some of our current or potential travel agency customers to consider competing gds providers or online websites or other direct or indirect channels of travel distribution 
some travel suppliers are seeking alternative distribution models  and alternative models of travel distribution are emerging  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
some travel suppliers are seeking to decrease their reliance on distribution intermediaries  including global distribution systems such as our sabre gds 
travel suppliers may give advantages to distribution intermediaries in which they have an economic stake or may create or expand commercial relationships with online and traditional travel agencies that work with travel suppliers to directly book travel with those suppliers 
many airlines  hotels  car rental companies and cruise operators have established their own travel distribution websites 
several suppliers have formed joint ventures that offer multi supplier travel distribution websites 
from time to time  travel suppliers offer advantages  such as bonus miles  lower transaction fees  or discounted prices  when their products and services are purchased from these supplier related websites 
some of these offerings are not available to unrelated intermediaries  or those intermediaries must provide lower distribution pricing in exchange for access to the offerings 
in addition  the airline industry has experienced a shift in segment share from full service carriers to low price carriers 
some low cost carriers do not distribute their tickets through the sabre gds or through other third party intermediaries 
in addition  a new breed of competitors is entering the online travel marketplace 
both well established search engine companies as well as start ups are attempting to enter the online travel marketplace by leveraging search technology to aggregate travel search results across supplier  travel agent and other travel related websites 
these search engines and alternative travel distribution channels have the potential to divert customers from our online sites and our sabre gds thereby putting pressure on our revenues  pricing and operating margins 
see business trends supplier efforts to control travel distribution and item business the sabre global distribution system associate participation and pricing options 
adverse changes in or interruptions to our relationships with travel suppliers could affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenues 
we rely on participating carrier agreements  such as our dca year pricing option  with our airline suppliers  and these agreements contain terms that reduce our revenues by providing discounted pricing 
none of these arrangements is exclusive and airline suppliers could enter into  and in some cases may have entered into  similar agreements with our competitors 
in addition  most of the agreements we have with airline suppliers will expire by their terms within the next two years unless they are extended or replaced 
see item business the sabre global distribution system associate participation and pricing options 
we cannot assure you that our arrangements with travel suppliers will remain in effect  that the net impact of these pricing options will not adversely impact revenue  or that any of these suppliers will continue to supply us with the same level of access to inventory of travel offerings in the future 
additionally  we cannot assure you that potential disputes with our travel suppliers such as our litigation with northwest airlines will not affect our businesses 
see item legal proceedings 
because our major airline relationships represent such a large part of our business  the loss of any of our major airline relationships  including due to the bankruptcy of an airline  could have a material negative impact on our business 
if our access to inventory or features is affected  or our ability to offer their inventory on comparatively favorable economic terms is diminished  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
consolidation in the travel industry and increased competition for travel agency subscribers may result in increased expenses  lost bookings and reduced revenue 
gdss compete to attract and retain travel agencies 
the number of bookings produced by our travel agency subscriber base is an important factor in our success 
some travel suppliers have reduced or eliminated commissions paid to travel agencies including consumer direct travel sites like travelocity 
the loss of commissions causes travel agencies to become more dependent on other sources of revenues  such as traveler paid service fees and gds paid incentives 
the reduction or elimination of supplier paid commissions has forced some smaller travel agencies to close or to combine with larger travel agencies 
although the sabre gds has a leading share of large travel agencies  competition is particularly intense among global distribution systems for larger travel agency subscribers 
consolidation of travel agencies may result in increased competition for these subscribers 
in order to compete effectively  we may need to increase incentives  pre pay incentives  increase spending on marketing or product development  or make significant investments to purchase strategic assets 
in addition  consolidation among travel suppliers  such as major hotels and airline mergers and alliances  may increase competition from these supplier related distribution channels or give them additional leverage to negotiate lower booking fees payable to gds operators like sabre travel network 
see item business competition 
travelocity s growth cannot be assured 
the online travel marketplace is highly competitive  with both independent online travel agencies and suppliers proprietary websites competing for customers 
our business strategy is dependent on expanding travelocity s transaction revenues  increasing its percentage of merchant transactions  maintaining the breadth of its merchant suppliers  developing its brand in a cost effective manner and increasing its site traffic including direct distribution as well as through current and future distribution partners 
key components of this strategy include the growth of revenue from our merchant model hotel business  last minute packaging and the totaltrip dynamic packaging offering 
we also plan to expand the appeal of travelocity business to corporate travelers and to invest strategically in growth opportunities such as the european and asian marketplaces 
if any of these initiatives is not successful  travelocity s growth may be limited and it may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  travelocity s growth strategy relies on the continuing growth in the travel industry of the internet as a distribution channel 
if consumers do not continue to book more travel online than they currently do today or if the use of the internet as a medium of commerce for travel bookings does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  our revenues and profit may be adversely affected 
our business plans call for the significant growth of our net rate hotel and packaging businesses  and we may be unsuccessful in managing or expanding that business 
our business strategy is dependent upon what is commonly referred to in the industry as our merchant model business  primarily our net rate hotel program  as a significant source of revenue growth and increased margins 
our net rate hotel strategy is particularly dependent upon our ability to obtain the right to market adequate hotel rooms 
we remain subject to numerous risks in the operation and growth of the merchant model business 
in particular  we cannot ensure that we will continue to be successful in adding and retaining hotel properties or other suppliers in a sufficient number of domestic or international geographic markets 
many hoteliers utilize merchant model arrangements with us and with our competitors as a channel to dispose of excess hotel rooms at discounted rates 
demand for supplier offerings may increase as a result of increased travel and competition from merchant model offerings by our competitors 
if demand increases for suppliers products  services and other content offerings  suppliers may limit our right to market their offerings or may increase the cost of those offerings 
these types of events could exert downward pressure on the margins we expect to achieve in our merchant hotel business 
we may be unable to achieve our financial objectives for the merchant model hotel program  especially if economic conditions improve or if competition increases 
similar risks could also impact any future merchant model programs we might explore for other types of supplier offerings  such as air travel 
we may be unsuccessful in pursuing and integrating business combinations  strategic alliances  or products and technologies  which could result in increased expenditures or cause us to fail to achieve anticipated cost savings or revenue growth 
we are currently seeking to integrate the completed acquisitions described herein  including our acquisitions of the non german operations of travelocity europe and of synxis corporation 
in addition  we plan to continue to examine possible business combinations  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies in order to maintain and grow revenue and market presence 
as a result of these completed or proposed transactions  our businesses will be subject to new or increased risks related to the nature of the transactions 
we may be unable to successfully complete potential acquisitions due to multiple factors  such as issues related to regulatory review of the proposed transactions 
in addition  there are risks inherent in these types of transactions  such as difficulty in assimilating or integrating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  disruption of our ongoing business  including loss of management focus on existing businesses and marketplace developments  problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  expenses associated with the amortization of identifiable intangible assets  additional or unanticipated operating losses  expenses or liabilities of acquired businesses  impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners  and fluctuations in value and losses that may arise from equity investments 
in addition  we may not be able to identify suitable candidates for additional business combinations and strategic investments  obtain financing on acceptable terms for such business combinations and strategic investments  or otherwise consummate such business combinations and strategic investments on acceptable terms 
to consummate such transactions  we may need to raise external funds through the sale of stock and or debt in the capital markets or through private placements  which might affect our liquidity requirements 
we are not certain that our ongoing cost reduction plans will continue to be successful 
our strategy depends  to a substantial degree  on reducing and controlling operating expenses 
in furtherance of this strategy  we have engaged in ongoing  company wide activities intended to reduce costs 
these activities include personnel reductions  reductions in personnel related costs  programs designed to reduce the growth rate of incentive payments to travel agencies  and realigning and streamlining operations and consolidating facilities 
we cannot assure you that our efforts will continue to result in the increased profitability  cost savings or other benefits that we expect 
part of our cost reduction strategy involves leveraging our status as a global company to conduct some of our operations outside the united states  such as customer call centers and software development  either by contracting with foreign companies that work for us or by expanding our own operations outside the united states 
these foreign operations are subject to unique risks  including business  political and economic instability in foreign locations  governments policies that could adversely affect business and economic conditions related to our operations or business  adverse political or consumer reactions in the united states  disruptions to communication and transportation services supporting globalization  actual or threatened terrorist activities  and military action overseas 
risks such as these could adversely affect our ability to effectively implement global sourcing 
rapid technological changes and new distribution channels or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may adversely affect the value of our current or future technologies to us and our customers  which could cause us to increase expenditures to upgrade and protect our technology or develop and protect competing offerings in new distribution channels 
new distribution channels and technology in our industry are evolving rapidly 
our ability to compete and our future results depend in part on our continued ability to maintain and to make timely and cost effective enhancements  upgrades and additions to our technology in response to changes in consumer preferences and increased demand for our products and services 
we must also keep pace with rapid advancements in industry technology  standards and practices  and protect our technology 
additionally  we must maintain our ability to ensure the security and privacy of personal information transmitted through our websites and other distribution channels 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on us  and our legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages to our business caused by such use 
protecting our intellectual property from unauthorized use could be expensive and time consuming 
maintaining flexibility to respond to technological and market dynamics or to respond to evolving security and privacy requirements may require substantial expenditures and lead time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify and develop new products or services in a timely manner  that offerings  technologies or services developed by others will not render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive  or that the technologies in which we focus our research and development investments will achieve acceptance in the marketplace and provide a return on our investment 
our systems may suffer failures  capacity constraints and business interruptions  which could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose customers 
our businesses are largely dependent on the computer data centers and network systems operated for us by electronic data systems corporation and on the global telecommunications infrastructure 
we rely on several communications service suppliers and on the global internet to provide network access between our computer data center and call centers and end users of our services 
travelocity and site are dependent upon gds s the sabre gds and a third party provider  respectively to process their travel bookings 
we occasionally experience system interruptions that make some or all of our global distribution system or other data processing services unavailable  which may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers or other third parties and which could result in a material adverse effect upon our businesses  financial condition or results of operations particularly if such events occur at travelocity 
system capacity limits or constraints arising from unexpected increases in our volume of business could cause interruptions  outages or delays in our services  or a deterioration in their performance  or could impair our ability to process transactions 
much of the computer and communications hardware upon which we depend is located in a single facility 
our systems might be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquakes  terrorist attacks  hostilities or war or similar events 
computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions affecting the global internet or our systems might cause service interruptions  delays and loss of critical data  and could prevent us from providing our services 
problems affecting our systems might be expensive to remedy and could significantly diminish our reputation and brand name and prevent us from providing services 
we could be harmed by outages in  or unreliability of  the data center or network systems 
our success depends on maintaining the integrity of  and upgrading the quality of  our systems and infrastructure 
in order to be successful  we must provide reliable  real time access to our systems for our customers and suppliers while also pursuing a low cost model 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers and travel suppliers enhanced products  services  features and functionality all while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure and while pursuing the lowest cost per transaction 
the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 
consumers and suppliers will not tolerate a service hampered by slow delivery times  unreliable service levels  service outages due to the installation of upgrades  or insufficient capacity  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation  conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 
in our processing of travel transactions  we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data 
this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world  including the commission of the european union eu commission through its data protection directive and variations of that directive in the member states of the european union eu 
this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected  processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 
we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september  in the united states  government agencies have been contemplating or developing initiatives to enhance national and aviation security  including the transportation security administration s computer assisted passenger prescreening system  known as capps ii 
these initiatives may result in conflicting legal requirements with respect to data handling 
as privacy and data protection has become a more sensitive issue  we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data 
travel businesses have also been subjected to investigations  lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information 
these and other privacy developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
state and local tax issues have the potential to have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
some state and local taxing authorities impose taxes on the sale  use or occupancy of hotel room accommodations  which are called transient  occupancy  accommodation  sales or hotel room taxes 
hotel operators generally collect and remit these occupancy taxes 
consistent with that practice  when a customer books a net rate  or merchant  hotel room through one of our travel services  we collect from the customer an amount sufficient to pay the hotel its room charge and the occupancy taxes on that charge  as well as additional amounts representing our fees 
we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes on our fees 
some tax authorities claim that occupancy taxes should be collected on some or all of the fees 
we believe there are strong arguments that our fees are not subject to occupancy taxes although tax laws vary among the jurisdictions 
we are attempting to resolve this issue with tax authorities in various jurisdictions  but we cannot predict the resolution in any particular jurisdiction 
we have established a reserve for potential occupancy tax liability  consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances 
the reserve represents our best estimate of our contingent liability for occupancy taxes 
a variety of factors could affect any actual liability for occupancy taxes  such as the number of jurisdictions that prevail in either assessing additional occupancy taxes or negotiating a settlement with us  the fees potentially subject to tax in each jurisdiction  changes in applicable tax laws  and the timing of any or all of the foregoing 
the amount of our liability on occupancy taxes could exceed that reserve  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
regulatory developments abroad could limit our ability to compete by restricting our flexibility to respond to competitive conditions  which could cause our customers to be diverted to our competitors and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
the eu commission is engaged in a comprehensive review of its rules governing crs systems 
it is unclear when the eu commission will complete its review and what changes  if any  will be made to its crs rules 
we could be unfairly and adversely affected if  for example  these rules are retained as to traditional global distribution systems used by travel agencies but are not applied to travel distribution websites owned by more than one airline 
we could also be adversely affected if restrictions are imposed or continued on crs advertising and displays or if additional limitations are placed upon our right to contract with travel agents or airlines 
we could also be adversely affected if changes to any of the foregoing crs rules increase our cost of doing business or weaken the non discriminatory participation rules to allow one or more large airlines owning a competing crs to discontinue or to lower its level of participation in our global distribution system 
our international operations are subject to other risks  which may impede our ability to grow internationally and adversely affect our overall results of operations 
we continually seek to expand the reach of our various businesses into international markets as well as to successfully integrate  operate and manage our existing and future international operations 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including  but not limited to  the following changes in foreign currency exchange rates competition from local businesses  which may have a better understanding of  and ability to focus on  local consumers and their preferences  as well as more established local brand recognition and better access to local financial and strategic resources  difficulty in developing  managing and staffing international operations as a result of distance  language and cultural differences  local economic and political conditions  including conditions resulting from the existing and potential conflicts in the middle east and the damage resulting from the tsunami that devastated large parts southeast asia  restrictive governmental actions  such as consumer and trade protection measures  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  including to foreign tax laws  limitations on the repatriation of funds  lesser protection in some jurisdictions for our intellectual property  and laws and policies of the us affecting trade  foreign investment and loans 
these risks may adversely affect our ability to conduct and grow business internationally  which could cause us to increase expenditures and costs  decrease our revenue growth or both

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our marketable securities portfolio 
largely offsetting this exposure are our notes payable and capital lease obligation  as hedged with fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
the objectives of our marketable securities are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as such  our investment portfolio consists primarily of high credit quality certificates of deposit  money market mutual funds  bankers acceptances  commercial paper  repurchase agreements  mortgage backed and receivables backed securities and corporate and government notes  including tax exempt municipal securities 
if short term interest rates average lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would decrease by approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if short term interest rates averaged lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would have decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our average marketable securities invested during and in addition  we had fixed rate senior notes of million notes outstanding as of december  we have entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps related to million of the outstanding notes  effectively converting million of the million fixed rate notes into floating rate obligations 
if short term interest rates average higher in than they were in  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our floating rate swap notional value of million at december  in addition  we had a million capital lease at december  we have entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps related to million of the outstanding capital lease  effectively converting million of the million fixed rate capital lease into a floating rate obligation 
if short term interest rates average higher in than they were in  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our floating rate swap notional value of million at december  foreign currency risk we have various operations outside of the united states  primarily in north america  south america  europe  australia and asia 
as a result of these business activities  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
because a significant portion of our business is transacted in the united states dollar  these exposures have historically related to a small portion of our overall operations 
nevertheless  during times of devaluation of the us dollar  such as in and  the increase in our foreign expenses can have a negative impact on our operating results 
to reduce the impact of this earnings volatility  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts on our three largest foreign currency exposures 
these forward contracts  totaling million at december  and million at december   represent obligations to purchase foreign currencies at a predetermined exchange rate  to fund a portion of our expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
in march we also hedged a portion of our foreign currency exposure using call option contracts  which gave us the right to purchase foreign currencies at predetermined exchange rates to fund a portion of our expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
as of december   there were no call option contracts outstanding 
in december  we purchased foreign currency denominated government bonds to function as a hedge of a portion of our foreign currency exposure 
to protect these bond investments from foreign currency risk  we purchased put options on the currencies in which the government bonds are denominated 
these options give us the right to sell the foreign currencies at predetermined prices 
the result of an immediate percent devaluation of the us dollar in from december  levels relative to our primary foreign currency exposures would result in a negative us dollar impact of approximately million in  net of hedge instruments outstanding 
this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projections of our primary foreign currency denominated expenses and foreign currency forwards and foreign currency denominated bonds outstanding as of december  management s report on the assessment of internal controls the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f and d f under the securities exchange act of the company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company s management and board of directors regarding the reliability  preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
