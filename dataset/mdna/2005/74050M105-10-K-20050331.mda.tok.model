financial information appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with that reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is designed to assist readers of the consolidated financial statements in understanding significant changes in premier s financial condition and results of operations 
management s objective of a fair presentation of financial information is achieved through a system of internal accounting controls

forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth or lack thereof  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
see also note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this annual report 
allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill as required by applicable accounting guidance  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company s balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of the company s banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company s aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company s aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management s impairment analysis 
realization of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets for the company primarily relate to the allowance for loan losses and net operating loss carryforwards 
in considering the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized  management considers the amount of previously paid taxes that may be recoverable and the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize expected future tax deductions 
at december  management s consideration of the need for a valuation allowance focused on the generation of future taxable income as all available previously paid taxes were recovered from the operating loss reported in in determining the likelihood of generating future taxable income management considered unusual events that have impacted the company s historical earnings and whether these events will recur  the company s operating budget and likely operating results in the near term 
changes in these assumptions could impact the carrying value of deferred tax assets and require a charge to tax expense 
significant event arising in on june   premier announced that as a result of an ongoing internal investigation it had uncovered a systematic disregard for its loan approval and credit administration policies at its wholly owned subsidiary farmers deposit bank and had accepted the resignation of the bank s president 
on june   senior management of premier received from the bank s former president a request to charge off over million in loans 
concerned about the magnitude of the request and the impact on premier s financial results  premier management promptly notified the federal reserve bank of cleveland and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic about the request 
premier s initial investigation indicated that the former president of farmers deposit had engaged in conduct which subverted the bank s internal controls and credit administration policies  conduct which appears to have been designed to avoid detection by management and those entities employed by premier to perform independent reviews of its subsidiaries accounting records  internal controls  and credit risk 
as a result of the ongoing investigation into the conduct of the former president of farmers deposit by premier and the fdic  premier charged off over million of loans 
the resulting depletion of the allowance for loan losses together with the current analysis of additional risk in the loan portfolio warranted significant additional provisions for loan losses at the bank 
in addition to the provision for loan losses  interest income reversals and other non interest expenses  including bad check write offs and loan review expenses  were recorded 
premier s management  with the assistance of outside independent professionals  conducted a further review of those loans for which significant charge offs or additional provisions were required in the purpose of the review was to determine if the facts or circumstances that gave rise to the additional charge offs or provisions had been improperly withheld from senior management or improperly considered in applying management s estimates and judgments as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in prior financial statement periods 
the review did identify instances in which collateral securing loans had been released without proper support or notation in loan files  instances in which obligors on notes had been released from their repayment obligation without proper support or notation in loan files and instances in which delinquent loan reporting systems had been manipulated to prevent problem loans from being identified on a timely basis 
premier s senior management determined that if these circumstances had been considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in prior periods then some of the loan charge offs and additional provisions for loan losses recorded in should have been reflected in prior periods 
therefore  in  the financial statements for and were restated to reflect the financial statement effect of the matters that occurred in those periods but which were improperly concealed by subsidiary management 
the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating the information disclosed in premier s june and july  forms k and the june  and september  forms q regarding farmers deposit and has requested information about premier s investigation 
premier is cooperating with the sec 
summary financial results premier had net income from continuing operations of million in compared to a million net loss from continuing operations reported for the year net income in is primarily the result of the continued earnings of premier s profitable banks partially offset by expenses associated with rehabilitating its subsidiary  farmers deposit bank  conducting premier s own investigation  cooperating with the sec investigation  and reducing debt at the holding company 
the loss for is primarily due to large provisions for loan losses and bad check losses at farmers deposit bank 
the loss in follows a million loss in which was due to large provisions for loan losses  writedowns of repossessed real estate to realizable values  and higher collection costs 
basic earnings per share from continuing operations was in  compared to a loss of in  and a loss of in the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years 
return on average assets roa measures how effectively premier utilizes its assets to produce net income 
premier s net income in resulted in an roa of  an increase over the net loss roa in and the net loss roa reported in as shown in the table  fully taxable equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets has remained fairly consistent over the past five years with a high of in the net losses in and were primarily the result of an increase in the provision for loan losses  resulting in negative net credit income for those years 
in  net credit income was once again positive  achieving the highest level over the five year period 
this increase in net credit income as a percent of average earning assets was dampened somewhat by higher non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets when compared to the previous four years 
as illustrated in the table  premier s fully taxable net interest income as a percent of average earning assets was down slightly to from the recorded in as interest earned on loans declined slightly due to a lower balance of loans outstanding and lower yields on loans due to the interest rate environment 
however  during the same time  net credit income increased as the provision for loan losses was of average earning assets in compared to in the net overhead ratio non interest expense less non interest income as a percent of average earning assets increased in to compared to in  the lowest ratio reported in the five years presented in the table 
the ratio declined from a net overhead ratio reported in the increase in net overhead was the result of increases in non interest expense related to the investigation of farmers deposit bank  the loss on the sale of facilities formerly leased to citizens bank which was sold in  and accelerated amortization costs related to the early redemption of premier s trust preferred securities 
the decline in compared to was the result of increases in non interest income related to service charges on deposit accounts 
in  this trend continued  as non interest income increased again due to revenue from service charges on deposit accounts

on february   the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell citizens bank in a cash transaction valued at approximately  which was completed on july  
the sale of this subsidiary helped to restore the financial position of premier after the impact of the losses sustained at farmers deposit bank during the second and third quarters of as a result of the sale  regulatory capital ratios of premier were restored to the stronger levels management wishes to maintain  cash reserves of the holding company were replenished  a portion of the cash reserves were used to reduce outstanding debt by million  and the profit from the sale allowed premier to utilize a substantial portion of its federal income tax net operating loss carryforward 
in premier suspended its acquisition strategy in order to focus on improving its subsidiary bank operations by strengthening its management oversight 
as part of this change in strategy  premier elected to dispose of two of its subsidiary banks in on january   the company disposed of all the deposits approximately million  the majority of loans approximately million and the premises and equipment approximately million of the bank of mt 
vernon under the terms of a purchase and assumption agreement 
as a result of this transaction  the banking charter of the bank of mt 
vernon was relinquished and premier agreed not to compete in the markets previously served by the bank of mt 
vernon 
also  on december   the company disposed of certain assets and liabilities of the sabina bank 
the sale included all the loans approximately million and all the deposits approximately million  as well as the premises and equipment approximately million 
certain assets of the bank were retained by premier pending liquidation of the bank  which occurred in the operating results of both the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank were included in premier s operating results through the respective dates of the sale 
however  the operating results subsequent to do not include any of the operations of these two banks 
comparisons of average balances and income statement categories to are all affected by the disposition of these two subsidiaries 
balance sheet analysis summary a financial institution s primary sources of revenue are generated by its earning assets  while its major expenses are produced by the funding of these assets with interest bearing liabilities 
effective management of these sources and uses of funds is essential in attaining a financial institution s optimal profitability while maintaining a minimum amount of interest rate risk and credit risk

in  average earning assets declined by or million from  following a or million decline in from average interest bearing liabilities  the primary source of funds supporting the earning assets  decreased or million from  which follows a or million decline in from the decline in average earning assets was the result of the residual effect of the million of loan charge offs in  the million of loan charge offs in primarily at farmers deposit in both years  coupled with loan maturities and principal pay downs that were not renewed and the redeployment of other available funds to reduce debt 
the decline in interest bearing liabilities was largely due to debt reduction strategies  a continued shift in customer deposits from interest bearing to non interest bearing  and the non renewal of certain certificates of deposit at farmers deposit bank in conjunction with premier s capital restoration plan for that bank 
other than the effects of the capital restoration plan  the same factors were the result of the decline in average earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities in compared to additional information on each of the components of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is contained in the following sections of this report 
loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during average loans declined by million or in the decline is largely attributable to the high level of charge offs and loan collections at farmers deposit 
the average loans outstanding at farmers deposit declined by million in  million more than premier s total decline of million 
of the remaining increase  premier realized a increase in loans in its west virginia markets and an increase in loans in its ohio markets 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in average loans in premier s other kentucky markets 
due to the low interest rate environment  many borrowers sought to refinance their loans to reduce their interest costs 
due to the lackluster economy and the resulting lower demand for loans during much of and  larger banks began competing more strongly by enticing borrowers with prime rate or below prime rate loans 
therefore  scheduled loan maturities were not necessarily renewed with premier 
in  average loans outstanding decreased by million or compared to again  the decline is partially attributed to the high level of charge offs  primarily at farmers deposit down million on average  but also to stiffer competition from larger banks competing in premier s markets and a general decline in economic growth 
of the total decline in  premier realized a increase in loans in its west virginia markets and a increase in loans in its ohio markets 
these were more than offset by a decline in loans in premier s other kentucky markets 
total loans at december  decreased by million or from the total at december  this decrease follows a million or decrease in from total loans at december  the decline in period end loans was the result of the million of loan charge offs recorded during the year  primarily at farmers deposit million 
the decline in period end loans was the result of the million of loan charge off recorded during the year  primarily at farmers deposit  and declines due to low loan demand resulting from the poor economy and heavy refinancing activity by borrowers to obtain lower interest rates 
the following table presents a five year comparison of loans by type 
with the exception of those categories included in the comparison  there are no loan concentrations which exceed of total loans 
additionally  premier s loan portfolio contains no loans to foreign borrowers nor does it have a material volume of highly leveraged transaction lending

residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also participates in the solicitation of loans for the secondary market and recognizes the referral fees in non interest income 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plan 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default 
in addition to the loans presented in the loan summary table  premier also offers certain off balance sheet products such as letters of credit  revolving credit agreements  and other loan commitments 
these products are offered under the same credit standards as the loan portfolio and are included in the risk based capital ratios used by the federal reserve to evaluate capital adequacy 
additional information on off balance sheet commitments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued non accrual loans  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms to enable a delinquent borrower to repay and accruing loans past due days or more  were million  or of total assets of continuing operations at year end the amount is down significantly from the million of non performing assets of total assets of continuing operations at year end and the million of non performing assets of total assets of continuing operations at year end the decrease in was due to charge offs of loans determined to be uncollectible  the sale of million of oreo property  and the collection or rehabilitation of previously delinquent loans 
the increase in was due to the loan underwriting issues uncovered at farmers deposit bank 
as management s efforts to collect these loans upon maturity continues  loans are only renewed using premier s strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
premier is committed to continuing to reduce its high level of non performing assets and implementing strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in loans days past due 
premier s efforts at its other affiliate banks in and are masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans whereby management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
premier had no commitments to provide additional funds on non accrual loans at december  for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations 
during premier recognized  of oreo writedowns compared to million in during  premier realized a  net profit on the disposition of oreo properties  net of writedowns 
although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than original contracted terms 
during  approximately  of interest was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  while approximately  would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier s risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are usually determined to be impaired 
a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the creditor will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial condition and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed assessing the present value of estimated future cashflows using the loan s existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in a given loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions included greater than anticipated recoveries  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or to total year end loans 
this ratio is a decrease from the prior year s but still higher than the at the end of the decrease in the allowance in was the result of charge offs of loans previously identified as impaired partially offset by million of recoveries and million of additional provisions for loan losses during the increase at year end was the result of the significant allowance attributed to the loans at farmers deposit bank 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above 
the following table provides a detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
the provision for loan losses in was million  down significantly from the million provision in and the million provision in the provision in was the result of newly identified impaired loans and increases in the volume of loans outstanding at the banks located in west virginia 
the high level of provision in was the result of the net charge offs and increase in impaired loans at farmers deposit 
the relatively high provision in was in response to management efforts to identify the level of probable incurred losses throughout premier s troubled institutions using the best practices of its higher performing institutions 
these efforts were circumvented or rendered ineffective by the disregard for controls by the former president of farmers deposit 
premier continually evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  and changes in the provision are based on the estimated probable incurred loss of the loan portfolio

this level of net charge offs compares to the million of net charge offs in  up million or more than double the million of net charge offs experienced in approximately million or of the net charge offs were at farmers deposit bank 
while all categories of loan charge offs were down in  consumer and real estate loan charge offs continued to be higher than commercial loan charge offs 
although management believes it has identified the significant remaining credit risk in the loan portfolio  additional charge offs may be recorded in the coming months due to the high level of non performing loans and the resolution of collection efforts on those loans

investment portfolio and other earning assets investment securities averaged million in  a million or increase from the million averaged in this increase follows a increase from the million averaged in the increase in average investments in was the result of weak loan demand and funds from loan paydowns and payoffs at farmers deposit bank 
these funds were not used to fund new loans but were instead invested in high quality debt and mortgage backed securities 
the increase in was the result of weak loan demand across the company and stiffer competition from large banks in premier s markets 
again  funds from loan payoffs and maturities were not used to fund new loans but were invested in high quality debt securities

based upon analyses of asset liability repricing  interest rate forecasts  and liquidity requirements  funds are periodically reinvested in high quality debt securities  which typically mature over a longer period of time 
at the time of purchase  management determines whether the securities will be classified as trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
at december   all of premier s investments were classified as available for sale and carried on the books at market value 
as shown in the following securities maturity and yield analysis table  the average maturity period of the securities available for sale at december  was years months  lengthened somewhat by the year month average final maturity of the mortgage backed securities portfolio 
the table uses a final maturity method to report the average maturity of mortgage backed securities  which excludes the effect of monthly payments and prepayments 
approximately of premier s investment securities are us government agency or treasury securities that have an average maturity of years months 
the average maturity of the investment portfolio is managed at a level to maintain a proper matching with interest rate risk guidelines

premier s average investment in federal funds sold and other short term investments decreased by in this follows a increase in averaging million in  federal funds sold and other short term investments decreased million from the million averaged in  and were lower than the million averaged during the decrease in average federal funds sold in was the result of investing more of premier s available funds into higher yielding investments and using a portion of the funds to reduce outstanding debt 
the increase in average federal funds sold in was the result of maintaining additional liquidity at farmers deposit bank and the desire to keep more liquid funds on hand to take advantage of any potential rising interest rates 
fluctuations in federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report 
funding sources in  premier once again decreased the rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to the decline in market interest rates 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in and the paid in the decrease is largely due to declines in rates paid on time deposits as higher rate certificates of deposits have either not renewed at maturity or were redeposited at lower rates in conjunction with the decline in market interest rates 
similarly  rates paid on now and money market transactional deposit accounts also declined 
due to alternative sources of investment and an ever increasing sophistication of customers in funds management techniques to maximize return on their money  competition for funds has become more intense 
premier s banks periodically offer special rate products to attract additional deposits 
premier s deposits  on average  decreased by or million in the decrease follows a or million decrease in from the average in in  million of the decline in deposits was at farmers deposit bank  partially due to premier s capital restoration plan as certain deposits were not renewed as part of the plan to reduce the size of the bank 
the remaining million decline in average deposits was largely due to the withdrawal of some public fund deposits which were reestablished as repurchase agreements 
average repurchase agreements at affiliate banks other than farmers deposit increased by million during offsetting the remaining decline in average deposits in in  non interest bearing deposits increased by or million on average when compared to in  non interest bearing deposits increased by or million on average when compared to since no interest is paid on these deposits  an increase in non interest bearing deposits helps to increase premier s net interest margin and its profitability 
non interest bearing deposits are more susceptible to withdrawal and therefore may provide challenges to maintaining adequate liquidity 
see the additional discussion on liquidity below 
in  interest bearing deposits decreased by or million on average when compared to the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits at farmers deposit bank 
the remaining decrease was the result of the non renewal of certain high rate time deposits in that had a carryover effect on and a decrease in average interest bearing transaction deposits 
in  interest bearing deposits decreased by or million on average when compared to the decrease was primarily the result of planned non renewals of high rate time deposits which more than offset increases in average interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits 
the following table provides information on the maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  maturity of time deposits  or more december  in thousands maturing months or less  maturing over months through months  maturing over months through months  maturing over months  total  other funding sources for premier include short and long term borrowings 
premier s short term borrowings primarily consist of federal funds purchased from other banks  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with commercial customers 
these short term borrowings fluctuate depending on near term funding needs and as part of premier s management of its asset liability mix 
in  short term borrowings averaged million  up million from the average in near the end of  farmers deposit bank reduced its short term borrowings to zero as part of premier s recapitalization plan 
this event had the effect of reducing premier s average short term borrowings in by approximately million 
this decline in short term borrowings was more than offset by the public fund repurchase agreements established at the affiliate banks in as discussed above 
in  short term borrowings averaged million  down  from the average in the decline in was largely the result of terminating the repurchase agreements at farmers deposit bank in an effort to reduce the size of the bank 
long term borrowings consist of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings by premier s banks  other borrowings by the parent holding company and debt issued in the form of subordinated debentures to an unconsolidated trust subsidiary 
fhlb advances  on average  declined by or million in  following a or million decrease in premier uses fixed rate fhlb advances from time to time to fund certain residential and commercial loans as well to maximize investment opportunities as part of its interest rate risk management 
in and  premier elected not to renew most of its maturing fhlb advances and prepaid a limited number of other fhlb advances in order to reduce its outstanding debt 
at december   fhlb advances totaled million and had repayment schedules from five to eight years 
other borrowings  on average  declined by or million in and or million in as the parent company began using available funds to aggressively pay down its outstanding debt in late at december   other borrowings totaled  with a scheduled maturity in premier fully repaid this borrowing in the first quarter of for more information on other borrowings  see note to the consolidated financial statements

conversions by premier s subsidiary banks to fiserv systems will begin on april  with a targeted completion by june  based upon statistical data provided to fiserv by premier for proposal purposes  the estimated payments to fiserv for these services will be approximately  in  and  per year beginning in actual results may vary depending upon the number and type of accounts actually converted and future customer activity 
premier s trust preferred securities represent beneficial interests in the assets of pfbi capital trust nasdaq nms pfbip 
the trust holds million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures subordinated debentures due in this total is down from the million outstanding at december  due to million of early redemptions during the fourth quarter of quarterly cash distributions on the preferred securities are made to the extent interest on the debentures is received by the trust 
as previously disclosed  pursuant to an agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on september   as superseded by an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland dated january   premier is required to request approval for the payment of distributions due on the trust preferred securities 
during the quarter ended june   premier was notified by the federal reserve bank of cleveland that due to the deterioration of core earnings of the company  among other issues  the frb would not allow the payment of the distribution due june  on premier s trust preferred securities 
in response  premier reached an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland whereby premier s chairman of the board  who is also its largest shareholder  agreed to loan the company the amount of the distribution   so that premier  with the federal reserve bank s approval  could make the distribution 
the loan is unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank 
a similar agreement was reached for the payment of the distribution due september  premier s president and chief executive officer  who is also a director  agreed to loan the company the amount of the september distribution   this loan is also unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan also cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of cleveland 
in december  the federal reserve bank of cleveland frb denied premier s request to make the fourth quarter distribution 
accordingly  premier exercised its right to defer the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities for an indefinite period which can be no longer than consecutive quarterly periods 
premier continued to defer the payment of interest throughout and in the first quarter of  premier sought and received approval from the frb to make the first quarter distribution and all nine previously deferred quarterly distributions 
during the deferral period  the deferred distributions also accrued interest at an annual rate of 
this interest  the deferred distributions  and the current quarterly distribution are all scheduled to be paid on march  to holders of record on march  although the frb approved the payment of the deferred and current distributions through march  premier is still bound by the written agreement and will be required to request the frb s approval to pay future distributions 
no assurance can be given that the frb will grant such approval 
as part of a debt reduction and profitability plan presented on january  to the federal reserve bank of cleveland federal reserve  premier requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem  of the then outstanding  trust preferred securities 
the goal of the redemption was to use a portion of premier s cash on hand to reduce its total interest cost and thus improve profitability 
the redemption reduced premier s interest cost by approximately  per year 
however  this benefit was partially offset due to the interest accrued in on the deferred quarterly distributions 
in  premier requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem million of trust preferred securities on october  and another million on december  these two redemptions will reduce premier s future interest cost by approximately  per year 
future early redemptions  if any  will also require federal reserve approval  pursuant to a previously disclosed written agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on january  asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model prepared by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 
another measure of a company s interest sensitivity is the measure of economic value at risk evr 
the evr of a company s balance sheet at a given point in time is the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows 
similar to net interest income  evr can be simulated assuming changes in market interest rates 
the resulting percentage change versus the stable rate evr is an indication of the longer term repricing risk imbedded in the balance sheet 
at december   a basis point increase in rates is estimated to decrease premier s evr by while a basis point decrease would increase premier s evr by 
the percentage changes in evr for the basis point decrease are outside premier s alco guidelines 
however  the with market interest rates already at relatively low levels  the likelihood of an additional basis point decrease is believed to be remote 
furthermore  the low interest rate environment in limits the change in the market value of liabilities in a declining rate simulation because rates paid on liabilities cannot fall below zero 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets

liquidity liquidity is the ability to satisfy demands for deposit withdrawals  lending commitments  and other corporate needs 
premier s liquidity is based on the stable nature of consumer core deposits held by the banking subsidiaries 
likewise  additional liquidity is available from holdings of investment securities and short term investments which can be readily converted into cash 
furthermore  premier s banks continue to have the ability to attract short term sources of funds such as federal funds and repurchase agreements 
premier generated million of cash from operations in  which compares to million in and million in these proceeds along with the proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities and the repayment of loans were used to purchase securities  satisfy deposit withdrawals  and reduce outstanding debt during those years 
net cash provided by liquidating investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in net cash used to satisfy deposit withdrawals and reduce debt totaled million in  million in and million in details on the sources and uses of cash can be found in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the parent company had nearly million in cash held with its subsidiary banks 
this balance along with cash dividends expected to be received from its subsidiaries is sufficient to cover the operating costs of the parent  service its existing other debt and to pay the deferred trust preferred distributions approved by the federal reserve in the first quarter of during  the parent company received million from the sale of its subsidiary  citizens bank and generated million from operations 
premier used a portion of these proceeds to complete the necessary capital injections into farmers deposit bank to maintain the bank s capital ratios required by the fdic in accordance with the order 
premier used a substantial portion of the proceeds to reduce its borrowed funds and redeem a portion of the trust preferred securities outstanding 
the remainder was held for future use 
additional information on parent company cash flows and financial statements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio increased to during  up from in but down slightly from the during the ratios for all three years are considered adequate for a company of premier s size 
the increase in was largely due to the decline in average total assets due to the sale of citizen s bank kentucky on july  the decrease in was largely the result of the losses sustained during the year resulting from the operations of farmers deposit bank the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s risk adjusted capital to assets ratio was compared to at december  both of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was compared to at december  both of these ratios are above the recommended to recommended by the federal reserve 
the increase in the ratios was the result of the increase in total capital and decline in total assets resulting from the sale of citizens bank  coupled with a decrease in disallowed deferred tax assets 
in accordance with federal reserve guidelines for all banks and bank holding companies  deferred tax assets are subtracted from premier s available total equity disallowed if they generally cannot be realized through available tax refunds in a next twelve month timeframe 
premier s capital ratios are the direct result of management s desire to maintain a strong capital position 
additional information on premier s capital ratios and the capital ratios of its larger banks may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary source of funds for dividends paid by premier to its shareholders is the dividends received from its subsidiary banks 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the regulatory agencies 
under these regulations  the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits  as defined  combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years  subject to regulatory capital requirements and additional restrictions more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  premier s banks could  without prior approval  declare and pay to premier dividends of approximately million plus any net profits retained through the date of declaration by ohio river bank  citizens deposit bank  boone county bank and first central bank

net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  down from the amount earned in which follows a decrease in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier s size 
the decrease in net interest income in is largely due to a decrease in the volume of loans outstanding coupled with a decline in loan interest income resulting from the high level of non accrual loans at farmers deposit 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  decreases in the volume of earning assets primarily loans in reduced premier s interest income by million 
this decrease was partially offset by the lower volume of interest bearing liabilities in resulting in a million decline in interest expense 
the net effect was to reduce net interest income by  for the year 
similarly  the lower interest rate environment in  coupled with the decline in interest income for loans placed on non accrual resulted in reduced interest income of million 
this decline was partially offset by reduced interest expense of million which resulted primarily from the lower interest rate environment and the resulting lower rate paid on deposits 
during the latter half of  interest rates began to rise  which resulted in increases in the interest paid on premier s long and short term borrowings 
the overall effect of declining volumes and declining rates was a decrease in net interest income of million in when compared to similarly  in  a reduction in premier s volume of earning assets reduced interest income by million which was only partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense due to a lower volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the net result was a  decrease in net interest income from volume activity 
likewise  in  the declining interest rate environment coupled with loan interest income reversals due to loans placed on non accrual reduced premier s interest income by million 
this decline was only partially offset by the decline in the rates paid on deposits in as a result of the lower interest rate environment  premier s interest expense declined by million in versus the overall effect of declining volumes and declining rates was a decrease in net interest income of million in when compared to rate volume analysis of changes in net interest income dollars in thousands on a taxable equivalent basis vs vs increase decrease due to change in increase decrease due to change in net net volume rate change volume rate change interest income loans       investment securities   federal funds sold deposits with banks total interest income       interest expense deposits now and money market   savings certificates of deposit     short term borrowings other borrowings fhlb borrowings debt total interest expense       net interest income    fully taxable equivalent using the rate of 
note changes to rate volume are allocated to both rate and volume on a proportional dollar basis 
as net interest income dollars declined in  premier s net interest margin also decreased 
in  the yield earned on investment securities declined basis points to while the yield on the loan portfolio declined basis points to 
the net result on all earning assets was to reduce the yield basis points to in  down from earned in and earned in similarly  in premier reduced the average rate paid on its deposits by basis points by not renewing high rate certificates of deposit and by keeping the rates paid on other deposit products competitive with national and local market rates 
as the interest rate began to increase late in  the rates paid on premier s variable rate borrowings also increased 
the rate paid on short term borrowings increased basis points to and the rate paid on other borrowings increased basis points on average to 
furthermore  due to the interest required to be accrued on the deferred trust preferred distributions  the effective rate on the outstanding principal balance of the debt increased by basis points to 
the rate increase is magnified by the decline in the average balance outstanding due to premier s early redemptions in and the net result on all interest bearing liabilities was to reduce the cost of funds basis points to in  down from in and in as a result premier s net interest spread decreased by only basis points and its net interest margin decreased by only basis points to in  down from in and in further discussion of interest income is included in the section of this report entitled balance sheet analysis 
non interest income and expense non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving profitability 
recognizing this importance  management continues to evaluate areas where non interest income can be enhanced 
as shown in the table of non interest income and expense below  total fees and other income increased by or  in the increase in is largely due to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts  substantially offset by declines in insurance commissions and other sources of non interest income 
in  total fees and other income increased by or  from the increase in is also largely due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to  in  an increase of or  this increase follows a or  increase in over the increases are the result of changes in the way premier charges customers for over drawing their checking accounts and a general increase in customers and activity 
these increases were partially offset by declining insurance commissions 
insurance commissions declined by or  in and or  in largely due to lower new loan generations resulting from lower loan demand and stiffer competition from larger banks 
other income decreased or  in from the high amount of other income reported in this is primarily the result of a lower volume of commissions from originating secondary market mortgage loans  lower data processing revenue from non affiliate banks  and a high level of collections of loans retained from the bank of mt 
vernon and sabina bank sales 
other income increased by or  in this is a result of increases in various other sources of income such as debit card fees  commissions from originating secondary market mortgage loans and collections of loans retained from the bank of mt

premier s net overhead ratio  or non interest expense less non interest income excluding securities transactions and other similar non operating transactions to average earning assets was  an increase from the realized in and the ratio realized in while the ratio increased by basis points  the actual dollars of net overhead expense increased by only or  the primary reason for the increase in the net overhead ratio is the decrease in average earning assets without a corresponding decrease in operating costs 
for the year  net overhead was million  up  from the million of net overhead 
the current year increase follows an  or decrease in from the million of net overhead in total non interest expense in increased by  or from as decreases in oreo losses  bad check losses and occupancy and equipment expenses were essentially offset by increased professional fees  taxes not on income and other operating expenses 
this year s increase compares to a  or decrease in versus the decrease in was generally the result of decreases in staff costs  oreo losses and expenses and taxes not on income which were only partially offset by increases in professional fees  bad check losses and other expenses 
staff costs increased by only  or in versus increases in salaries and wages were essentially offset by reductions in medical insurance and other benefit costs 
in  staff costs decreased by  or compared to likewise  increases in salaries and wages were more than offset by reductions in medical insurance and other benefit costs 
in the second quarter of  employees were required to contribute a percentage of the overall medical insurance premium as premier changed its benefit structure to be more in line with its competitors 
the percentage of employee contribution was phased in over the two year period 
occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by  or in as lower equipment depreciation and maintenance costs were complemented by lower occupancy costs 
in  occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by  or as decreases in equipment expenses were substantially offset by an increase in occupancy costs 
professional fees increased by  or in versus primarily due to increased audit costs as well as legal fees and other professional fees associated with premier s investigation of farmers deposit bank and the related sec investigation as disclosed in previous filings 
professional fees increased by  or in versus the increase in was largely due to legal and audit costs related to the farmers deposit bank investigation 
taxes not on income increased by  or in versus the increase in is due to an increase in franchise taxes imposed by the states in which the banks operate 
taxes not on income decreased by  or in versus largely due to employment of tax saving strategies resulting from the moving of the company headquarters to west virginia 
oreo writedowns and expenses netted to a  benefit in as premier realized  of net profit from the disposition of oreo properties in a majority of the gains on the disposition of oreo were on properties from which no previous writedowns had occurred 
this profit more than offset the costs of maintaining the remaining oreo property held in the net benefit in is a  decrease from the  of oreo writedowns and expenses recorded in the decrease from follows a  or decrease from the million of these expenses in the high level in was largely due to writedowns of oreo property to net realizable values as management emphasized efforts to liquidate the properties 
bad check losses totaled  in  a  decrease from the  recorded in the losses were a  increase from the  of bad check losses recorded in the increase in was primarily the result of bad checks losses at farmers deposit bank related to dishonored checks discovered during investigation 
the collection of these checks is still being pursued by the bank 
accelerated trust preferred issuance costs were recognized in and at the time of issuance  the costs to originate the trust preferred securities were capitalized 
the costs are being amortized over the year life of the securities which mature in and are recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
in march  premier redeemed million of the trust preferred securities in accordance with the terms of the instrument 
at that time an amount of the remaining unamortized issuance costs proportional to the million of the then million of trust preferred securities outstanding was expensed to non interest expense 
this amount totaled  in likewise  as a result of the million early redemption on october  and the additional million redeemed on december   premier expensed  of the issuance costs 
additional information on the trust preferred securities is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other expenses totaled million in  a or  increase from the million recorded in the increase in is largely due to a  writedown of the former headquarters of premier located in georgetown kentucky prior to its sale 
other operating expenses in were approximately the same amount recorded in an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses is included in the loan portfolio section of the balance sheet analysis of this report 
applicable income taxes premier recognized  of income tax expense related to continuing operations 
this amount compares to the million income tax benefit recognized in and the million income tax benefit recognized in the benefit in and was due to the pretax losses realized by premier 
premier s effective tax rate was in  down from the negative in and the negative in premier s effective tax rates in and were increased by the benefits of holding tax exempt investments and other tax saving instruments 
these tax saving benefits helped to reduce premier s positive tax rate in to from the statutory rate 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report 
summary results of operations fourth quarter income from continuing operations for the three months ended december  totaled  a million improvement from the  loss from continuing operations reported for the fourth quarter of on a per share basis  premier s income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of was cents per share  compared to a loss of cents per share for the same quarter last year 
net interest income totaled  for the fourth quarter of  an increase of  or from the net interest income earned in the same quarter of the increase is the result of lower interest expense on deposits and borrowings  primarily due to lower outstanding balances of both 
the provision for loan losses was  in the fourth quarter of  a decrease of million or when compared to the fourth quarter of the large provision in was primarily the result of additional credit risk identified in the loan portfolio as a result of the on going investigation at farmers deposit bank 
non interest income excluding securities transactions totaled  in the fourth quarter of  a decrease of  or from the  in the fourth quarter of the decrease was largely due to decreased insurance commissions  secondary market fees and other income 
non interest expense totaled  in the fourth quarter of  a  or decrease from the  reported for the fourth quarter of increases in staff costs  professional fees and accelerated amortization of trust preferred issuance costs were more than offset by lower oreo expenses and writedowns  bad check losses  and collection expense

as discussed in the stock compensation expense disclosure above  the cost of stock options is measured at the fair value of the options when granted 
this cost will be required to be expensed over the employee service period  which is normally the vesting period of the options 
this standard will apply to stock option awards granted or modified after the first quarter or year following june  compensation cost will also be recorded for options already granted that have a vesting period beyond the date of adoption 
the effect on results of operations will depend on the level of future option grants and the calculation of the fair value of the options granted 
the effect of existing options that will continue to vest after the adoption date is anticipated to be immaterial 
there will also be no significant effect on the financial position of the company as total equity will not change as a result of the required recording of compensation cost
