determination of allowance for loan losses the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans  as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining portfolio 
reference should be made to note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein as item and to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following schedule sets forth the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and this allocation is based upon the consistent  quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any category 
in thousands loan balance allowance for loan losses loan balance allowance for loan losses allocated component impaired loans graded loans homogeneous pools other loans unallocated component the allowance allocated to impaired loans for the years and was based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
graded loans are those loans that exhibit some form of weakness 
allocations to this group are based upon the historical loan loss experience of the grades assigned and upon specific allocations to specific loans 
an allowance is allocated to the various pools of loans considered to be homogenous based upon the historical loan losses of each pool 
other loans consist of those loans not graded or impaired or considered homogenous 
these loans are grouped by risk assignments  which are based upon consideration of collateral values  borrower financial condition and performance  debt service capacity  cash flows  market share  and other indicators 
allocations of the allowance to these loans are based upon historical loan loss experience of the risk assignment

loans and risk descriptions real estate loans the banks originate loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled million or approximately of the loan portfolio 
the banks originate commercial real estate loans of up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the company s policy to originate these loans only to carefully selected borrowers and on properties in the market area 
of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
although many banks have had significant losses in commercial real estate lending  nbc and enb  historically  have sustained few losses  and those losses were not significant relative to the size of the entire commercial real estate loan portfolio at the time 
the banks originate loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in their lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
in the past  very few losses from these types of loans have been experienced 
loans for multi family or more residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income generating properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans nbc and enb offer consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million or of total loans at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers and because the terms and normally higher interest rates on such loans help maintain a profitable spread between the average loan yield and the cost of funds 
in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the unit  which secured the loan 
nbc and enb intend to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
the banks make commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms  which generally do not exceed five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed 
at december   commercial business loans represented approximately of the company s total loan portfolio 
d 
in the year  nbc experienced an unusual and unexpected loan loss of million  which is included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table iva a claim related to the loan loss has been filed with nbc s insurance carrier  however  no settlement has been reached at this time

introduction and management overview nbc capital corporation the corporation is a financial holding company that owns national bank of commerce nbc  which operates in eastern mississippi and tuscaloosa  alabama  and enterprise national bank enb  which operates in memphis  tennessee 
the corporation provides full financial services  including banking  trust services  mortgage services  insurance and investment products in its mississippi and alabama market areas and banking  mortgage services and investment products in its tennessee market area 
the corporation s stock is listed on the american stock exchange amex under the ticker symbol of nby 
effective following the close of business on march   nbc merged with enterprise bancshares  inc  enterprise the parent company of enb 
see significant events section of this management discussion and analysis and note b in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details relating to this acquisition 
during  there were two major external factors that significantly impacted the operating results of the corporation 
first  even though the federal reserve raised short term interest rates during the third and fourth quarters  rates remained at very low levels  and second  the overall economy in the company s mississippi market remained soft  resulting in low loan demand 
other events having had a material impact on the financial results for were the corporation s acquisition of enterprise and the closing of four under performing branches in the corporation s mississippi market 
to fund the acquisition of enterprise  the corporation used a combination of the proceeds of the issuance of million of trust preferred securities and million that was borrowed from the federal home loan bank fhlb by nbc and with approval from the comptroller of the currency  was then paid to the corporation as a special dividend 
the trust preferred securities were issued on december   and the borrowing from the fhlb was completed in late march of also  enterprise had outstanding million in trust preferred securities that were assumed by the corporation at the closing of the transaction 
as a result  during  the corporation incurred interest expense of approximately million approximately million  or 
per share  net of taxes related to its purchase of enterprise 
enb s operations for the three quarters ended december  are included in the corporation s operations for the year ended december  during this nine month period  enb contributed approximately  or 
per share  to the consolidated net income of the corporation  which partially offset the borrowing cost incurred to fund the acquisition 
in effect  the total transaction was dilutive to earnings per share by approximately 
per share in there were several factors that impacted the level of this contribution 
these factors were as follows the quarter ended june  was a period of transition and very few cost savings or revenue enhancements were attained during that quarter  however  during the quarters ended september  and december   approximately  of savings  net of taxes  was attained in the area of salaries and employee benefits due to the consolidation of operations  net interest income was reduced during this nine month period by approximately  net of taxes  by the amortization of the premium recorded to write enb s securities portfolio and the fhlb borrowings to market  and non interest expense was increased by the amortization of the core deposit intangible of  and by approximately  of one time charges recorded as a result of the acquisition both of these amounts are net of taxes 
finally  the corporation closed four under performing branches in its mississippi market during the second quarter and recorded a one time charge of  net of taxes 
as a result of these factors  the corporation s results for were below levels 

table of contents for  the corporation s net interest margin was  compared to for low interest rates during continued to cause reduced yields on loans  as the loan portfolio  which is composed of approximately variable rate loans and approximately fixed rate loans  continued to reprice downward 
many of the corporation s variable rate loans have interest rate floors of 
until the prime rate exceeded the level in december  the rates on these variable rate loans did not change 
therefore  the corporation did not receive the full impact of the earlier rate increases on its variable rate loan portfolio 
the low rate environment also lowered the corporation s return on its investment portfolio  as faster pay downs on the mortgage backed securities caused the premiums on these bonds to amortize at an accelerated rate and resulted in reduced yields 
also  the yields on the securities that rolled out of the portfolio in were approximately  while the current reinvestment yields range from to 
even though the corporation s overall cost of funds has continued to decline during the year  rates paid on interest bearing funds could not be reduced to a level that would offset the decline in asset yields 
unfortunately  the low interest rate climate did not substantially stimulate loan demand in many of the corporation s mississippi markets during even though overall loan demand remained low during most of  the corporation did not compromise its underwriting standards 
during the third and fourth quarters  some classified credits in one of our primary mississippi markets were written off and charged against the allowance for loan losses 
these credits had been previously identified and had adequate reserves recorded to absorb the charge offs 
as a result  we believe that overall credit quality of the loan portfolio was good at the end of the year 
during  the corporation continued its efforts to build non interest income 
this source of income  exclusive of gains on securities  increased from million in to million in  a increase 
this overall growth was achieved  even though the mortgage loan activity declined significantly in and resulted in mortgage loan fee income declining by approximately 
growth of non interest revenue has been and continues to be a major strategic goal for the corporation 
for  non interest income accounted for of revenues 
another goal of management in was to continue to control the level of non interest expenses 
during  total non interest expenses increased by million  or 
approximately million of the increase came from the non interest expenses of enb  approximately  for the cost to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and  from a one time charge for the branch closings in mississippi 
during  the corporation recognized million in securities gains  compared to only  in this  along with all of the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs  resulted in the corporation reporting net income of million  or per share for  compared to million  or per share for the corporation plans to improve its net interest income in first  the acquisition of enb provides the corporation access to a market with stronger loan demand than exists in its mississippi market 
enb serves the memphis msa  which is the th largest in the country and includes five counties and sixteen municipalities  with a population in excess of million 
the memphis msa adjoins desoto county  mississippi  the fastest growing county in mississippi 
the corporation increased its lending ability in that market with the addition of several experienced lending officers during the later part of  and it plans to add others in early the corporation believes the acquisition in memphis and the additional lending staff  along with the growth in its tuscaloosa market  will compensate for the continued slow loan growth in its mississippi markets 
it should be noted that projected loan growth in the memphis market is likely to be slowed during the first half of  as the company replaces two real estate development lenders who left the company in early march 
it is uncertain at this time how much these departures will affect the company s loan volume  however  it is managements intention to quickly fill these positions 
second  the corporation has centralized the underwriting of consumer credit 
the corporation s consumer loan portfolio has declined for several years as competition has increased for these customers 
also  the low and zero rate loans offered by the auto industry have had a major impact on auto financing  traditionally an important source of consumer loans for the corporation 
management believes that centralizing its consumer credit underwriting function will make the corporation more responsive to its customers needs and improve underwriting 
third  the corporation has begun using a new pricing model to price total commercial customer relationships rather than separately pricing each loan 
finally  the corporation will continue its efforts to grow by expanding into additional high growth markets  either through de novo expansion or through the acquisition of established banks 

table of contents in addition to these plans  the corporation will continue to look for ways to grow non interest revenues 
the entry into the memphis market should assist in this effort 
also  the corporation has opened a mortgage loan production office in the north jackson  mississippi market to take advantage of the strong growth associated with the opening of the nissan auto plant 
the corporation will also continue its efforts to control non interest expenses in and will look for ways to improve its efficiency ratio 
currently  management expects  based on available information  that interest rates will trend up during  and the overall economy in its mississippi markets will remain relatively flat to slightly up throughout the year 
strong growth is expected to continue in both the memphis and tuscaloosa markets 
the corporation s projections  budgets and goals are based on these expectations and the plan to move into additional high growth markets 
if trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  or expansion plans change  they could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of the corporation s operations most directly impacted would be the net interest margin  loan and deposit growth  provision for loan losses and non interest expenses 
another risk is that interest rates continue at current low levels for an extended period of time or trend downward 
if this happens  as existing loans in the portfolio mature  they will be paying off at older  higher interest rates 
the new loans that will be replacing them will be made at much lower interest rates 
rates on deposits are at a level that would make it very difficult to offset this loss in yield with a reduced cost of deposits 
this situation  if it occurs  will put additional pressure on the corporation s net interest margin and net income 
significant events following the close of business on march   the corporation acquired enterprise the holding company for enb 
enb operates three offices in memphis and germantown  tennessee 
this acquisition was an important part of the corporation s long term strategic plan as it allowed the corporation to expand its business into the rapidly growing east memphis  germantown and collierville  tennessee and desoto county  mississippi markets 
much time and effort was expended during the second and third quarters of to integrate enb into the corporation 
eliminating the back office operations of enb and allowing that work to be performed by nbc achieved various cost savings 
additionally  a great deal of effort was spent in building up the lending and customer service areas of enb 
as a result of these efforts  enb should be accretive to the corporation in see note b included in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details concerning this acquisition 
accounting issues note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the corporation s accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in the corporation s annual report  including management s letter to shareholders and this management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
it is management s opinion that the areas of the financial statements that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and therefore contain the most critical accounting estimates  are the provision for loan losses and the resulting allowance for loan losses 
the corporation s provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet 
the allowance is maintained at a level deemed adequate by the board of directors after its evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the corporation s loan portfolio 
the senior credit officers and the loan review staff perform the methodology used to make this determination on a quarterly basis 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of the corporation s ability to collect the loan and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value 
if it is determined that impairments exist  specific portions of the allowance are allocated to these individual loans 
all other loans are grouped into homogeneous 
table of contents pools  and risk exposure is determined by considering the following list of factors this list is not all inclusive and the factors reviewed may change as circumstances change historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
management makes its estimates of the credit risk in the portfolio and the amount of provision needed to keep the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level using what management believes are the best and most current sources of information available at the time of the estimates  however  many of these factors can change quickly and with no advance warning 
if management significantly misses its estimates in any period  it can have a material impact on the results of operations for that respective period and for subsequent periods 
another area that requires subjective and complex judgments is the liability and expense relating to the corporation s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the assumptions used in the determination of pension liability  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation  are evaluated by management  reviewed with the plan actuaries and updated as appropriate 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the discount rate and the expected rate of return on the plan assets have a significant impact on the actuarially computed present value of future benefits that is recorded on the financial statements as a liability and the corresponding pension expense 
in selecting the expected rate of return  management  in consultation with the plan trustees  has selected a rate based on assumptions compared to recent returns and economic forecast 
considerations were given to the current allocation of the portfolio and the probable rates of return of each investment type 
in selecting the discount rate  management  in consultation with actuarial consultants  selected rates that are based on rates of return on long term  high quality bonds having maturity dates corresponding as closely as possible to the expected retirement dates of the employees and the subsequent payout periods of the respective plans 
to reflect the appropriate discount rate on the corresponding bonds  management has reduced the discount rate from in to in and to in also  the expected rate of return has been reduced from in and to in detailed information on the corporation s pension plan and the related impacts of these changes on the liability and expense recorded in the corporation s financial statements can be found in note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  the corporation s wholly owned subsidiaries  nbc and enb  make loans to related parties  including directors and executive officers of the corporation and their relatives and affiliates 
these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  they are consistent with sound banking practices and within applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
see note o in the notes to consolidated financial statement and the corporation s proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  loans to executive officers are generally prohibited 
however  the rule does not apply to any loan made or maintained by an insured depository institution  if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the federal reserve act 
all loans to executive officers made by the corporation s bank subsidiaries are subject to the above referenced section of the federal reserve act 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a listing of all the corporation s affiliated companies 
in december  the corporation formed nbc capital corporation ms statutory trust i  under the laws of the state of connecticut for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities to partially fund the acquisition of enterprise 
also  as part of the enterprise acquisition  the corporation became the parent organization for enterprise tn statutory trust i  also organized under the laws of the state of connecticut for the purposes of issuing trust preferred securities for enterprise 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december the trusts  which are considered variable interest entities  are not consolidated into the financial statements of the corporation 
the only activity of the variable interest entities is the issuance of the trust preferred securities 
effective january   the corporation adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill  however  it does require periodic testing for impairment 
the corporation completed its impairment test in accordance with statement no 
in october and concluded that no impairment write down was warranted 
at december   the corporation had approximately million of goodwill on its balance sheet  which will remain at that level unless it becomes impaired under the definition of impairment in statement no

nii increased by in after declining by in changes in nii may be divided into two components  first  the change in average earning assets volume component and second  the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  nii increased by million  or  from million in to million 
for the last nine months of  enb contributed approximately million to the total 
during  net interest margin continued to decline from to 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by average earning assets 
as yields on earning assets continued to decline during the year  the extended period of low rates made it impossible to reduce the cost of funds in an amount sufficient to offset the loss of yield 
even though rates began to increase during the second half of  the corporation did not get the full impact of the increase in its loan portfolio because many of its variable rate loans had floor rates 
only with the final increase of did the prime rate exceed the level 
approximately of the loan portfolio is made up of variable rate loans  therefore  the corporation should see a much larger impact on interest on loans from future rate increases 
as can be seen in the following table  yields on earning assets declined by basis points in  from to 
this loss was partially offset by a decline of basis points in the cost of funds  from in to 
during  average earning assets increased million  however  million of this increase resulted from the enb acquisition 
due to the slow economy in its core mississippi market area  the corporation  exclusive of enb  grew earning assets by million  or  during all of this growth came from the loan portfolio 
in  nii decreased by  from million to million  as the net interest margin declined from in to in in  yields on earning assets declined by basis points from to 
this loss was partially offset by a decline of basis points in the cost of funds  from to 
also  due to the slow economy and low loan demand in its market area  the corporation only grew earning assets by million  or  during all of the growth came from the investment portfolio and federal funds sold 
as rates continue moving upward during  it will be very important to control the increase in the cost of funds 
if these costs are not controlled  the net interest margin will remain under pressure as the rates continue their upward movement

the allowance is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management and the board of directors after their evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the loan portfolio 
this is an ongoing process and the amount of the provision is reviewed and determined monthly  using a standard methodology that over the years has proven to be sound 
the provision for loan losses decreased slightly from  in to  in  and increased in to  of the  increase in   came from the provision for enb 
even though the economy in the corporation s core mississippi market improved somewhat in  loan demand showed only slight improvement  and the forecast is for the gradual recovery to continue 
considering these factors  management intends to increase the provision for loan losses in to million 
at this time  management expects the level of the provision to protect the corporation from any unforeseen deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
however  if at any time during the year  any or all of these factors change in direction or speed  the corporation will make the necessary adjustments in the provision to reflect these changes 
non interest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions collected by the corporation  including insurance commissions earned by galloway chandler mckinney insurance agency  inc  a 
table of contents wholly owned subsidiary of nbc 
it has been  and continues to be  a strategic focus for the corporation to diversify its other income sources so that it can be less dependent on net interest income 
the corporation has been successful in its efforts 
other income increased from million in to million in in  there was a small decline to million 
this represents an increase over the two year period 
the changes in the major categories are as follows enb service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income mortgage loan fees security gains losses  net bank owned life insurance income other total exclusive of enb  non interest income for declined million  or 
as reflected in the preceding table  the largest declines came in the categories of mortgage loan fee income and securities gains 
the decline in security gains will be discussed later in this document 
mortgage loan fee income  exclusive of enb  declined by million  or 
this decline resulted from a significant reduction in mortgage loan refinancing 
at december   the mortgage loan pipeline was million  compared to million at december  this may indicate that we will see increased activity going into the first quarter of all of the comparison and discussion concerning the other accounts in this paragraph will be exclusive of enb 
service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased account activity  more uniform application of account based fees and selected fee increases 
insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased by  or 
this increase resulted from a slight increase in sales volume 
other service charges and fees increased by  or 
the majority of this increase came from a  or increase in fees associated with credit  debit and atm cards 
this resulted from increased usage as the retail customer base grew during the year with the introduction and marketing of free checking accounts 
the other large increase in this category came from retail investment sales  which increased in by  or  driven mainly by increased sales volume 
trust department income increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from higher fees related to the impact of the improvement in the equity markets on the value of the assets under management and a increase in the number of accounts under management 
bank owned life insurance income declined by  or  during the year  as the insurance companies continued to lower their crediting rates as the yields on their general account portfolios continued to decline as older  higher yield assets matured and were replaced by securities with lower yields 
the decline in the other account was composed of changes in several accounts  none of which were considered material 
during  the increase in non interest income was million  or 
as can be seen in the table  every category increased  except for bank owned life insurance income and the other category 
service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased account activity  more uniform application of account based fees and selected fee increases 
insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased by  or 
this increase resulted from a combination of increased business activity and overall higher premiums in the insurance industry 
other service charges and fees increased by  or 
the majority of the increase in this category came from a  or  increase in retail investment income 
the mortgage loan fee income increased  or 
this came from a record demand for mortgage loans in the low rate environment of even though the demand for new home loans was strong  the majority of the demand came from the refinancing of existing loans 
much of the demand to refinance loans came from mortgage holders moving from adjustable rate loans to fixed rate loans with rates at forty year lows 
during the month of september  the rate environment changed as the 
table of contents long end of the interest rate curve went up  causing mortgage rates to increase 
this caused a dramatic decline in activity 
the corporation s mortgage loan pipeline declined from its record level at june   of million  to million at december  the large increase in retail investment income can be attributed to the overall improvement in the equity markets in and the resulting higher level of activity 
trust department income increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from higher management fees related to the impact of the improvement in the equity markets on the values of assets under management 
bank owned life insurance income declined  or 
this decline resulted from the lower interest rates paid by the major carriers 
all bank owned life insurance policies are general account policies and the rates have declined as older  higher yielding investments have matured and been replaced with securities with lower yields 
the other category did not change by a material amount 
the corporation recognized  in securities gains during  compared to  in and  for the gains came primarily from selling certain securities that were pre refunded and were within one year of maturity and from some securities being called at a level above their recorded book value 
approximately of the gain and of the gain was recognized in the period from july  to june  with a large portion of available for sale securities portfolio composed of mortgage backed securities  the corporation took advantage of a unique interest rate environment that developed during that period 
that rate environment allowed certain securities to be sold at a gain and replaced with similar securities with yields at or above the level of the securities sold 
this opportunity resulted from the rapid prepayment of some mortgage backed securities  which reduced their yields and average lives and made them attractive at premium prices to short term investors 
the corporation took advantage of this opportunity to improve portfolio yields without extending maturities beyond acceptable levels  and at the same time recognizing gains 
non interest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses  including salaries  bonuses and benefits 
the corporation maintains a formal salary administration program that considers extensive comparative salary data and other indices supplied by a leading outside consulting firm 
this data is utilized to assure that salaries are competitive with comparable jobs in the marketplace 
incentive bonuses were expensed in and paid to employees based on the attainment of predetermined profit goals 
the predetermined profit goals were not reached in and  therefore  no significant bonuses were accrued in either of these years 
overall  the corporation has been successful in its efforts to limit the growth in non interest expenses  as these expenses increased from million in to million in and million in  exclusive of enb 
this represents only a increase over the two year period 
as shown in the following table  non interest expense associated with enb for the last nine months of was million  which included approximately million of amortization of the core deposit premium recorded at acquisition 
enb salaries employees benefits net occupancy expense furniture and equipment expense other total all the changes in non interest expense categories will be discussed exclusive of the expenses incurred by enb during the last nine months of total non interest expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in salaries increased in by  or 
as previously stated  no bonuses were paid in either or the overall percentage of salary increase for the year was approximately 
this was partially offset by an overall reduction in the number of employees 
during  employee benefits increased by  or 
approximately of this increase came from an increase in pension expense 
even though improvement in the equity markets enhanced the returns earned on the plan assets during  the impact of low interest rates on the present value calculation caused the total expense of the plan  as computed by the actuary  to increase 
also  as disclosed in note m in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the discount rate used by the actuary was for both and and the expected rate of return was reduced from in to for net occupancy expense remained 
table of contents relatively unchanged during furniture and equipment expense increased by  or 
the majority of this increase came from the category of maintenance contracts on both new and upgraded computer software packages placed in production during this was the first full year of use for the central collections  central underwriting and loan pricing packages installed in also during  the corporation upgraded its deposit imaging system originally installed in the other expense category increased by  or 
the major accounts included in the category are communications  data processing  advertising  professional fees  intangible amortization and other expenses 
three accounts from this group had material changes in first  professional fees increased by approximately  or 
this increase resulted from the cost incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of second  the corporation incurred approximately  of expenses related to the closing of four under performing branches in its mississippi market 
finally  insurance expense increased by approximately  or 
during  the corporation was insured under a three year policy purchased in this policy was renewed in under a one year contract at a substantially higher premium 
the other accounts included in this category did not have material changes during during  the increase in non interest expenses was limited to only  or 
salaries declined in by  or 
as stated earlier  no bonuses were accrued during the year 
also  through attrition  the corporation was able to reduce the overall number of employees 
this savings was somewhat offset by normal salary increases during the year 
employee benefits increased by  or 
this entire increase resulted from higher pension cost 
even though the recovery in the equity markets greatly improved the returns earned on the plan assets during the year  the impact of low interest rates on the present value calculation caused the total expense of the plan  as computed by the actuary  to increase 
the combined change in net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense created a reduction of  the other expense category increased by  or 
this increase occurred primarily in the area of marketing  as the corporation began a new branding campaign during changes in the corporation s income tax expense have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
the corporation s effective tax rates were in  in and in these changes in both years resulted primarily from the mix of income from tax exempt investments and the percentage relationship of tax exempt income to total pre tax income 
the corporation s ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments is limited by the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and the corporation s normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements 
in summary  net income decreased from million  or per diluted share  in  to million  or per diluted share  in  and to million  or per diluted share  in approximately cents per diluted share of the decline in came from the enterprise acquisition and approximately cents came from the expenses incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and the closing of the four branches 
management expects the performance to improve in  as enb becomes accretive  the corporation is not required to duplicate the initial documentation requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  the overall economies in our alabama and tennessee markets remain strong and the economy in our mississippi market improves

at december   the corporation was holding the cash in an interest bearing bank account pending the closing of the enterprise transaction on april  the investment securities portfolio increased during from million to million 
this represented an increase of million  or 
the addition of enb accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million represents management s efforts to keep all excess cash invested in earning assets 
the loan portfolio increased during by million  or  from million to million 
at december   enb accounted for million of 
table of contents this increase 
in addition to the loans carried on enb s books at the end of the year  it had generated and participated an additional million in loans to nbc 
the remainder of the corporation s markets grew their loan portfolio by approximately million 
the lack of growth in the overall economy in the corporation s mississippi market has caused loan demand to remain soft 
the alabama market showed good loan demand during  resulting in a growth 
two areas of our loan portfolio continued to decline in in the area of consumer loans  the softness in the economy  growing non bank competition and the continuation of zero rate loans on new autos resulted in an overall decline in the consumer loan portfolio of approximately  exclusive of enb 
in the area of real estate loans the corporation s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio  exclusive of enb  declined by approximately million  or  as adjustable rate mortgages continued to payoff or refinance into fixed rate mortgages 
to offset the decline in the loan portfolio  at december  the corporation had purchased approximately million of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
during  approximately million  or  of the loans were paid off 
the general lack of loan demand resulting from the lack of growth in the core mississippi market was a primary reason for the corporation s decision to purchase enterprise 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased by million  or  from million to million 
approximately million of the total allowance is assigned to the enb portfolio 
even though there has been increased competition for good quality credits in its markets  the corporation did not reduce its underwriting standards  and as a result  the quality of the portfolio remains strong 
net charge offs for and were 
of average net loans outstanding for each year 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the transactions in the allowance for loan losses for the three year period ended december  at december   non performing loans totaled only

the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from at december  to of total loans at the end of based on the evaluations described earlier and the information above  the allowance for loan losses at the end of and were deemed adequate to cover exposure within the corporation s loan portfolio 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses was tested during the fourth quarter  as several loans in one of our mississippi markets were charged off 
all these loans had previously been identified and properly reserved for  and therefore  no additional reserve was required for these loans 
the liability side of the balance sheet increased from million at december  to billion at december   an increase of million  or 
enb accounted for million of this increase 
during  deposits increased by million  or  from million to billion 
enb accounted for million of the increase 
nbc generated the remaining increase of million 
approximately million came from brokered deposits 
the remaining million came from increases in all the deposit categories and from both the core and public sectors 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million  or from million to million 
the addition of enb accounted for million of this increase 
also during the year  fhlb advances increased by million  or 
at december   enb had million in outstanding fhlb borrowings 
during the year  nbc reduced its fhlb borrowings by approximately million 
the corporation s subordinated debentures increased million during these debentures had been issued by enterprise prior to the acquisition and were assumed by the corporation as part of the transaction 
these debentures were issued to a special purpose entity named enterprise tn statutory trust i for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
the terms of the trust preferred securities and the subordinated debentures are the same 
each has a thirty year maturity and is callable  in whole or in part  at any interest payment date after five years 
the interest rate floats based on day libor and adjusts on a quarterly basis 
interest is payable quarterly 
capital the corporation has historically been well capitalized in comparison to its peers 
at december   the capital to asset ratio was 
the peer organizations are traditionally in the to range 
it has been one of management s objectives to reduce the capital to assets ratio to a level closer to peers 
management accomplished this objective during with the all cash acquisition of enterprise 
as a result of this acquisition  the corporation added approximately million in assets with no additional capital  which reduced the capital to asset ratio at december  to 
table of contents shareholders equity increased from million at the end of to at the end of during  the corporation generated net income of million  from which it declared approximately million in dividends 
also during the year  the interest rate climate changed as long term rates increased  causing the market value of the available for sale securities to decrease 
as a result  accumulated other comprehensive income changed from an unrealized loss of  at december  to an unrealized loss of  at december  this million loss in value  along with the million in dividends  offset a substantial portion of the million added to equity by net income 
prior to the consummation of the acquisition  enterprise had outstanding options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the options holders were given the choice of converting these options into options to purchase shares of the corporation at the appropriate exchange ratio or selling the options for the difference between the per share deal price and the grant price of the options 
a large majority of the option holders took advantage of the cash offer and in effect  exercised and sold their options  generating a million tax deduction for enterprise 
since enterprise was merged into the corporation  the tax impact of this deduction of approximately  was reflected as an addition to surplus  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the remaining option holders converted their enterprise options into options to acquire approximately  shares of common stock of the corporation 
since the enterprise options were fully vested at the acquisition date  the corporation recorded the intrinsic value of the options  or  into surplus  also in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during  the value of treasury stock increased from  to  as the number of shares held increased from  to  this increase came from stock purchased through the stock repurchase program first announced in july of and extended in july of the initial plan approved the repurchase of up to  shares or up to of the corporation s outstanding common stock 
during   shares were purchased under this program for approximately  or an average of per share 
during the fourth quarter of  no shares were purchased under this program 
also during  the corporation issued  shares upon the exercise of stock options for approximately  at december   the corporation could purchase an additional  shares under its stock repurchase program 
during the year ended december   the corporation used ftn midwest securities corp 
to purchase these shares under the stock repurchase plan in the open market in accordance with securities and exchange commission rule b current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
at the end of  the corporation maintained an leverage ratio  significantly exceeding the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized financial institution is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes allowance for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes allowance for loan losses of

liquidity  asset liability management liquidity may be defined as the ability of the corporation to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
the corporation has not experienced any problems with liquidity during and anticipates that all liquidity requirements will be met in the future 
the corporation s traditional sources of funds from deposit growth  maturing loans and investments and earnings have generally allowed it to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its daily operational liquidity needs 
as the result of a million increase in loans and a million increase in deposits  the corporation s loan deposit ratio increased from in to in a large portion of the growth in both loans and deposits came from the acquisition of enb 
total funding sources for the corporation includes not only deposits  but also federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb borrowings 
when these sources of funding are included with deposits  the corporation s loans to total funding increased in from to 
management s target loans to total funding ratio is approximately 
the current level leaves the corporation with the ability to fund approximately million in additional loans and remain at the target loans to total funding ratio 

table of contents the corporation offers repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of its larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
repurchase agreements  which are viewed as a source of funds to the corporation  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts 
due to the limited amount of repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under the control of the corporation  the exposure for this service is not considered material 
on december   the corporation issued million in subordinated debt to partially fund the acquisition of enterprise 
the total cash expended in the acquisition was million 
the remaining portion of the purchase price came from a special dividend from the corporation s subsidiary bank  nbc  in the amount of million 
nbc obtained the cash by borrowing under its fhlb line of credit 
the following table shows the contractual obligations for the corporation as of december  in thousands total due in less than year due in years due in years due after years long term debt operating leases federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase other borrowings total contractual obligations the following table shows the other commercial commitments for the corporation as of december  in thousands total expires in less than year expires in years expires in years expires after years lines of credit unfunded commitments standby letters of credit the corporation believes that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional fhlb borrowings  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow it to meet these obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   the corporation had the ability to borrow approximately million from the fhlb and had other short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
the corporation has no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the fhlb borrowings 
the corporation does not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity other than its announced stock repurchase program 
at december   the corporation had the authority  at its discretion  to purchase  additional shares of its common stock 
if purchased at the year end closing price of  this purchase would require approximately million 
any purchases under this program will be made over an unknown period of time  and the necessary funds will be provided from normal sources 

table of contents under regulations controlling financial holding companies and national banks  the banks are limited in the amount they can lend to the corporation and such loans are required to be on a fully secured basis 
at december   there were no borrowings between the corporation and its subsidiary banks 
the corporation has maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during this policy focuses on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
during  the corporation did not engage in any non exchange traded contracts such as currency or interest rate swaps  nor did it purchase or hold any derivative securities 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
the corporation utilizes an asset liability management committee that evaluates and analyzes the corporation s pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  funding  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for its decision making 
modeling techniques are also utilized to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  the corporation s goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a neutral rate sensitive position 
at year end  the corporation s balance sheet reflected approximately million more in rate sensitive assets than liabilities that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of total assets and would indicate that the corporation is asset sensitive 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
it is the corporation s policy to maintain a static gap position of no more than a plus or minus of aggregate assets over a moving twenty four month period 
management believes that interest rates will increase during and that the corporation s current position places it in the correct interest rate risk posture for a rising rate environment 
management does not believe that it is in the corporation s best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  they could also be put at significant risk if interest rates move against predictions 
market information the corporation s stock is listed on the amex and is traded under the symbol nby 
suntrust bank  atlanta  acts as transfer agent for the corporation

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than collateralized mortgage obligations  which are commonly held securities generally collateralized by pools of gnma  fnma  or fhlmc pass through securities 
finally  the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
the following table reflects the year end position of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which can either  reprice or mature within the designated time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps can vary from day to day and are not necessarily a reflection of the future 
in addition  certain assets and liabilities within the same designated time period may nonetheless reprice at different times and at different levels 
in thousands december  interest sensitive within cumulative within months within months within years total of interest earning assets interest earning assets loans investment and mortgage backed securities federal funds sold and other totals interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowed funds sensitivity gap dollar amount percent of total interest earning assets the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same 
table of contents time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result whereas an institution with a negative gap could experience the opposite results 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were more than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a positive cumulative one year gap of of earning assets 
management believes this position to be acceptable in the current interest rate environment 
banking regulators have issued advisories concerning the management of interest rate risk irr 
the regulators consider that effective interest rate management is an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor its irr  the company s risk management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
the company does this by first preparing a base strategy which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or  most likely  interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by an asset liability management committee 
interest rate risk is managed based upon the company s tolerance for interest rate exposure and the resulting effect on net income and the market value of equity 
the company s modeling of net income assumes a plus or minus basis points change ramping in rates over the following months 
the december model reflects net income under this scenario increasing by over the next months with a basis point ramp up of rates and decreasing if rates ramp down basis points over the next months 
the company uses a rate shock model to test interest rate changes on market value of equity 
in this modeling process  rates are shocked instant change up or down basis points to determine the impact on equity 
at december   a basis point immediate increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decline in market value of equity  and a basis point instant decrease would have resulted in an decrease in market value of equity 
the company s guidelines allow for no more than a plus or minus change in net income and a plus or a minus change in market value of equity 
even though the income variance was outside of policy  it is unlikely that rates will drop basis points during to address this exception would necessitate changes in balance sheet structure that management believes to be inappropriate in a rising rate environment 
thus  at december   management believed that changes in income and market value of equity  as reflected in the company s models  were acceptable
