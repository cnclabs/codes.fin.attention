item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the operations of the company and its subsidiary  the bank  are generally influenced by overall economic conditions  the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of financial institution regulatory authorities  including the commissioner  the federal reserve board and the fdic 
the bank monitors its exposure to earnings fluctuations resulting from market interest rate changes 
historically  the bank s earnings have been vulnerable to changing interest rates due to differences in the terms to maturity or repricing of its assets and liabilities 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank s net interest income and net income could be negatively affected as interest sensitive liabilities deposits and borrowings could adjust more quickly to rising interest rates than the bank s interest sensitive assets loans and investments 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations for the last three fiscal years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal years and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  impairment of securities  and derivative loan commitments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the allowance for loan losses policy is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and management s estimation of inherent losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
refer to the discussion of allowance for loan losses in item business and notes and to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of management s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically reviews the bank s deferred tax asset and current income tax position using historical  current  and future pretax earnings 
adjustments to the deferred tax asset are recognized as deferred income tax expense or benefit based on management s judgments relating to the realizability of such asset 
there can be no assurance  however that the company will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings 
refer to income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning the company s tax position 
management believes that the measurement of impairment of securities requires an evaluation process that considers both the historical and current financial performance and environment of the security  credit worthiness of the issuer  and potential recovery measures of each impaired investment 
management periodically reviews all securities to identify those that show signs of impairment 
once identified these securities are monitored and 
table of contents evaluated based upon the above considerations and if the decline in fair value below the cost basis of an investment is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis is written down to the current fair value and the amount of the write down is included in the results of operations 
the company has derivatives consisting of forward commitments to sell loans in order to reduce market risk associated with commitments to fund loans held for sale 
an increase in market interest rates between the time the bank commits to terms on a loan and the time the loan is sold will generally have the effect of reducing the gain or increasing the loss recorded for the sale 
forward loan sale contracts and commitments to fund loans intended for sale are recorded at fair value 
management uses both a discounted cash flow analysis which is dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the level of interest rates and estimates based on outstanding investor commitments to calculate market value 
results of operations overview 
the company s results of operations during the past three fiscal years have been influenced by several significant factors 
from a recurring operating perspective  the generally declining trend in both short and long term interest rates from january until march has had a significant impact on both the balance sheet and income statement 
most notably  residential mortgage loans  which have historically been the company s largest asset  have declined million  or  from million at march  to million at march  with home mortgage rates declining and ultimately hitting a year low in  consumers have refinanced their mortgages  oftentimes on multiple occasions  to take advantage of the opportunity to lock in these low rates for up to years 
since the second half of fiscal  the company has sold the majority of its current originations of fixed rate residential mortgage loans in order to better manage its exposure to changing rates and  as a result  has experienced a shift in its asset mix from residential to commercial mortgage loans 
management has favored commercial real estate lending in recent years due to the shorter repricing characteristics of these loans generally every years  acceptable yields and the favorable economic market conditions in the company s lending area 
with the declining rate trend referred to above  the company experienced reductions in both its yield on interest earning assets and its cost of interest bearing liabilities since fiscal  as summarized in the following table yield cost spread fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal as this table indicates  the declining rate trend had a favorable impact on the company s net interest spread through fiscal this trend was also aided by the relatively high ratio of loans to interest earning assets maintained during this entire period  especially through fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  the favorable trend reversed as more assets were repriced downward mostly due to loan prepayments and modifications than were liabilities 
the unfavorable trend in the net interest margin in fiscal and fiscal is primarily reflective of the limitations the company had in reducing its overall cost of funds 
in spite of the increases in shorter term interest rates  the company attempts to hold the interest rates it pays on its deposits to the minimum amount it can pay in a competitive market 
during fiscal  the bank held off increasing the interest rates it paid on the core deposit account  but rather  introduced a promotional certificate for months that was successful in drawing in new funds to the bank 
during fiscal  the company s utilization of long term fhlb advances had limited repricing opportunity as only million in advances matured in fiscal long term fhlb advances can not be prepaid without a substantial penalty  which management elected not to pay 
second  the ability to reduce deposit rates in the current year was limited after the two prior years of rate reductions as well as competitive market factors 

table of contents the company financial results in fiscal were negatively impacted by costs incurred with the stock buyback  net of taxes  of approximately  the company s overall financial results in fiscal and were also affected by two significant non operating items  namely  state legislation affecting the taxation of its former reit subsidiary and shareholder and other litigation 
each of these items adversely affected overall financial results in fiscal and favorably affected financial results in fiscal in overall financial results were adversely affected by costs associated with the stock buyback discussed elsewhere 
the impact of these items is demonstrated in the following table in thousands net income per gaap reit legislation  net of taxes impact of shareholder litigation and legal fees  net of insurance and taxes costs associated with stock buyback  net of taxes non gaap pro forma earnings the company s earnings in fiscal were adversely affected by state legislation the reit legislation passed in march that retroactively eliminated the dividends received deduction on dividends received from the bank s former reit subsidiary 
the reit legislation resulted in an increase in the company s provision for income taxes of  in fiscal in june  a group of banks negotiated a settlement with the massachusetts department of revenue dor and  as a result  the bank recognized in fiscal a reduction in the company s provision for income taxes of the legal fees associated with the litigation with certain shareholders  who initially filed suit against the company in october following the annual meeting of shareholders and an accrual for a commercial claim  totaled approximately million  net of taxes  in fiscal the company had coverage under its directors and officers liability insurance policy for reimbursement of certain legal fees 
during fiscal  insurance recoveries in excess of related legal fees totaled  net of taxes 

table of contents interest rate spread 
the company s and the bank s operating results are significantly affected by its net interest spread  which is the difference between the yield on loans and investments and the interest cost of deposits and borrowings 
the interest spread is affected by economic conditions and market factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
the following table presents average balances  interest income and expense and yields earned or rates paid on all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated

table of contents rate volume analysis 
the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates and changes in the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is shown in the following table 
information is provided on changes for the fiscal years indicated attributable to changes in interest rates and changes in volume 
changes due to combined changes in interest rates and volume are allocated between changes in rate and changes in volume proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the company experienced an increase of  in net interest and dividend income for the year ended march  compared to fiscal the balance of average interest earning assets was virtually unchanged between years  however  the company shifted its asset mix towards shorter term investments in response to the decline in residential mortgage rates to forty five year lows 
with the decline in interest rates  management decided that most fixed rate residential mortgage loans would be sold in the secondary market rather than put into the loan portfolio 
during fiscal  million of such loans were sold 
this strategy  combined with continued loan prepayments as customers refinance their mortgages at favorable rates  lead to a reduction in the average balance of mortgage loans of million in fiscal this reduction occurred despite an increase in the commercial real estate portfolio of million during fiscal interest income on loans decreased by thousand to million due to the aforementioned decline in the average balance of loans and a basis point decline in the average rate earned 
interest income on investments increased by million in fiscal due to a basis point yield increase  combined with the aforementioned increase in average holdings 
the increase in yield on investments reflects the million increase in the average balance of investment securities which had a yield of in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased thousand from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is attributable to a million increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase was primarily attributed to money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit  which increased million and million respectively 
the increase in interest expense due to higher balances was partially offset by a decline in cost for interest bearing liabilities from for to for  a decline of basis points 
the average cost of fhlb advances decreased by basis points in fiscal this decline was attributable to the average outstanding balances of fhlb advances  which decreased by million 
an increase in the average balance of other borrowings of million was primarily due to the issuance of subordinated debentures by the company in september of fiscal year which contributed thousand to interest expense 

table of contents provision for loan losses 
during the year ended march   the company provided  for loan losses compared to a  provision for the year ended march  and no provision for the year ended march  while the company s loan quality  as measured principally by delinquency rates  charge offs and loan classifications  continues to be outstanding  the shifting of the mix of the loan portfolio to a greater portion of commercial real estate loans indicated the need for an increase in the allowance for loan losses in fiscal at march   the company had non performing loans totaling  and no non performing loans as of march  non interest income 
total non interest income increased  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to net gains on the sales and write downs of investments available for sale of  in fiscal as compared to a net loss of  in fiscal service fee income on deposits increased  during fiscal and totaled  net gains on the sales of loans totaled  in fiscal  for a decrease of  from  in fiscal the decrease in was primarily due to the reduction of the total volume of loans sold to investors and totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal other components of non interest income decreased during by  for brokerage income and  for other non interest income 
total non interest income declined  during fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decline was attributable to an overall reduction in gains on asset sales  net of impairment write downs  of  loan sale gains declined by  as a greater portion of loans were sold in fiscal on a mandatory delivery basis which results in a higher gain rate than the best efforts delivery basis used in in addition  loan sale gains in fiscal were adversely affected by the late delivery of certain loans to the investor  which caused the selling price of such loans to be reduced by  during fiscal  the company recognized additional impairment write downs of  in marketable equity securities which had experienced a decline in fair value judged to be other than temporary compared to  in such write downs in the prior year 
non interest expenses 
v 
non interest expenses increased million during fiscal  or  to million as compared to million for the year ended march  this increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expenses  professional fees  and other non interest expenses  partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses  and data processing service fees 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to average salary increases of  increases in staffing to support a larger asset base  as well as increases in health insurance  esop expenses  and unemployment insurance 
office occupancy and equipment expenses increased  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily increased insurance and maintenance and repairs expense along with increased depreciation of bank buildings and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements 
data processing servicing fees decreased by  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a renegotiation and extension of the contract with the bank s primary data processing provider 
professional fees increased  or approximately  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the increase in was primarily due to the costs incurred by the company that were associated with the stock buyback by the company and the esop plan during the current fiscal year  while the prior year amounts include the insurance recovery of expenses incurred with the shareholder litigation discussed herein 
marketing expenses decreased  or  to  in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
while the bank was able to undertake a significant deposit promotion during fiscal  there were fewer 
table of contents discretionary promotions compared to the prior year 
during fiscal  the bank initiated a major marketing initiative  including it s first ever use of radio advertisements  to promote the bank  in general  and its new free checking account 
in order for the bank to remain competitive in the market for deposit and loan customers  it anticipates that marketing expenditures will likely continue 
other non interest expenses increased by  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the modest increase in fiscal is primarily due to increases in insurance costs  primarily directors and officers liability insurance  recruiting expenses and increased contributions  partially offset by lower office supplies and reduced travel and seminar costs 
v 
non interest expenses decreased million during fiscal as compared to the year ended march  exclusive of the impact of the costs of litigation and related insurance recoveries for a commercial claim and shareholder litigation  both of which were settled in fiscal  non interest expenses would have increased  or 
this increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits  marketing expenses  and other non interest expenses  partially offset by a decrease in professional fees 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or  in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to average salary increases of  increases in staffing in the residential lending area  as well as increases in health insurance and pension expense 
these increase were substantially offset by a  reduction in incentive compensation 
professional fees decreased million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
exclusive of the legal fees associated with shareholder litigation incurred in both fiscal and  and an insurance recovery of million recognized in fiscal  professional fees would have decreased  in fiscal this decrease is largely due to the additional legal and other professional fees incurred in fiscal in connection with the contested election of directors at the company s september annual stockholders meeting 
marketing expenses increased  or  in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this significant increase resulted from additional promotion of residential and commercial loan products throughout the year as well as deposit promotions during the second half of the year 
the bank initiated a major marketing initiative  including its first ever use of radio advertisements  in march to promote the bank  in general  and its new free checking account 
the bank anticipates that competition for deposit customers will continue to increase as a result of the recent bank of america acquisition of fleet bank 
other financial institutions  including credit unions  have also been more active in their promotions in recent months  which will likely result in the continuation of marketing spending at higher rates than in the past though not at the level which occurred in fiscal other non interest expenses decreased  in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
exclusive of settlement costs associated with a commercial claim  such expenses would have increased  or  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increases in insurance costs  primarily directors and officers liability insurance  a record retention project  contributions and lending related costs 
income taxes 
the effective rates of income tax expense for the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
exclusive of the impact of an additional state tax provision necessitated by tax legislation and the related settlement of such taxes in fiscal  the company s effective tax rate would have been and in fiscal and  respectively 
the governor of massachusetts signed legislation on march   expressly disallowing deductions for dividends received from a reit  resulting in such dividends being subject to state taxation 
in addition  the legislation applied retroactively to tax years ending on or after december  in fiscal  the company provided additional income taxes of  as a result of this legislation 
given the significant financial impact of this issue on numerous massachusetts financial institutions and the considerable uncertainty of the constitutionality of the retroactive provisions of the legislation  a settlement was 
table of contents reached in june among the dor and the majority of affected financial institutions 
this settlement provided that of all dividends received by the bank from its reit subsidiary from through december were subject to state income taxes 
in addition  interest on the related taxes was also assessed 
in settlement of this matter  the bank paid  in june and also recognized a reduction in its tax provision of  which increased net income by the same amount in fiscal financial condition total assets at march  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from million at march  total assets at march  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from million at march  the growth in assets in was primarily caused by growth in the commercial real estate portfolio 
the modest growth in assets in fiscal was primarily caused by the deposit increase of million 
during fiscal  the increase in the deposits of million was used to repay fhlb advances  which contributed to the modest asset growth in fiscal net loans increased million  or  to million at march  primarily due to the growth in the commercial real estate portfolio 
the increase in fiscal is after realizing an increase of million in commercial mortgage loans during fiscal these increases reflect management s preference for these loans  which carry an adjustable interest rate that generally adjust every years based on the year fhlb classic advance rate 
as of march   commercial mortgages represent just over of the loan portfolio 
net loans decreased million to million at march  from million at march  while short term investments and investment securities increased million and million  respectively  during this same period 
this shift in asset mix reflects the impact of the reduction in longer term interest rates to a forty five year low in and the resulting decision by management to allow the residential loan portfolio  which consists primarily of to year fixed rate loans  to decline by million during fiscal total deposits increased million  or  to million at march  primarily due to a heavily marketed promotional certificate of deposit with a term of months 
total certificates of deposit represent approximately of total deposits at march  the bank realized increases of million in demand deposits  million in now accounts and  in regular savings accounts during fiscal total deposits at march  were million  a million increase from million in the prior year 
this increase includes core deposit growth of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of million 
advances from the fhlb of boston decreased to million at march  from million at march  the bank decreased its borrowings from the fhlb of boston in both fiscal and consistent with its intent of reducing the utilization of fhlb advances 
offsetting the reduction in the advances from the fhlb were increases in another form of borrowing  or subordinated debentures 
the company issued subordinated debentures during fiscal year and used the proceeds to pay for other funding needs 
stockholders equity decreased to million at march  from million at march  due primarily to a decrease of million in comprehensive income during fiscal and the purchase of  shares of common stock from shareholders of the company 

table of contents liquidity the company s primary sources of liquidity are dividends from its bank subsidiary 
in addition  the company has access to the capital markets to raise additional equity 
the bank s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  repayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  fhlb of boston advances and maturities of various other investments 
these various sources of liquidity  as well as the bank s ability to sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  are used to fund deposit withdrawals  loan originations and investment purchases 
deposits have been a relatively stable source of funds for the bank despite significant competition 
during fiscal however  the bank ran an aggressive marketing campaign for term certificates with a term of months causing the deposit balances to increase by million to million at march  from million at march  core deposits represented approximately two thirds of the bank s total deposits in fiscal but declined to less than as a result of the aforementioned promotion 
money market deposits had been the fastest growing component of core deposits but  as a result of the increase in the rates paid on all deposits by both the bank and its competitors as shorter term interest rates increased  there was a shift out of the money market accounts into higher rate certificates 
while the balances in the money market accounts had consistently increased in previous years  it is uncertain whether the impact of sustained higher interest rates will continue to draw balances from the core accounts into the certificates of deposit in future years 
the bank is a member of the fhlb of boston and has the ability to borrow from the fhlb of boston for any sound business purpose for which the bank has legal authority  subject to such regulations and limitations as may be prescribed 
at march  and  the bank had outstanding fhlb of boston advances of million and million  respectively 
the fhlb of boston advances are secured primarily by a blanket lien on residential first mortgage loans  us government and agency securities and all stock in the fhlb of boston 
at march   the bank had approximately million in unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb of boston 
the bank also may obtain funds from the federal reserve bank of boston  the co operative central bank reserve fund and through a retail cd brokerage agreement with a major brokerage firm 
the bank views these borrowing facilities as secondary sources of liquidity and has had no need to use them 
commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet risk the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk including commitments to extend credit under existing lines of credit and commitments to originate and sell loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to originate new loans or to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
loan commitments generally expire within to days 
most home equity line commitments are for a term of years  and commercial lines of credit are generally renewable on an annual basis 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
commitments to sell loans held for sale are agreements to sell loans on a best efforts delivery basis to a third party at an agreed upon price

unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
capital resources the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios pursuant to federal banking regulations 
the first standard establishes a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations 
two categories of capital are defined tier or core capital stockholders equity and tier or supplementary capital 
total capital is the sum of both tier and tier capital 
according to the standards  tier capital must represent at least of qualifying total capital 
at march   the minimum total risk based capital ratio required was 
the company s and the bank s risk based total capital ratios at march  were and  respectively 
to complement the risk based standards  the fdic adopted a leverage ratio adjusted stockholders equity divided by total average assets of for the most highly rated banks and to for all others

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the bank seeks to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rate  or market risk  through active monitoring and management of its interest rate risk exposure 
the policies and procedures for managing both on and off balance sheet activities are established by the bank s asset liability management committee alco 
the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors related activities on an ongoing basis 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  borrowing and deposit taking activities 
the main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and preserve capital  while adjusting the bank s asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the bank quantifies its interest rate risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model 
simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specific time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense under various rate scenarios 
the simulation is based on forecasted cash flows and assumptions of management about the future changes in interest rates and levels of activity loan originations  loan prepayments  deposit flows  etc 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  therefore  actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies 
the net interest income projection resulting from use of forecasted cash flows and management s assumptions is compared to net interest income projections based on immediate shifts of basis points upward and immediate downward shifts of basis points and basis points for fiscal year and  respectively 
internal guidelines on interest rate risk state that for every basis points immediate shift in interest rates  estimated net interest income over the next twelve months should decline by no more than 
the following table indicates the projected change in net interest income  and sets forth such change as a percentage of estimated net interest income  for the twelve month period following the date indicated assuming an immediate and parallel shift for all market rates with other rates adjusting to varying degrees in each scenario based on both historical and expected spread relationships at march  amount change amount change dollars in thousands basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates basis point decrease in rates
