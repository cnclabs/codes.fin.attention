overview we are a nationwide provider of equipment financing solutions primarily to small businesses 
we finance over categories of commercial equipment important to businesses including copiers  telephone systems  computers  and certain commercial and industrial equipment 
we access our end user customers through origination sources comprised of our existing network of independent equipment dealers and  to a lesser extent  through relationships with lease brokers and through direct solicitation of our end user customers 
our leases are fixed rate transactions with terms generally ranging from to months 
at december   our lease portfolio consisted of approximately  accounts  from approximately  customers  with an average original term of months  and average transaction size of approximately  since our founding in  we have grown to million in total assets at december  our assets are substantially comprised of our net investment in leases which totaled million at december  our lease portfolio grew in personnel costs represent our most significant overhead expense and we have added to our staffing levels to both support and grow our lease portfolio 
since inception  we have also added three regional sales offices to help us penetrate certain targeted markets  with our most recent office opening in chicago  illinois in the first quarter of growing the lease portfolio  while maintaining asset quality  remains the primary focus of management 
we expect our on going investment in our sales teams and regional offices to drive continued growth in our lease portfolio 
our revenue consists of interest and fees from our leases and  to a lesser extent  income from our property insurance program and other fee income 
our expenses consist of interest expense and operating expenses  which include salaries and benefits and other general and administrative expenses 
as a credit lender  our earnings are also significantly impacted by credit losses 
for the year ended december   our net credit losses were of our average net investment in leases 
we establish reserves for credit losses which require us to estimate expected losses in our portfolio 

table of contents our leases are classified as direct financing leases under generally accepted accounting principles  and we recognize interest income over the term of the lease 
direct financing leases transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the equipment lessee 
our investment in leases is reflected in our financial statements as net investment in direct financing leases 
net investment in direct financing leases consists of the sum of total minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual value of leased equipment  less unearned lease income 
unearned lease income consists of the excess of the total future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term plus deferred net initial direct costs and fees less the cost of the related equipment 
approximately of our lease portfolio amortizes over the term to a residual value 
for the remainder of the portfolio  we must estimate end of term residual values for the leased assets 
failure to correctly estimate residual values could result in losses being realized on the disposition of the equipment at the end of the lease term 
since our founding  we have funded our business through a combination of variable rate borrowings and fixed rate asset securitization transactions  as well as through the issuance from time to time of subordinated debt and equity 
our variable rate financing sources consist of a revolving bank facility and two cp conduit warehouse facilities 
we issue fixed rate term debt through the asset backed securitization market 
typically  leases are funded through variable rate borrowings until refinanced through term note securitization at fixed rates 
all of our term note securitizations have been accounted for as on balance sheet transactions and  therefore  we have not recognized gains or losses from these transactions 
as of december  million or of our borrowings were fixed rate term note securitizations 
since we initially finance our fixed rate leases with variable rate financing  our earnings are exposed to unexpected increases in interest rates that may occur before those variable rates can be hedged by a fixed rate term note securitization 
we use derivative contracts to attempt to reduce our exposure to increasing interest rates 
we generally benefit in times of falling and low interest rates 
we are also dependent upon obtaining future financing to refinance our warehouse lines of credit in order to grow our lease portfolio 
we currently plan to complete a fixed rate term note securitization at least once a year 
failure to obtain such financing  or other alternate financing  would significantly restrict our growth and future financial performance 
restatement following a review of our lease related accounting policies  the company determined that its accounting policy relating to the treatment of interim rent did not conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as a result  the company has changed the timing of the recognition and classification of interim rent  which represents rental payments paid by certain customers to cover the period between the installation of equipment and the commencement of the lease contract 
as a result  on march   our board of directors  including our audit committee  concluded to restate the company s financial statements for the years ended december  and december  and for the four quarters of fiscal and since its inception in  the company has recognized interim rent in fee income at the time it was invoiced  and it has described this practice in its prior financial statements 
the company  in consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm  kpmg llp  has determined that interim rent payments should be treated in the same manner as other fixed non cancelable contractual minimum lease payments due from lessees in determining the company s investment in direct financing leases 
this treatment will defer the recognition of income for financial statement purposes while increasing the amount of unearned income for balance sheet purposes at the inception of the lease 
the unearned income  net of initial direct origination costs  will be recognized over the lease term based on a constant periodic rate of return as interest income 
this change lowered earnings for from million or per diluted share as previously reported in the company s form k filing on february  to million or per diluted share 
this change relates principally to the timing of income recognition for financial statement purposes 
it is a non cash adjustment and will not have any impact on historical or future cash flows or any other aspect of the company s business 

table of contents the cumulative effect of this restatement from through the year ended december  was to reduce retained earnings by approximately million  and book value per common share by 
net investment in leases decreased approximately million related to the additional recorded unearned income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been revised for the effects of the restatement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
reorganization marlin leasing corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  on august   we incorporated marlin business services corp 
in pennsylvania 
on november   we reorganized our operations into a holding company structure by merging marlin leasing corporation with a wholly owned subsidiary of marlin business services corp 
as a result  all former shareholders of marlin leasing corporation became shareholders of marlin business services corp 
after the reorganization  marlin leasing corporation remains in existence as our primary operating subsidiary 
in anticipation of our public offering  on october   marlin leasing corporation s board of directors approved a stock split of its class a common stock at a ratio of shares for every one share of class a common stock in order to increase the number of shares of class a common stock authorized and issued 
all per share amounts and outstanding shares  including all common stock equivalents  such as stock options  warrants and convertible preferred stock  have been retroactively restated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the stock split 
the following steps to reorganize our operations into a holding company structure were taken prior to the completion of our initial public offering of common stock in november all classes of marlin leasing corporation s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted by their terms into class a common stock of marlin leasing corporation  all warrants to purchase class a common stock of marlin leasing corporation were exercised on a net issuance  or cashless  basis for class a common stock  and a selling shareholder exercised options to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
the exercise of warrants resulted in the issuance of  common shares on a net issuance basis  based on the initial public offering price of per share  all warrants to purchase class b common stock of marlin leasing corporation were exercised on a net issuance basis for class b common stock  and all class b common stock was converted by its terms into class a common stock  a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of marlin business services corp 
merged with and into marlin leasing corporation  and each share of marlin leasing corporation s class a common stock was exchanged for one share of marlin business services corp 
common stock under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated august   and the marlin leasing corporation equity compensation plan was assumed by  and merged into  the marlin business services corp 
equity compensation plan 
all outstanding options to purchase marlin leasing corporation s class a common stock under the plan were converted into options to purchase shares of common stock of marlin business services corp 
as a result of this reorganization   shares of marlin leasing corporation common stock were issued and outstanding prior to the merger with marlin business services corp 
and the initial public offering 
also  options to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding at that time under our equity compensation plan 

table of contents initial public offering in november   shares of our common stock were issued in connection with our ipo 
of these shares  a total of  shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by selling shareholders 
the initial public offering price was per share resulting in net proceeds to us  after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions but before other offering costs  of approximately million 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling shareholders 
we used the net proceeds from the ipo as follows i approximately million was used to repay all of our outstanding subordinated debt and all accrued interest thereon  ii approximately million was used to pay accrued dividends on preferred stock which converted to common stock at the time of the ipo  and iii approximately million was used to pay issuance costs incurred in connection with the ipo 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund newly originated and existing leases in our portfolio and other general business purposes 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including credit losses  residuals  initial direct costs and fees  other fees and realizability of deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 
our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies  the most significant of which are described below 
income recognition 
interest income is recognized under the effective interest method 
the effective interest method of income recognition applies a constant rate of interest equal to the internal rate of return on the lease 
when a lease is days or more delinquent  the lease is classified as being on non accrual and we do not recognize interest income on that lease until the lease is less than days delinquent 
fee income consists of fees for delinquent lease payments and cash collected on early termination of leases 
fee income also includes net residual income which includes income from lease renewals and gains and losses on the realization of residual values of equipment disposed of at the end of term 
fee income from delinquent lease payments is recognized on an accrual basis based on anticipated collection rates 
other fees are recognized when received 
net residual income includes charges for the reduction in estimated residual values on equipment for leases in renewal and is recognized during the renewal period 
residual balances at lease termination which remain uncollected more than days are charged against income 
insurance income is recognized on an accrual basis as earned over the term of the lease 
payments that are days or more past due are charged against income 
ceding commissions  losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded in the period incurred and netted against insurance income 
initial direct costs and fees 
we defer initial direct costs incurred and fees received to originate our leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the initial direct costs and fees we defer are part of the net investment in direct financing leases and are amortized to interest income using the effective interest method 
we defer third party commission costs as well as certain internal costs directly related to the origination activity 
the costs include evaluating the prospective lessee s financial condition  evaluating and recording guarantees and other security arrangements  negotiating lease terms  preparing and processing lease documents and closing the transaction 
the fees we defer are documentation fees collected at lease inception 

table of contents the realization of the deferred initial direct costs  net of fees deferred  is predicated on the net future cash flows generated by our lease portfolio 
lease residual values 
a direct financing lease is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual values less unearned income 
residual values reflect the estimated amounts to be received at lease termination from lease extensions  sales or other dispositions of leased equipment 
these estimates are based on industry data and on our experience 
management performs periodic reviews of the estimated residual values and any impairment  if other than temporary  is recognized in the current period 
allowance for credit losses 
we maintain an allowance for credit losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our existing lease portfolio as of the reporting dates based on our projection of probable net credit losses 
to project probable net credit losses  we perform a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts 
a migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that an account will progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately be charged off 
in addition to the migration analysis  we also consider other factors including recent trends in delinquencies and charge offs  accounts filing for bankruptcy  recovered amounts  forecasting uncertainties  the composition of our lease portfolio  economic conditions  and seasonality 
we then establish an allowance for credit losses for the projected probable net credit losses based on this analysis 
a provision is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the appropriate level 
our policy is to charge off against the allowance the estimated unrecoverable portion of accounts once they reach days delinquent 
our projections of probable net credit losses are inherently uncertain  and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such losses 
changes in economic conditions  the risk characteristics and composition of the portfolio  bankruptcy laws  and other factors could impact our actual and projected net credit losses and the related allowance for credit losses 
to the degree we add new leases to our portfolio  or to the degree credit quality is worse than expected  we will record expense to increase the allowance for credit losses for the estimated net losses expected in our lease portfolio 
derivatives 
sfas  as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires recognition of all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to the accounting standard 
for derivatives not designated or qualifying for hedge accounting  the related gain or loss is recognized in earnings for each period and included in other income or financing related costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivatives designated for hedge accounting  initial assessments are made as to whether the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective and on going periodic assessments may be required to determine the on going effectiveness of the hedge 
the gain or loss on derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting is recorded in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet net of tax effects unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges or in current period earnings depending on the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
warrants 
we issued warrants to purchase our common stock to the holders of our subordinated debt that was repaid in november in accordance with eitf issue no 
 codified in eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  we initially classified the warrants fair value as a liability since the warrant holders had the ability to put to the company the shares of common stock exercisable under the warrants under certain conditions to us for cash settlement 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the warrants were recorded in the accompanying statement of operations 
the charge to operations in was million 
under the terms of the warrant agreement  the warrants were exercised into common stock at the time of our ipo and the total warrant liability balance of million was reclassified back to equity and  therefore  there are no effects on operations in income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of 
table of contents items  for example  leases for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
our management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent our management believes recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance in a period  an expense must be recorded within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
our net operating loss carryforwards nols as of december  for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and  respectively 
the nols expire in periods beginning to the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the nols available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
a change in the ownership of a company greater than within a three year period results in an annual limitation on a company s ability to utilize its nols from tax periods prior to the ownership change 
management believes that the reorganization and initial public offering did not have a material effect on its ability to utilize these nols 
no valuation allowance has been established against net deferred tax assets related to our nols  as our management believes these nols will be realizable through reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  and future taxable income 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and net income 
net income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net income for was significantly impacted by recognition of million of expense relating to mark to market accounting of the fair value of warrants outstanding 
the warrants were exercised in conjunction with our ipo transaction in november and are no longer outstanding 
excluding the impact of the change in fair value of warrants  net income of million was an increase of million  or  compared to pro forma net income of million for the year our increased earnings are primarily the result of growth and improved net interest and fee margins in our core leasing business 
in we benefited from lower borrowing costs primarily due to a generally low interest rate environment and successful completion of our first aaa rated term securitization in july previous term transactions were issued with lower credit ratings

fee income as a percentage of average net investment in dfl  increased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to higher net residual income including income from lease extensions as more leases where we retain a residual interest reach end of term 
as a percentage of average net investment in dfl  net residual income was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in fees for delinquent lease payments late charges  which were the largest component of fee income  was as a percentage of average net investment in dfl for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in interest expense decreased million to million for the year period ended december  from million for the same period in interest expense  as a percentage of the average net investment in dfl  decreased basis points to annualized for the year period ended december  from

in july we issued million in term securitizations with an initial weighted average initial coupon of and in june we issued million in term securitizations at a weighted average coupon of 
insurance and other income 
insurance and other income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is primarily related to higher insurance income of  related to a increase in the number of insured accounts 
salaries and benefits expense 
salaries and benefits expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in compensation expense is attributable to increases in overall growth in personnel  merit and bonus payment increases 
total personnel increased to at december  from at december  in  sales compensation increased million related to additional hiring of sales account executives 
in addition  collection and operations salaries increased  related to additional personnel associated with growth in the lease portfolio

general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in insurance costs of  relating to higher directors and officers insurance costs and increased credit bureau charges of  other increases included audit and professional fees of  for the incremental costs associated with being a public company and sarbanes oxley compliance  investor relations expense of  franchise tax expense of  and occupancy expense of  due to the incremental costs of our new chicago office which opened in january and expansion of our denver and atlanta offices 
we also incurred  in non recurring expense in associated with the relocation of our new jersey office 
additionally  we spent more on recruiting and training  bank processing fees  data processing and postage as a result of increased lease originations and our overall growth 
financing related costs 
financing related costs include commitment fees paid to our financing sources and costs pertaining to our derivative contracts used to limit our exposure to possible increases in interest rates 
financing related costs increased  to million for the year period ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was due principally to higher costs associated with mark to market adjustments for derivative contracts in the period 
mark to market adjustments of  were recorded on derivatives for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  commitment fees were million for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  change in fair value of warrants 
warrants issued in connection with subordinated debt increased in value million during this non cash expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in the estimated fair market value of our common stock used in valuing our warrants 
as part of our reorganization 
table of contents undertaken in november  all outstanding warrants were exercised on a net issuance basis for common stock 
accordingly  this expense did not continue beyond fiscal year provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in our provision for credit losses was a result of growth of our lease portfolio and the corresponding proportional growth in net charge offs 
net charge offs were million for the period ended december  and million for the same period in net charge offs as a percentage of average net investment in leases increased to in from in given the overall economic environment for the periods reported  we expected net charge offs to approximate of average net investment in leases and consider our net charge off levels to be consistent with our expectations 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in tax expense is primarily attributed to the increase in pretax income 
our effective tax rate  which is a combination of federal and state income tax rates  was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate in was heavily impacted by the expense associated with the changes in fair value of warrants which is a non deductible expense 
we anticipate our effective tax rate in future years to approximate our effective tax rate

net interest and fee margin 
net interest and fee income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the net interest and fee margin represents an increase of basis points to for the year ended december  from for the same period in in  we benefited from a low interest rate environment as borrowing costs declined faster than the yield on assets 
interest income  net of amortized initial direct costs and fees  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to a growth in average net investment in direct financing leases which increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  our weighted average cost of borrowing declined basis points while our interest income yield declined less significantly  by basis points 
our ability to sustain pricing and increase our net interest and fee margin was due to a less competitive leasing environment and the amount of direct business recorded during the period 
fee income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in fee income resulted primarily from additional residual gains on lease terminations  which includes income from lease extensions  of  higher late fees earned of  and increases in early prepayment gains 
fee income  as a percentage of the average net investment in direct financing leases  declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  primarily due to lower average late fees earned as a result of lower delinquency levels in the lease portfolio 
interest expense increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for same period in interest expense  as a percentage of average net investment in direct financing leases  decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the same period in due to the declining interest rate environment and the resulting impact on our weighted average borrowing costs 
in june of we completed our fifth fixed rate term asset backed securitization debt issuance raising million at our lowest weighted average coupon done to date of 
this issuance along with the continued amortization of prior issues at higher coupons and the overall low interest rate environment that also kept variable rate warehouse borrowings low  combined to blend the overall costs of borrowing lower 
in conjunction with the ipo transaction  we also paid off million of coupon subordinated debt in november the early payoff of the subordinated debt resulted in a one time expense due to the recapture of  of unamortized discount and issuance costs in the fourth quarter of insurance and other income 
insurance and other income increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is primarily related to an increase in net insurance income of  related to a increase in the number of insured accounts offset by lower miscellaneous income earned in the period 
lessees are required by contract to insure their 
table of contents leased equipment naming us as a loss payee 
lessees may elect to satisfy this obligation through our insurance program  and we anticipate this activity will change proportionately with the lease portfolio 
salaries and benefits expense 
salaries and benefits expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in during  we continued to aggressively hire sales account executives 
for the year  compensation expense related to sales increased million or compared to other increases in compensation expense are attributable to merit increases and increases in other personnel to support the overall growth of the lease portfolio and the company 
total personnel increased to at december  from at december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in legal fees of  including costs and fees of  relating to the settlement of litigation 
audit expenses increased  due to increased external and internal audit services performed some of which related to our ipo transaction 
occupancy expenses increased  due in part to the opening of a  square foot office in philadelphia in june and the march move of our georgia office into larger space 
insurance expenses increased  due in part to more locations insured and higher directors and officers insurance coverage associated with being a public company 
marketing expenses increased  the remainder of the increase is due to increases in postage  training  bank fees  depreciation  data processing and credit bureau report costs to support the growth in our leasing portfolio 
financing related costs 
financing related costs were million for both the years ended december  and increases in of  in commitment fees were offset by lower costs associated with mark to market adjustments for interest rate cap contracts in the period 
change in fair value of warrants 
warrants issued in connection with subordinated debt increased in value million during compared with  during this non cash expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in the estimated fair market value of our common stock used in valuing our warrants 
as part of our reorganization undertaken in november  all outstanding warrants were exercised on a net issuance basis for common stock 
accordingly  this expense will not continue beyond fiscal year provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in our provision for credit losses was principally a result of the growth of our lease portfolio 
net charge offs were million for the period ended december  and million for the same period in net charge offs as a percentage of average net investment in leases declined to in from in we generally expect our annual net charge offs to approximate of average net investment in leases 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is directly attributable to the increase in pretax income 
our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rates in both and were heavily impacted by the expense associated with the changes in fair value of warrants which is a non deductible expense 

table of contents earnings per common share in conjunction with our november reorganization and ipo  warrants were exercised and convertible preferred stock converted  and our capital structure simplified into one class of common stock outstanding 
the number of common shares issued as a result of these conversions was million  or approximately of total common shares outstanding following the ipo 
because of the significant impact on share count and the related impact on operations from warrant valuations and preferred dividends  we believe a pro forma analysis of diluted eps provides a more meaningful basis to evaluate performance of the company 
the following analysis reconciles eps calculations on a gaap basis to pro forma eps which assumes the exercise of the of warrants and the conversion of the convertible preferred stock as of the beginning of the periods reported and adds back warrant expenses and preferred dividends in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  restated restated net income attributable to common stockholders used for basic eps preferred stock dividends adjusted net earnings used for diluted eps weighted average common shares outstanding used for basic eps effect of dilutive securities stock options and warrants convertible preferred stock adjusted weighted average common shares and assumed conversions used for diluted eps net earnings per common share gaap basic diluted pro forma earnings per share adjusted net earnings used for diluted eps change in fair value of warrants preferred stock dividends adjusted net earnings adjusted weighted average common shares and assumed conversions used for diluted eps effect of warrants effect of preferred stock pro forma weighted average shares used for diluted eps pro forma diluted eps the effects of convertible preferred stock in were deemed anti dilutive and  therefore  not considered in gaap diluted eps calculations

expenses are monitored by departmental heads and are reviewed by senior management monthly

residual performance our leases offer our end user customers the option to own the purchased equipment at lease expiration 
as of december   approximately of our leases were one dollar purchase option leases  were fair market value leases and were fixed purchase option leases  the latter of which typically are of the original equipment cost 
as of december   there were million of residual assets retained on our balance sheet of which million or were related to copiers 
our leases generally include automatic renewal provisions and many leases continue beyond their initial term 
we consider renewal income a component of residual performance 
for the years ended december    and renewal income  net of depreciation amounted to million  million  and million and net gains losses on residual values disposed at end of term amounted to   and  respectively 
the increase in net residual income is generally consistent with the growth in our lease portfolio and an increased number of leases where we retain a residual interest reaching end of term

given the overall economic environment for the periods reported  we expected net charge offs to approximate of average net investment in leases and consider our annualized net charge off levels reported to be consistent with our expectations 
liquidity and capital resources our business requires a substantial amount of cash to operate and grow 
our primary liquidity need is for new lease originations 
in addition  we need liquidity to pay interest and principal on our borrowings  to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with our securitization transactions  to fund infrastructure and technology investment and to pay administrative and other operating expenses 
we are dependent upon the availability of financing from a variety of funding sources to satisfy these liquidity needs 
historically  we have relied upon four principal types of third party financing to fund our operations borrowings under a revolving bank facility  financing of leases in cp conduit warehouse facilities  financing of leases through term note securitizations  and equity and debt securities with third party investors 
new lease originations are generally funded in the short term with cash from operations or through borrowings under our revolving bank facility or our cp conduit warehouse facilities 
our current plans assume the execution of a term note securitization approximately once a year to refinance and relieve the bank and cp 
table of contents conduit warehouse facilities 
as of december  we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity under our existing bank and cp conduit warehouse facilities 
in november   shares of our common stock were issued in connection with our ipo 
of these shares  a total of  shares were sold by the company and  shares were sold by selling shareholders 
the initial public offering price was per share resulting in net proceeds to us  after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions but before other offering costs  of approximately million 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling shareholders 
we used the net proceeds from the ipo as follows i approximately million was used to repay all of our outstanding subordinated debt and all accrued interest thereon  ii approximately million was used to pay accrued dividends on preferred stock which converted to common stock at the time of the ipo  iii approximately million was used to pay issuance costs incurred in connection with the ipo 
the remaining million was used to fund newly originated and existing leases in our portfolio and other general business purposes 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we used cash in investing activities of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities primarily relate to lease origination activity 
additional liquidity is provided by our cash flow from operations 
we generated cash flow from operations of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect cash from operations  additional borrowings on existing and future credit facilities and  the completion of additional on balance sheet term note securitizations to be adequate to support our operations and projected growth 
cash and cash equivalents 
our objective is to maintain a low cash balance  investing any free cash in leases 
we generally fund our lease originations and growth using advances under our revolving bank facility and our cp conduit warehouse facilities 
we had available cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million at december  in addition we had million of cash classified as restricted cash as of december  compared to million at december  restricted cash consists primarily of the cash reserves and advance payment accounts related to our term note securitizations 
borrowings 
our aggregate outstanding secured borrowings amounted to million at december  and million at december  at december   our external financing sources  maximum facility amounts  amounts outstanding and unused available commitments  subject to certain minimum equity restrictions and other covenants and conditions  are summarized below for the months ended december  as of december  maximum maximum month end average weighted weighted facility amount amount average amounts average unused amount outstanding outstanding coupon outstanding coupon capacity dollars in thousands revolving bank facility cp conduit warehouse facilities term note securitizations 
table of contents subject to lease eligibility and borrowing base formula 
our term note securitizations are one time fundings that pay down over time without any ability for us to draw down additional amounts 
as of december   we had completed six on balance sheet term note securitizations and repaid three in their entirety 
revolving bank facility 
our revolving bank facility  which increased from million to million on october  through the addition of another lender to the facility  is secured by leases that meet specified eligibility criteria 
our revolving bank facility provides temporary funding pending the accumulation of sufficient pools of leases for financing through a cp conduit warehouse facility or an on balance sheet term note securitization 
funding under this facility is based on a borrowing base formula and factors in an assumed discount rate and advance rate against the pledged leases 
our weighted average outstanding borrowings under this facility were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we incurred interest expense under this facility of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this facility expires on august  as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving bank facility 
cp conduit warehouse facilities 
we have two cp conduit warehouse facilities that allow us to borrow  repay and re borrow based on a borrowing base formula 
in these transactions  we transfer pools of leases and interests in the related equipment to special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries 
these special purpose entities in turn pledge their interests in the leases and related equipment to an unaffiliated conduit entity  which generally issues commercial paper to investors 
these facilities are also credit enhanced through third party financial guarantor s insurance policies 
these financing arrangements have minimum annual fee requirements based on anticipated usage of the facilities 
our million cp conduit warehouse facility is secured by leases that meet specified eligibility criteria 
we obtain funding under this facility through a special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiary to which we transfer eligible leases 
funding under this facility is based on a borrowing base formula and factors in an assumed discount rate and advance rate against the pledged collateral combined with specific portfolio concentration criteria 
as of december   the maximum advance rate under this facility was of our borrowing base 
interest on borrowings under the facility is charged at a floating rate based on commercial paper rates and averaged for the year ended december  our weighted average outstanding borrowings under this facility were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we incurred interest expense under this facility of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this facility expires on october  our second cp conduit warehouse facility is also secured by leases that meet specified eligibility criteria 
on march   we closed on an amendment to increase this facility size to million 
we obtain funding under this facility through a special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiary to which we transfer eligible leases

since our founding  we have completed six on balance sheet term note securitizations of which three remain outstanding 
in connection with each securitization transaction  we have transferred leases to our wholly owned  special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and issued term debt collateralized by such commercial leases to institutional investors in private securities offerings 
our term note 
table of contents securitizations differ from our cp conduit warehouse facilities primarily in that our term note securitizations have fixed terms  fixed interest rates and fixed principal amounts 
by entering into term note securitizations  we reduce outstanding borrowings under our cp conduit warehouse facilities and revolving bank facility  which increases the amounts available to us under these facilities to fund additional lease originations 
our series transaction  which was our first term note securitization  was repaid in full on january  our series transaction was repaid in full on april   and our transaction was repaid in full on august  as of december   million of our net investment in direct financing leases was pledged to our term note securitizations

certain classes of the term note securitization were issued at variable rates to investors with the company simultaneously entering interest rate swap agreements to convert the borrowings to a fixed interest cost 
for the weighted average term of the term note securitization  the weighted average coupon rate will approximate 
financial covenants all of our secured borrowing arrangements have financial covenants we must comply with in order to obtain funding through the facilities and to avoid an event of default 
the revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities also contain cross default provisions such that an event of default on any facility would be considered an event of default under the others  in essence simultaneously restricting our ability to access either of these critical sources of funding 
a default by any of our term note securitizations is also 
table of contents considered an event of default under the revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities 
some of the critical financial covenants under our borrowing arrangements as of december  include tangible net worth of not less than million  debt to equity ratio of not more than to  fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  and interest coverage ratio of not less than to as of december  we believe we were in compliance with all covenants in our borrowing relationships 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our credit facilities and term debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases 
the contractual obligations under our agreements  credit facilities  term securitizations  operating leases and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december  were as follows contractual obligations as of december  operating leased capital borrowings leases facilities leases total dollars in thousands thereafter total market interest rate risk and sensitivity market risk is the risk of losses arising from changes in values of financial instruments 
we engage in transactions in the normal course of business that expose us to market risks 
we attempt to mitigate such risks through prudent management practices and strategies such as attempting to match the expected cash flows of our assets and liabilities 
we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates and our earnings may fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
the lease assets we originate are almost entirely fixed rate 
accordingly  we generally seek to finance these assets with fixed interest cost term note securitization borrowings that we issue periodically 
between term note securitization issues  we finance our new lease originations through a combination of variable rate warehouse facilities and working capital 
our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings and our exposure to interest rate risk changes over time 
over the past twelve months  the mix of variable rate borrowings has ranged from zero to of total borrowings and averaged 
our highest exposure to variable rate borrowings generally occurs just prior to the issuance of a term note securitization 
we also use derivative financial instruments to attempt to further reduce our exposure to changing cash flows caused by possible changes in interest rates 
on july  we issued a term note securitization where certain classes of notes were issued at variable rates to investors 
we simultaneously entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert these borrowings to fixed interest costs to the company for the term of the borrowing 
the notional amount of these swaps reduce over time in conjunction with the amortization of the related notes 
as of december  the notional amount of these swap agreements was million 
at december  we did not have any such swap agreements outstanding 

table of contents we may also use interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to changing market interest rates prior to issuing a term note securitization 
in this scenario we usually enter into forward starting swap agreements to coincide with the forecasted pricing date of our next term note securitization 
the value of this derivative moves directly with interest rates and our intention is to close these derivative contracts simultaneous with the pricing of our next term securitization and amortize the resulting gain or loss to interest expense over the term of our forecasted securitization 
we may choose to hedge all or a portion of a forecasted transaction 
in october and december we entered forward starting swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to partially hedge our forecasted term securitization 
at december  we did not have any such swap agreements outstanding 
to provide additional protection against potential interest rate increases associated with our variable rate warehouse borrowing facilities  we are required by our cp conduit warehouse facilities to enter into derivative financial transactions 
we are using interest rate caps to fulfill these requirements 
as of december   we held interest rate caps with a notional amount of million with several counterparties at various terms and the fair value of these contracts was  the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations

the revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities are charged a floating rate of interest based on libor  prime rate or commercial paper interest rates 
because our assets are fixed rate  increases in these market interest rates would negatively impact earnings and decreases in the rates would positively impact earnings because the rate charged on our borrowings would change faster than our assets could reprice 
we would have to offset increases in borrowing costs by adjusting the pricing under our new leases or our net interest margin would be reduced 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset higher borrowing costs with increased pricing of our assets 

table of contents for example  the impact of a hypothetical basis point  or  increase in the market rates for which our borrowings are indexed for the twelve month period ended december  would have been to reduce net interest and fee income by approximately  based on our average variable rate warehouse borrowings of approximately million for the year then ended  excluding the effects of derivatives  taxes and possible increases in the yields from our lease portfolio due to the origination of new leases at higher interest rates 
we manage and monitor our exposure to interest rate risk using balance sheet simulation models 
such models incorporate many of our assumptions about our business including new asset production and pricing  interest rate forecasts  overhead expense forecasts and assumed credit losses 
past experience drives many of the assumptions used in our simulation models and actual results could vary substantially

risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report and other periodic statements we make 
if we cannot obtain external financing  we may be unable to fund our operations 
our business requires a substantial amount of cash to operate 
our cash requirements will increase if our lease originations increase 
we historically have obtained a substantial amount of the cash required for operations through a variety of external financing sources  such as borrowings under our revolving bank facility  financing of leases through commercial paper cp conduit warehouse facilities  and term note securitizations 
a failure to renew or increase the funding commitment under our existing cp conduit warehouse facilities or add new cp conduit warehouse facilities could affect our ability to refinance leases originated through our revolving bank facility and  accordingly  our ability to fund and originate new leases 
an inability to complete term note securitizations would result in our inability to refinance amounts outstanding under our cp conduit warehouse facilities and revolving bank facility and would also negatively impact our ability to originate and service new leases 
our ability to complete cp conduit transactions and term note securitization  as well as obtain renewals of lenders commitments  is affected by a number of factors  including conditions in the securities and asset backed securities markets  conditions in the market for commercial bank liquidity support for cp programs  compliance of our leases with the eligibility requirements established in connection with our cp conduit warehouse facilities and term note securitizations  including the level of lease delinquencies and defaults  and our ability to service the leases 
we are and will continue to be dependent upon the availability of credit from these external financing sources to continue to originate leases and to satisfy our other working capital needs 
we may be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all  as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time  including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under existing financing arrangements 
if any or all of our funding sources become unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  we may not have access to the financing necessary to conduct our business  which would limit our ability to fund our operations 
we do not have long term commitments from any of our current funding sources 
as a result  we may be unable to continue to access these or other funding sources 
in the event we seek to obtain equity financing  our shareholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities 
this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities 

table of contents our financing sources impose covenants  restrictions and default provisions on us  which could lead to termination of our financing facilities  acceleration of amounts outstanding under our financing facilities and our removal as servicer 
the legal agreements relating to our revolving bank facility  our cp conduit warehouse facilities and our term note securitizations contain numerous covenants  restrictions and default provisions relating to  among other things  maximum lease delinquency and default levels  a minimum net worth requirement and a maximum debt to equity ratio 
in addition  a change in our chief executive officer or president is an event of default under our revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities unless we hire a replacement acceptable to our lenders within days 
such a change is also an immediate event of servicer termination under our term note securitizations 
a merger or consolidation with another company in which we are not the surviving entity  likewise  is an event of default under our financing facilities 
further  our revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities contain cross default provisions whereby certain defaults under one facility would also be an event of default under the other facilities 
an event of default under the revolving bank facility or a cp conduit warehouse facility could result in termination of further funds being made available under these facilities 
an event of default under any of our facilities could result in an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the facilities  foreclosure on all or a portion of the leases financed by the facilities and or our removal as a servicer of the leases financed by the facility 
this would reduce our revenues from servicing and  by delaying any cash payment allowed to us under the financing facilities until the lenders have been paid in full  reduce our liquidity and cash flow 
if we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our end user customers  we may experience a higher number of lease defaults  which may restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and reduce our earnings 
we specialize in leasing equipment to small businesses 
small businesses may be more vulnerable than large businesses to economic downturns  typically depend upon the management talents and efforts of one person or a small group of persons and often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete 
small business leases  therefore  may entail a greater risk of delinquencies and defaults than leases entered into with larger  more creditworthy leasing customers 
in addition  there is typically only limited publicly available financial and other information about small businesses and they often do not have audited financial statements 
accordingly  in making credit decisions  our underwriting guidelines rely upon the accuracy of information about these small businesses obtained from the small business owner and or third party sources  such as credit reporting agencies 
if the information we obtain from small business owners and or third party sources is incorrect  our ability to make appropriate credit decisions will be impaired 
if we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our end user customers  we may experience a higher number of lease defaults and related decreases in our earnings 
defaulted leases and certain delinquent leases also do not qualify as collateral against which initial advances may be made under our revolving bank facility or cp conduit warehouse facilities  and we cannot include them in our term note securitizations 
an increase in delinquencies or lease defaults could reduce the funding available to us under our facilities and could adversely affect our earnings  possibly materially 
in addition  increasing rates of delinquencies or charge offs could result in adverse changes in the structure of our future financing facilities  including increased interest rates payable to investors and the imposition of more burdensome covenants and credit enhancement requirements 
any of these occurrences may cause us to experience reduced earnings 
if we are unable to effectively manage any future growth  we may suffer material operating losses 
we have grown our lease originations and overall business significantly since we commenced operations 
however  our ability to continue to increase originations at a comparable rate depends upon our ability to implement our disciplined growth strategy and upon our ability to evaluate  finance and service increasing volumes of leases of suitable yield and credit quality 
accomplishing such a result on a cost effective basis is largely a function of our marketing capabilities  our management of the leasing process  our credit underwriting guidelines  our ability to provide competent  attentive and efficient servicing to our end user customers  our access to financing sources on acceptable terms and our ability to attract and retain high quality employees in all areas of our business 
even if we are able to continue our growth in lease originations  our future success will be dependent upon our ability to manage our growth 
among the factors we would need to manage are the training  
table of contents supervision and integration of new employees  as well as the development of infrastructure  systems and procedures within our origination  underwriting  servicing  collections and financing functions in a manner which enables us to maintain higher volume in originations 
failure to effectively manage these and other factors related to growth in originations and our overall operations may cause us to suffer material operating losses 
if losses from leases exceed our allowance for credit losses  our operating income will be reduced or eliminated 
in connection with our financing of leases  we record an allowance for credit losses to provide for estimated losses 
our allowance for credit losses is based on  among other things  past collection experience  industry data  lease delinquency data and our assessment of prospective collection risks 
determining the appropriate level of the allowance is an inherently uncertain process and therefore our determination of this allowance may prove to be inadequate to cover losses in connection with our portfolio of leases 
factors that could lead to the inadequacy of our allowance may include our inability to effectively manage collections  unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific leasing customers  industries or geographic areas 
losses in excess of our allowance for credit losses would cause us to increase our provision for credit losses  reducing or eliminating our operating income 
if we cannot effectively compete within the equipment leasing industry  we may be unable to increase our revenues or maintain our current levels of operations 
the business of small ticket equipment leasing is highly fragmented and competitive 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
for example  some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us 
a lower cost of funds could enable a competitor to offer leases with yields that are lower than those we use to price our leases  potentially forcing us to decrease our yields or lose origination volume 
in addition  certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments  which could allow them to establish more origination source and end user customer relationships and increase their market share 
there are few barriers to entry with respect to our business and  therefore  new competitors could enter the business of small ticket equipment leasing at any time 
the companies that typically provide financing for large ticket or middle market transactions could begin competing with us on small ticket equipment leases 
if this occurs  or we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  we may be unable to sustain our operations at their current levels or generate revenue growth 
if we cannot maintain our relationships with origination sources  our ability to generate lease transactions and related revenues may be significantly impeded 
we have formed relationships with thousands of origination sources  comprised primarily of independent equipment dealers and  to a lesser extent  lease brokers 
we rely on these relationships to generate lease applications and originations 
we invest significant time and resources in establishing and maintaining these relationships 
most of these relationships are not formalized in written agreements and those that are formalized by written agreements are typically terminable at will 
our typical relationship does not commit the origination source to provide a minimum number of lease transactions to us nor does it require the origination source to direct all of its lease transactions to us 
the decision by a significant number of our origination sources to refer their leasing transactions to another company could impede our ability to generate lease transactions and related revenues 
if interest rates change significantly  we may be subject to higher interest costs on future term note securitizations and we may be unable to effectively hedge our variable rate borrowings  which may cause us to suffer material losses 
because we generally fund our leases through a revolving bank facility  cp conduit warehouse facilities and term note securitizations  our margins could be reduced by an increase in interest rates 
each of our leases is structured so that the sum of all scheduled lease payments will equal the cost of the equipment to us  less the residual  plus a return on the amount of our investment 
this return is known as the yield 
the yield on our leases is fixed because the scheduled payments are fixed at the time of lease origination 
when we originate or acquire leases  we base our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the yield on each lease and the effective interest rate we expect to pay when we finance the lease 
to the extent that a lease is financed with variable rate funding  increases in interest rates during the term of a lease could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
a negative spread is an interest cost greater than the yield on the lease 
currently  our revolving bank facility and our cp conduit warehouse facilities have 
table of contents variable rates based on libor  prime rate or commercial paper interest rates 
as a result  because our assets have a fixed interest rate  increases in libor  prime rate or commercial paper interest rates would negatively impact our earnings 
if interest rates increase faster than we are able to adjust the pricing under our new leases  our net interest margin would be reduced 
as required under our financing facility agreements  we enter into interest rate cap agreements to hedge against the risk of interest rate increases in our cp conduit warehouse facilities 
if our hedging strategies are imperfectly implemented or if a counterparty defaults on a hedging agreement  we could suffer losses relating to our hedging activities 
in addition  with respect to our fixed rate borrowings  such as our term note securitizations  increases in interest rates could have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs on future term note transactions 
deteriorated economic or business conditions may lead to greater than anticipated lease defaults and credit losses  which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and reduce our operating income 
our operating income may be reduced by various economic factors and business conditions  including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate 
delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 
because we extend credit primarily to small businesses  many of our customers may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to make scheduled lease payments during these periods 
therefore  to the extent that economic activity or business conditions deteriorate  our delinquencies and credit losses may increase 
unfavorable economic conditions may also make it more difficult for us to maintain both our new lease origination volume and the credit quality of new leases at levels previously attained 
unfavorable economic conditions could also increase our funding costs or operating cost structure  limit our access to the securitization and other capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us 
any of these events could reduce our operating income 
the departure of any of our key management personnel or our inability to hire suitable replacements for our management may result in defaults under our financing facilities  which could restrict our ability to access funding and effectively operate our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team 
a change in our chief executive officer or president is an event of default under our revolving bank facility and cp conduit warehouse facilities unless we hire a replacement acceptable to our lenders within days 
such a change is also an immediate event of servicer termination under our term note securitizations 
the departure of any of our executive officers or key employees could limit our access to funding and ability to operate our business effectively 
the termination or interruption of  or a decrease in volume under  our property insurance program would cause us to experience lower revenues and may result in a significant reduction in our net income 
our end user customers are required to obtain all risk property insurance for the replacement value of the leased equipment
