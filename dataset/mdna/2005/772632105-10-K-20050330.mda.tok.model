item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this document 
overview rock of ages is an integrated quarrier  manufacturer  distributor and retailer of granite and products manufactured from granite 
during  we had three business segments  quarrying  manufacturing  and retail 
the quarry division sells granite blocks both to the manufacturing division and to outside manufacturers  as well as to customers outside north america 
the manufacturing division s principal product is granite memorials used primarily in cemeteries  although it also manufactures some specialized granite products for industrial applications 
the retail division primarily sells granite memorials directly to consumers 
during  we also had a fourth business segment  cemeteries 
the cemetery division sold cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
on december   we sold all of our cemetery properties and assets to saber management  llc for  thereby exiting the cemetery business 
we recorded a gain of  in after taxes and accounted for the transaction as a sale of discontinued operations 
our quarry division performed well in  with a increase in revenue and a increase in operating income over we had improved results from our pennsylvania black quarry over as we continued to work through the difficult geological formation in the quarry that increased costs and hurt the production of saleable blocks last year 
we also saw significant increased sales in from our gardenia white quarry primarily to overseas customers  especially in china 
we also continue to experience strong demand in for our bethel white granite  primarily from overseas customers 
demand for our salisbury pink granite was somewhat weaker in from  due in large part to the completion of the supply of a large project in dubai in  but demand is still within what we consider normal demand fluctuations 
in  we also made a million payment to eurimex as a result of an adverse judgment in the eurimex arbitration proceeding 
while we were disappointed with the verdict  the decision to terminate our relationship with eurimex in has given us control over the worldwide distribution of our granite that has been critical to our success in selling overseas and our increased quarry operating profits 
we have classified and presented the million payment and all legal fees and expenses associated with the eurimex arbitration proceeding in all years as a separate line on the income statement labeled adverse judgment and legal expenses 
our manufacturing division benefited in from an increase in shipments from our industrial products group but saw a slight decline in shipments of memorial products in the us  primarily as a result of several mausoleums and other larger estate and feature memorials which were completed at year end but could not be shipped due to customer and or cemetery delays 
such large memorials generally have higher than average profit margins so the decrease in shipments of these products caused our gross margins to decrease compared to finally  our sales general and administrative sg a costs increased primarily as a result of an increase in our sales force as part of our intensified efforts to attract a greater number of authorized rock of ages retailers 
we made higher than average investments in equipment in our manufacturing division in in an effort to meet the current and anticipated demand for our products as we work to grow our manufacturing and retail operations as well as to improve efficiency and our cost structure in order to remain competitive 
we expect capital spending in this area to return to historical levels going forward 
the current climate for manufacturing is very competitive  with imported products becoming more common 
we will continue to utilize and further explore outsourcing relationships including importing from areas like china and india as appropriate 
revenues in our retail segment were up very slightly over and although the increase was modest  we were pleased that it reversed the recent trend of year over year declining retail revenues 
unfortunately  retail operating income declined significantly compared to primarily as a result of the combination of severance payments in connection with changes in our management group and additional sales expense relating to changes in the compensation structure for our retail sales counselors from a commission basis to salary plus bonus basis 
when retail operating income is adjusted for these two events which total approximately  we believe the results in retail in were substantially equal to those in in  we implemented significant changes in our retail division as we restructured the management group by hiring a new chief operating officer of the memorials division which includes the manufacturing and retail segments  a new senior vice president of marketing  and by effecting numerous other changes such as modifications to our product mix  branding strategy  marketing plan  retail counselor compensation structure  pricing policy  and other items 
our future success depends on increasing revenues from our existing retail stores through outreach programs with funeral homes and cemeteries to maximize revenues per store by expanding share and market area 
in addition  we continue to work to expand and improve the distribution of our product through our owned stores  authorized dealers  funeral homes  and cemeteries 
we believe these changes were necessary based on the performance of the retail segment to date and the important market opportunity we believe exists at the retail level 
these changes  and the programs put in place as a result  represent a significant increase in effort and resources devoted to growing our retail business and as a result we expect operating results for the segment may suffer in the short term as we invest in people and programs in anticipation of future revenue growth 
critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred income taxes  contingencies and accounting for pensions 
revenue recognition the company records revenues from quarrying  manufacturing  retailing and through december  cemeteries 
quarry division the granite we quarry is sold both to outside customers and used by our manufacturing group 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from sales of granite blocks to outside customers when the granite is shipped from the quarry 
we provide a discount for domestic customers if payment is made within days of purchase  except in the case of december terms described below 
sales to foreign customers are typically secured by a letter of credit 
at our barre  vermont quarries  we allow customers to purchase granite blocks and request that we store the blocks for them 
many of our customers do not have adequate storage space at their facilities and want to ensure an adequate supply of blocks  especially when the barre quarries are closed from mid december through mid march because of weather 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from blocks purchased when the customer selects and identifies the block at the quarry site and the customer requests the block be stored  when they have significant business reasons to do so 
at that time  the block is removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the block  and title and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
the customer is invoiced and normal payment terms apply  except in the case of december terms described below 
granite blocks owned by customers remain on our property for varying periods of time after title passes to the buyer 
we retain a delivery obligation using our trucks 
however  we consider the earnings process substantially complete because the cost of delivery service is inconsequential less than in relation to the selling price 
further  under industry terms of trade  title passes and the payment obligation is established when the block is identified at the quarry 
each december  we offer special december payment terms to our barre quarries customers 
as noted above  from approximately mid december to approximately mid march  our barre quarries are closed due to weather 
during this time  the quarry customers manufacturing plants remain open  and many prefer to ensure they own blocks of a size and quality selected by them prior to the quarries closure 
all blocks purchased in december are invoiced on or about december and  at that time  the blocks are removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the blocks  and title and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
payment terms are one third of the invoice amount on january  one third on february  and one third on march the program provides essentially the normal day payment terms during the months when the barre quarries are closed notwithstanding the customer purchases a three month supply in december and makes payments over days 
customers need not use these special december terms and may buy from inventory during the closure period on a first come  first served basis with the normal day payment terms 
manufacturing rock of ages does not record a sale  nor do we record gross profit  at the time granite is transferred to the manufacturing division from our quarries 
we record revenue and gross profit related to internally transferred granite only after the granite is manufactured into a finished product and sold to an outside customer 
manufacturing revenues related to outside customers are recorded when the finished product is shipped from our facilities 
manufacturing revenues related to internally transferred finished products to our owned retail outlets are recorded when ultimately sold at retail to an outside customer 
retail retailing revenues are recorded when the finished monument is set in the cemetery 
in certain instances  we may enter into an agreement with a customer that provides for extended payments terms  generally up to two years from either the date of setting the memorial or  in certain instances  upon the settlement of an estate 
cemetery division the cemetery division was sold on december  accordingly  the operating results of the cemetery division have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in  the cemetery division s revenue from preneed sales of cemetery services and merchandise was deferred until the period in which the services or merchandise was delivered 
on the balance sheet the full contract amount is included in prearranged deferred revenue  a liability 
the corresponding receivable due from the customer was reflected in prearranged receivables  an asset  and the corresponding cash received from the customer was reflected partly in prearranged receivables for the portion placed in trust and partly in cash for the portion the company is allowed to retain 
indirect costs of marketing were expensed in the period in which they were incurred 
when the service or merchandise was delivered  we recognized as revenue the full contract amount plus all trust earnings associated with that contract 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or change in utilization of property and equipment 
recoverability of the undepreciated cost of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale at the end of its depreciation period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our services  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
effective january   we assessed impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require a two step test be performed 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit will be compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
upon implementation of sfas no 
 we determined the fair value of each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
this evaluation indicated goodwill recorded in the retail and cemetery segments was impaired as of january  accordingly  we completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  and recognized a million non cash charge  recorded as of january   as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write down of goodwill to its fair value 
approximately million of the goodwill write down is deductible for taxes 
therefore a deferred tax asset of million has been recorded 
there were two major factors that contributed to the goodwill impairment in the retail segment 
first  we underestimated the amount of time required to fully integrate the branding strategy through the retail network 
second  we had difficulty increasing profitability in the timeframe expected and to the extent we anticipated prior to the retail acquisitions 
the major factors that contributed to the goodwill impairment in the cemetery segment were lower than expected revenues and greater than expected selling and administrative costs 
we have entered into arrangements whereby we accepted a promissory note as partial or full payment for certain transactions  particularly the sale of an operation 
such notes have varying terms with principal and interest paid to the company over a period of generally not more than five years 
while most notes are secured by an interest in real property and or assets  management must make estimates and judgments as to the collectibility of such promissory notes 
such judgments depend on many factors including current and future economic conditions  the financial condition of the debtor as well as our estimate of the net realizable value of the security interest securing the note 
in  we wrote off  of a note receivable related to a non core manufacturing operation in elberton we sold in in accordance with an agreement reached with the buyer of that facility in connection with the termination of a supply agreement whereby we agreed to buy memorials from the buyer 
we believe we have accurately assessed the collectibility of these assets  however  the above factors and other factors may cause our accounting estimates concerning the collectibility of the notes to change and future operating results could be materially impacted 
valuation of deferred income taxes as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against the alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards and other deferred tax assets 
based upon the projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not we will realize the benefit of these unreserved net deferred tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
contingencies we are involved in various types of legal proceedings from time to time 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and risks  including  but not limited to  court rulings  judgments  negotiations between affected parties and government action 
management  with the assistance of its outside advisors  assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
accounting for pensions we provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of our employees 
accounting for these plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions including estimates on the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rates 
in we decreased the discount rate used to determine our liability in the pension plan from to based on a bond matching model which uses data on individual high quality corporate bonds and the timing and amount of the future benefit payments in our plan to develop a weighted discount rate specific to our plan 
in order to make informed assumptions  we rely on outside actuarial experts as well as public market data and general economic information 
any changes in one or more of these assumptions may materially affect certain amounts reported on our balance sheet 
in particular  a further decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or a decrease in discount rate could result in an increase in our pension liability and a charge to equity as well as increases in pension expenses over time 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain historical statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues with the exception of quarrying  manufacturing and retailing gross profit  which are shown as a percentage of quarrying  manufacturing and retailing revenues  respectively 
year ended december  statement of operations data net revenues quarrying manufacturing retailing total net revenues gross profit quarrying manufacturing retailing total gross profit selling  general administrative expenses impairment of note receivable adverse judgment and legal expenses income loss from continuing operations foreign exchange loss gain interest expense income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles discontinued operations income loss before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue increased  gross profit increased and total selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for the year ended december  increased from primarily as a result of increased shipments from our gardenia white and pennsylvania black quarries as well as an increase in shipments from our galactic blue quarry in the ukraine 
both gardenia white and bethel white remain very popular export granites and our improved production of gardenia white provided greater stone available for sale 
recoveries in our pennsylvania black quarry improved in as we progressed through a difficult part of the quarry  which also provided us with greater production and higher sales 
finally  our new venture in the galactic blue quarry in the ukraine has continued to improve production  which also led to higher revenues 
these increases in revenue were somewhat offset by a decrease in revenue from our salisbury pink quarry where demand for that export product was somewhat lower than anticipated 
demand for salisbury pink may be somewhat soft in  as worldwide inventories of pink granite blocks are somewhat high 
our barre gray quarry continues to face competition from imported granites  especially colored granites  which may decrease demand for this quarry over time  however revenue levels in were relatively consistent with gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for the year ended december  increased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to from the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of higher revenues and higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue in our pennsylvania black quarry as well as smaller increases in our gardenia white quarry as a result of higher revenues 
these increases were offset by a decrease in gross profit in our bethel white quarry due to higher than normal repair and maintenance expenses in sg a costs in our quarry segment for increased from primarily due to increased travel expenses required to support our granite exports as well as higher bonus payments paid to quarry personnel for the improved results 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing group for the year ended december  increased from the increase was primarily a result of greater shipments from our precision products group as a result of greater demand for their products 
demand for these products generally follow purchasing in the high technology industry and we anticipate demand will continue its modest improvement in the coming year 
this increase was offset by a decrease in shipments from the memorials group primarily as a result of not being able to ship approximately  in mausoleums and estate memorials in the fourth quarter of due to incomplete foundations  which are the responsibility of the customer 
we have begun making significant investments in people and programs to promote  both our standard memorial products as well as mausoleums and estate memorials  which we believe should result in increased revenues in gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group declined and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased for the year ended december  compared to the slight decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in shipments from the memorials group  especially the larger and more expensive memorials  mausoleums and estate memorials 
sg a costs for the manufacturing group were up over last year primarily as a result of increased sales personnel hired in the memorials group in order to implement our growth plans 
retail segment analysis revenues in our retail operations were marginally higher than last year  and while this is not a significant improvement in dollars  we are pleased that the retail group reversed the trend of declining revenues since as described in item under overview we implemented significant changes in our retail division 
while the changes have been helpful in stabilizing our core market in the short term  some of these changes  including a new chief operating officer  a change in compensation structure  changes to our product offerings and pricing  among other things  may have distracted our sales force somewhat 
we continue to make significant changes in how we approach our markets and are implementing programs which we believe should lead to significant future growth in our retail operations 
gross profit dollars for the retail operations in was essentially unchanged from and gross profit as a percentage of revenue was also essentially unchanged from sg a costs in retail in increased from last year primarily as a result of additional personnel and programs in which are aimed at increasing revenues in the retail segment   in severance payments to managers  and approximately  in additional sales compensation expense as a result of converting our sales force from commission based to salary based 
as stated above  we made a decision to invest in the people and programs in an effort to achieve significant growth in the retail segment and we expect these additional costs will result in higher sg a costs in as well 
consolidated items in  we recognized an impairment of  on a long term note receivable which dated back to the sale of the childs childs manufacturing plant in elberton  georgia in in the fourth quarter of  we were in a dispute with the buyer and determined this note was not collectable in its entirety and negotiated a payment of  in cash to the company and a remaining note for  which will be repaid through the purchase of product from childs childs 
in return  a supply agreement requiring us to buy all of our elberton memorials from the buyer was terminated 
expenses related to the adverse arbitral award and legal expenses were million in compared to million in the charge consists entirely of the million settlement amount paid to eurimex 
the charges in were for legal and associated expenses relating entirely to the eurimex arbitration 
foreign exchange loss in was  compared to  in resulting from the effect of the declining value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
unallocated corporate overhead increased from last year primarily as a result of expenses associated with executive searches for our memorials group as well as consulting expenses associated with the company s sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts 
interest expense increased from  to  primarily as a result of higher borrowings and higher interest rates in compared to the increased borrowings resulted from an increase in long term debt from the investment in forethought financial services and an increase in short term borrowings on our revolving credit facility primarily as a result of payment of the eurimex settlement amount 
the interest rate paid on our credit facility is tied primarily to libor  which increased throughout and we anticipate further increases in due to the restructuring of our debt facility in the second quarter of we wrote off an additional  of deferred financing charges  which also contributed to the increase 
income tax benefit  as a percentage of pre tax income  decreased to for from an expense of in our tax rate is significantly affected by the fact that we operate in both the us and canada and have historically had different tax rates in those jurisdictions 
we expect our canadian tax rate to remain approximately and our us tax rate to range from to 
it is very difficult to predict an expected blended rate for the company for  as it is heavily dependant on pre tax earnings in those jurisdictions 
the lower blended effective tax rate in was due to higher losses in the us resulting from the eurimex payment 
we had a loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of  in as a result of the sale of the autumn rose quarry 
this compares to income  net of taxes  of  in broken down as follows we had a gain on the sale of the cemetery operations of  this gain was offset by the loss from operations of the cemeteries in of  an impairment charge of  for the discontinued autumn rose quarry  and the loss from the operations of the autumn rose quarry of  we have no remaining discontinued operations held for sale as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue was down  gross profit declined and total sg a costs decreased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for the year ended december  were down from primarily as a result of lower shipments from our pennsylvania black and barre gray quarries 
these lower shipments were partially offset by increased shipments from the bethel white quarry 
our pennsylvania black quarry had decreased revenues because of low yields  which means we had lower than normal recoveries of saleable granite 
this decreased the quantity of granite available for sale 
revenues from the bethel white quarry increased as a result of a very strong export customer demand as well as good quarry yields 
gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for the year ended december  decreased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to from the primary reason for the decrease in gross profit was the decrease in revenue and higher quarrying costs resulting from low yields from our pennsylvania black quarry 
this was partially offset by the increase in revenue from our bethel white quarry 
gross profit was affected to a lesser degree by increased productivity and higher gross margins in the barre gray quarry which was offset by lower gross margins in the salisbury pink quarry as a result of decreased pricing required in an effort to decrease inventory and develop new markets for that stone 
sg a costs in our quarry segment for decreased from primarily due to lower incentive payments and a decrease in bad debt expense 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing group for the year ended december  increased over this was primarily due to increased shipments of mausoleums and estate memorials  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the national world war ii memorial being constructed in washington  dc which was completed in compared to gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group increased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased slightly for the year ended december  compared to the slight increase is consistent with the general improvement in the quality of orders in the division  including larger and more expensive memorials  mausoleums and estate memorials 
sg a costs for the manufacturing group in were up over  primarily as a result of several small increases  including an increase in the cost of employee benefits 
retail segment analysis revenues for our retail operations in were down from as our retail group experienced a very difficult year 
we believe the reasons behind the decline were a combination of a weak economy in the first quarter of  increased competition primarily from funeral homes selling memorials  and pricing policies for our retail memorials that caused us to lose sales from the lower end segment of the market 
gross profit dollars in for the retail operations decreased from as a result of decreased revenue  however gross profit as a percentage in increased to over sg a costs in retail increased just but increased as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of declining revenues and a certain portion of our sg a costs being fixed in the short term 
consolidated items unallocated corporate overhead in decreased from primarily as a result of a one time severance payment of  in expenses related to the adverse arbitral award and legal expenses were million in compared to million in the and charges consist of legal and associated expenses relating entirely to the eurimex arbitration 
foreign exchange loss in was  compared to a gain of  in resulting from changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
interest expense decreased from the combined effect of slightly lower borrowings and decreased interest rates in compared to income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income increased to for from in primarily as a result of a greater portion of our consolidated pre tax income coming from our canadian operations  which are taxed at a higher rate 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes was  in broken down as follows we had a gain on the sale of the cemetery operations of  this gain was offset by the loss from operations of the cemeteries in of  an impairment charge of  for the discontinued autumn rose quarry  and the loss from the operations of the autumn rose quarry of  in  income from discontinued operations net of taxes was  consisting primarily of the profit from cemetery operations 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we consider our liquidity to be adequate to meet our long and short term cash requirements to fund operations and pursue our growth strategy 
historically  we have met these requirements primarily from cash generated by operating activities and periodic borrowings under the commercial credit facilities described below 
there may be future acquisitions as we pursue our growth strategy that may require additional financing in excess of that available under our existing credit facility 
in january  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total of  as part of our share buy back program 
we have repurchased a total of  shares for  under the share buy back program 
there remain  shares authorized to be purchased under the current repurchase program 
we will continue to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis determined by  among other things  current debt levels  anticipated uses of capital  the price of the stock and the general market conditions 
we did not repurchase any shares in in  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan decreased by approximately million primarily as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the pension benefit obligation from to 
we have historically contributed between  and million per year to the plan and expect to make an annual contribution of  in  which  we believe  we will be able to fund either from cash from operations or borrowing under our credit facilities 
cash flow at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  cash from operations 
net cash used in operating activities was  in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in the primary reason for the change is the lower earnings in due in significant part to the million eurimex settlement payment coupled with the non cash adjustments primarily from an increase in deferred taxes related to the eurimex settlement and an increase in inventory as well as other working capital changes  which had the effect of decreasing cash from operations 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in the primary reason for the change was lower earnings in  excluding the effects of the write down of goodwill in coupled with the non cash adjustments primarily associated with the sale of the cemeteries  and other working capital changes  which had the effect of decreasing cash from operations 
cash from investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in in  our capital spending was million primarily as a result of continued investment in our quarry  retail and manufacturing operations 
in addition  we used million in cash to make investments  primarily a million investment in forethought financial services 
this cash used was partially offset by the receipt of million primarily from the payment of a note  which we had received in as partial consideration for the sale of our cemeteries 
cash used in investing activities comes from either borrowings under our credit facilities or from operations 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in in  we had higher than normal levels of capital expenditures  especially in our retail segment  as we made improvements to store facilities and constructed new facilities in order to support and enhance the brand image of our company 
these expenditures were slightly offset by the million in cash received  as of december   toward the total million due from saber management llc from the sale of the cemeteries 
in  our capital expenditures were at a lower level and were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the lawson facility 
cash from financing activities 
financing activities provided million in as a result of increased borrowings under our line of credit  an increase in borrowing under our long term note as well as cash provided from employees exercising stock options 
this was partially offset by the payment of dividends 
in  million in cash was used primarily as a result of the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock 
in  million in cash was used primarily as a result of principal payments on long term debt 
capital resources cit credit facility we have a credit facility with the cit group business credit cit that expires in october the facility consists of an acquisition term loan line of credit of up to million and a revolving credit facility of up to another million based on eligible accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
in the second quarter of  we opted to decrease our total facility from million to million and remove fleet bank as a participant 
in the fourth quarter of  we added chittenden bank as a participant in the facility and returned the facility to the original million 
there were no substantive changes to the facility as a result of the changes and we believe we have adequate borrowing capacity to implement our growth strategy 
as of december   we had million outstanding and million available under the term loan line of credit and million outstanding and million available under the revolving credit facility 
on february   the company acquired the rockwell white granite quarry for million  which was financed using the term loan  bringing the total outstanding on the term loan to approximately million and million available 
our loan agreement with cit places restrictions on our ability to  among other things  sell assets  participate in mergers  incur debt  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and make investments or guarantees 
the agreement also contains certain covenants for a minimum operating cash flow to debt service ratio and a limit on the total liabilities to net worth ratio of the company as described below 
debt service coverage ratio 
the facility requires the ratio of the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less taxes paid and capital expenditures to the sum of interest  scheduled debt repayments and dividends be at least for any trailing twelve month period at the end of a quarter 
primarily as a result of the expenses attributable to the eurimex arbitration including the million settlement amount paid in the company has been in violation of this covenant and has received waivers  which primarily allow the company to exclude those expenses from the covenant calculation 
as of december   the company was in violation of the debt service coverage ratio due to charges in the fourth quarter of related to an impaired note receivable and severance payments as well as higher than normal capital expenditures in we have received a waiver which will allow us to exclude certain of these expenditures from our calculation of ebitda and capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of allowing the company to be in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio at december  this waiver includes modifications to the debt service coverage ratio in based on the company s projections which we believe will allow us to remain in compliance with this covenant in the future 
total liabilities to net worth ratio 
the facility also requires that the ratio of the company s total liabilities to net worth not exceed as of december   the company was in compliance with this covenant as our total liabilities to net worth ratio was 
interest rates 
we have a multi tiered interest rate structure on our outstanding debt with cit 
we are currently at the lowest available rates the rates in effect as of december  were as follows amount outstanding formula effective rate revolving credit facility million prime revolving credit facility million libor term loan a million libor term loan b million libor we can elect the interest rate structure under the credit facility based on the prime rate or libor for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan 
the incremental rate above or below prime and above libor is based on our funded debt to net worth ratio and the company is currently at the most favorable increments available 
the following table shows the libor or prime rate elections libor election prime election revolving credit facility libor prime term loans libor prime canadian credit facility as of december   we also had million cdn available and outstanding under a demand revolving line of credit with the royal bank of canada 
contractual obligations payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total obligations long term debt consists of various notes payable see note of the consolidated financial statements for general business use and strategic acquisitions and estimated interest thereon  which will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our existing credit facilities 
obligations of million under our revolving credit facility at december  are not included in this table 
operating leases are principally for real estate and vehicles see note of the consolidated financial statements and will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our existing credit facilities 
the purchase obligation is a supply agreement with adams granite co 
the company has agreed to purchase a minimum of  of monuments from adams granite each year for a term of seven years with various stipulations as to variations from the minimum order and pricing agreements see note of the consolidated financial statements  and will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our existing credit facilities 
the agreement was entered into on january  and the remaining term is four years 
in addition to the contractual obligations included in the table  we have obligations to fund pension plans 
the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time 
therefore  these obligations are not included in the table 
capital expenditures our primary need for capital will be to maintain and improve our manufacturing  quarrying  and retail facilities and to finance acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we have approximately million budgeted for capital expenditures in  not including potential acquisitions 
we believe the combination of cash flow from operations and our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
seasonality historically  our operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally  our net sales have been highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern areas generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set 
in addition  we typically close certain of our vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to adverse weather conditions 
as a result  we have historically incurred a net loss during the first three months of each calendar year 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of  beginning on january  we are currently evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
amends opinion to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas risk factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our continued growth depends  at least in part  on our ability to form relationships with funeral directors  cemeteries and other death care providers 
our ability to continue to grow our retail business depends in part on our ability to develop referral relationships with funeral homes  cemeteries and other death care professionals 
we cannot assure you we will be able to successfully form these relationships in all of the areas in which we have retail businesses 
in certain areas  we may be unable to form such relationships where our stores are in direct competition with funeral homes and cemeteries that sell granite memorials 
our continued growth depends  at least in part  on acquisitions  which involve numerous risks that could negatively affect our earnings and financial condition 
our ability to continue to grow depends in part upon the acquisition of additional companies 
we cannot assure you we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  or we will be able to consummate transactions on acceptable terms 
further  even if we successfully acquire additional companies  we cannot assure you we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of such companies with our own 
we intend to finance acquisitions through a combination of available cash resources  bank borrowings  and  in appropriate circumstances  the issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional companies will have a significant effect on our financial position  and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
also  acquisitions may result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on the company s financial statements  the write off of which would reduce reported earnings at the point in time the goodwill is deemed impaired 
with respect to retail acquisitions  and as a result of our definition of reporting units under sfas  goodwill impairment could be incurred at our normal annual impairment review or in some cases at the closing of the acquisition 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with existing independent retailers  or add additional independent retailers  our sales may not continue to grow and could decline 
we have historically sold our granite memorials to consumers through independent retailers 
since we entered the retail business  we have acquired retailers with multiple retail outlets and have opened new stores in states 
however  we are still dependent in part on our independent retailers for the successful distribution of our products to the ultimate customer 
we have no control over the independent retailers operations  including such matters as retail price  advertising and marketing 
three important components of our growth strategy are to continue to acquire retailers  open new retail stores in selected markets and pursue strategic alliances with funeral homes  cemetery owners  and other death care professionals 
although we have taken steps to reduce conflicts between our owned retail stores and our independent retailers  the implementation of these elements of our strategy has in the past been  and may in the future be  construed by some of our existing independent retailers as an effort to compete with them 
in certain cases  this has adversely affected their relationship with us and caused them to decrease or cease their purchases of our products 
these issues may continue to arise as we pursue our growth strategy 
in addition  significant barriers to entry created by local heritage  community presence and tradition characterize the granite memorial retail industry 
consequently  we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty replacing and adding retailers or entering particular retail markets in the event of a loss of an independent retailer 
we cannot assure you we will be able to maintain our existing relationships or establish new relationships with independent retailers 
disruption in our relationships with independent retailers could impede our sales growth or cause sales to decline  which would adversely affect our business and financial results 
opening new stores is a component of our growth strategy and entails uncertainties and risks that could adversely affect our profitability 
our ability to continue to grow our retail business will depend in part upon our ability to open new retail stores in selected locations 
our success in opening new retail stores will depend on our ability to identify suitable locations for opening new retail stores on acceptable terms  our ability to attract and retain competent management and sales personnel  and our ability to form strategic alliances and relationships with local funeral homes  cemeteries and other death care professionals  and our ability to attract customers to our new stores 
it is unlikely new retail stores we open will generate significant profits in the early stages  and many new stores will lose money for the first few years of operation 
accordingly  opening new retail stores may adversely affect our business or profitability 
if we lose our key personnel  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our operations and the implementation of our operating and growth strategies  such as integration of acquisitions and the opening of new retail stores  are management intensive 
we are substantially dependent upon the abilities and continued efforts of kurt m 
swenson  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other senior management 
our business is also dependent on our ability to continue to attract and retain a highly skilled retail  quarrying and manufacturing workforce  including sales managers and counselors  stone cutters  sand blasters  sculptors and other skilled artisans 
the loss of the services of mr 
swenson  other members of the company s senior management or other highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we face intense competition and  if we are unable to compete successfully  we may be unable to increase our sales  which would adversely affect our business and profitability 
the dimension stone industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other dimension stone quarriers  including quarriers of granite  marble  limestone  travertine and other natural stones 
we also compete with manufacturers of so called engineered stone as well as manufacturers of other building materials like concrete  aluminum  glass  wood and other materials 
we compete with providers of these materials on the basis of price  availability of supply  end user preference for certain colors  patterns or textures  and other factors 
the granite memorial industry is also highly competitive 
we compete with other granite quarriers and manufacturers in the sale of granite blocks for memorial use on the basis of price  color  quality  geographic proximity  service  design availability  production capability  availability of supply and delivery options 
all of our colors of granite are subject to competition from memorial grade granite blocks of similar color supplied by quarriers located throughout the world 
there are approximately manufacturers of granite memorials in north america 
there are also manufacturers of granite memorials in india  south africa  china and portugal that sell finished memorials in north america 
our quarrying and manufacturing competitors include both domestic and international companies  some of which may have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources 
foreign competitors may have access to lower cost labor and better commercial deposits of memorial grade granite  and may be subject to less restrictive regulatory requirements 
for example  companies in south africa  india  china and portugal also manufacture and export finished granite memorials into north america which compete with our products 
the competition for retail sales of granite memorials faced by our retail outlets is also intense and is based on price  quality  service  design availability and breadth of product line 
competitors include funeral home and cemetery owners  including consolidators  which have greater financial resources than we do  as well as approximately  independent retailers of granite memorials located outside of cemeteries and funeral homes 
we cannot assure you domestic or foreign competition will not adversely impact our business 
the increasing trend toward cremation  and potential declines in memorialization for other reasons  may result in decreased sales of our products 
there is an increasing trend toward cremation in the united states 
according to the cremation association of north america  or cana  cremation was used in approximately of the deaths in the united states in  compared to approximately in  and cana expects this rate to rise to approximately by while we continue to believe that many families will choose to permanently memorialize their loved ones  regardless of whether they choose cremation over a traditional burial  to the extent increases in cremation rates result in decreases in memorialization rates  this decrease will result in a decline in our memorial sales  which will adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is also subject to the risk that memorialization rates may decline over time for other reasons 
certain cemeteries have in the past and may in the future limit the use of granite memorials as a memorialization option 
to the extent general memorialization rates or the willingness of cemeteries to accept granite memorials declines  this decline could adversely affect our business 
sales of our products are seasonal and may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
historically  our operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally  our net sales are highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern regions generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set 
we typically close certain of our vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to weather conditions 
we have historically incurred an aggregate net loss during the first three months of each calendar year 
our operating results may vary materially from quarter to quarter due to  among other things  acquisitions  changes in product mix  shipping conditions and limitations on the timing of price increases  making quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful 
our competitive position could be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe our tradenames  trademarks  brands  designs and other intellectual property are of great value  and we rely on trademark  copyright and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to this valuable intellectual property 
third parties may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property 
in addition  our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights 
we may need to resort to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights  most notably the rock of ages trademark  could adversely affect our business and competitive position 
our business is subject to a number of operating risks that are difficult to predict and manage 
our quarry and manufacturing operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent in those industries  including among others  unanticipated surface or underground conditions  varying saleable granite recovery rates due to natural cracks and other imperfections in granite quarries  equipment failures  accidents and worker injuries  labor issues  weather conditions and events  unanticipated transportation costs and price fluctuations 
as a result  actual costs and expenditures  production quantities and delivery dates  as well as revenues  may differ materially from those anticipated  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our international operations may expose us to a number of risks related to conducting business in foreign countries 
we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal from sales to customers outside the united states  with approximately of revenues in fiscal from sales in canada by the company s canadian subsidiary 
foreign sales are subject to numerous risks  including currency conversion risks  limitations including taxes on the reparation of earnings  slower and more difficult accounts receivable collection and greater complication and expense in complying with foreign laws 
sales of our ancillary products are cyclical  which may adversely affect our operating results 
the markets for our industrial precision products  which include machine base and surface plates that are utilized in the automotive  aeronautic  computer  machine tool  optical  precision grinding and inspection industries  and granite press rolls used in the manufacture of paper  are subject to substantial cyclical variations 
sales of these products are subject to decline as a result of general economic downturns  or as a result of uncertainties regarding current and future economic conditions that generally affect such industries 
we cannot assure you changes in the industries to which we sell our precision products will not adversely affect our operating results 
our credit facility with cit includes covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations and financial tests that we must meet in order to continue to borrow under the facility 
the terms of our credit facility with cit restrict our ability to  among other things  consummate asset sales  participate in mergers  incur additional debt  pay dividends  repurchase stock or make investments or guarantees 
the terms also contain covenants that require us to meet financial tests  including a minimum operating cash flow to debt service ratio and a maximum total liabilities to net worth ratio  in order to continue to borrow under the facility and avoid a default that might lead to an early termination of the facility 
the terms of this credit facility  including these covenants  are generally described above in this item under the caption liquidity and capital resources capital resources cit credit facility 
as described under such caption  we have been and were as of december   in violation of the minimum operating cash flow to debt service coverage ratio  but were granted a waiver allowing us to exclude certain expenditures from our calculation of ebitda and capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of and thereby comply with this covenant at december  also as described under such caption  the waiver includes modifications to the minimum operating cash flow to debt service coverage ratio in based on our projections 
however  our actual results may vary from these projections and  accordingly  we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain compliance with this or other covenants in our loan facility or that we will continue to receive waivers of any non compliance 
if we are unable to comply with the financial or other covenants of our loan facility and do not receive waivers of our non compliance  we may unable to borrow additional amounts under the facility and outstanding amounts under the facility could be accelerated and become due and payable immediately  which would adversely affect or liquidity and our business and operations 
existing stockholders are able to exercise significant control over us 
kurt m 
swenson and his brother  kevin c 
swenson  collectively have of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock  and will therefore be in a position to control the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of transactions involving a change in control of the company 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations 
our quarry and manufacturing operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal and state governmental statutes and agencies  including the federal occupational safety and health act  the mine safety and health administration and similar state and canadian authorities 
our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations administered by the united states environmental protection agency and similar state and canadian authorities  for the protection of the environment  including but not limited to those relating to air and water quality  and solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal 
these laws and regulations may require parties to fund remedial action or to pay damages regardless of fault 
environmental laws and regulations may also impose liability with respect to divested or terminated operations even if the operations were divested or terminated many years ago 
in addition  current and future environmental or occupational health and safety laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations may require significant expenditures for compliance  which could require us to modify or curtail our operations 
we cannot predict the effect of such laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any material noncompliance with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
no call legislation may adversely affect our retail marketing efforts 
our retail stores and sales counselors are subject to the so called no call laws  which allow consumers to place their telephone number on a no call list maintained by various states and the federal government 
at present  there are no call laws in a majority of states in which we do business and the federal no call law went into effect in the fall of counselors are unable to make telephone calls to any consumer whose number has been placed on the applicable no call list  subject to certain limited exceptions 
making telephone calls to introduce the company and set appointments has been an important part of marketing our retail products and services 
while we are taking steps to decrease our reliance on telephone marketing calls  compliance with the no call laws could adversely affect our retail business and results of operations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm are unable to affirm the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in future years  the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 
our internal controls may not be adequate 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we assess and report on our internal control over financial reporting  beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ending december  in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must audit and report on  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we are in the process of documenting and testing our system of internal controls to provide the basis for our report 
however  at this time  due to the ongoing evaluation and testing  no assurance can be given that there may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that would be required to be reported 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to report that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective 
in this event  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the market value of our class a common stock 
employees strikes and other labor related disruptions may adversely affect our operations 
our business is labor intensive  and our workforce includes  among other employees  highly skilled quarrying and manufacturing personnel such as stone cutters  sand blasters  sculptors and other skilled artisans 
approximately of our workforce is unionized 
strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
our collective bargaining agreements with the granite cutters association and the united steelworkers of america  respectively  which together represent approximately employees in our vermont manufacturing and quarrying operations expire on april  if we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreement  or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized  we could be subject to work interruptions or stoppages which could adversely affect our operations and our business 
provisions of our corporate organizational documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of the company  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by laws grant ten votes per share to each share of class b common stock  divide the board of directors into three classes  each of which will have a different three year term  provide the stockholders may remove directors from office only for cause and by a supermajority vote  provide special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the board of directors or certain company officers and not by stockholders  establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for stockholder proposals to be considered at annual stockholders meetings  authorize the issuance of preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of  or be dilutive to  the holders of our common stock 
certain of these provisions may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or unsolicited acquisition proposals a stockholder may consider favorable 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit or delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk rock of ages has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally debt obligations under its credit facilities 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
based on our current variable rate debt obligations  we believe our exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
based on the december  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  of million  the impact of a increase in the interest rates would be approximately  a year 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from the operations of our canadian subsidiary 
based on the size of this subsidiary and our corresponding exposure to changes in the canadian us dollar exchange rate  we do not consider our market exposure relating to currency exchange to be material
