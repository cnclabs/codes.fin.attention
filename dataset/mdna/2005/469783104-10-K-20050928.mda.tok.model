item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview jaco is a leading distributor of active and passive electronic components to industrial oems that are used in the manufacture and assembly of electronic products in such industries as telecommunications  medical devices  computers and office equipment  military aerospace  and automotive and consumer electronics 
products distributed by the company include semiconductors  flat panel displays  capacitors  resistors  electromechanical devices and power supplies 
the electronics industry experienced a severe downturn beginning in  which continued through most of the decline was attributable to increased manufacturing capacity combined with a significant decrease in demand for electronic components 
the second half of saw an improvement in the demand for electronic components throughout the entire industry 
while demand for our products has remained relatively stable in recent periods  the average selling prices of many of the components we distribute  particularly semiconductor and passive components  have decreased due to global competitive pressures  which has adversely affected our operating profits 
in response  the company has implemented cost reduction initiatives to reduce expenses as required to support current sales and profit levels 
due to the ongoing shift of manufacturing to the far east  the company has modified its business model to pursue the business available in the united states  increase its support of global contract manufacturers that require its value added services and logistics programs  and aggressively promote its flat panel display fpd product offerings  which it believes have promising potential for future growth 
net loss increased in fiscal to million  compared with a net loss of million during fiscal fiscal results were impacted by an inventory write down of million million net of taxes 
the company determined that due to changes in market conditions in the united states  certain products  in most cases  originally for specific customers  were no longer salable 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  we believe that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
the accounting principles we utilized in preparing our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows valuation of receivables the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors payments from customers and a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts is maintained based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues  which have been identified 
while such uncollectible amounts have historically been within the company s expectations and provisions established  if a customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally mitigated due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base  their dispersion across geographic areas and industries  along with the company s policy of maintaining credit insurance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out and average cost methods 
the company s inventories are comprised of high technology components sold to rapidly changing and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors rendering inventories as unsellable at normal gross profit margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate market value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protections and stock rotations 
due to the large number of transactions and complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding the valuation of inventory at market value 
in addition  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual results may be different than those estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily represent franchise agreements and non compete covenants 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results as the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant industry or economic trends 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and goodwill could occur 
valuation of deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we would record a valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the amount of future tax benefit would not be realized 
currently  we have not recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  there is no assurance that a valuation allowance will not be needed in the future to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
the recording of a valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
 which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r will require the company to expense sbp awards with compensation cost for sbp transactions measured at fair value 
the fasb originally stated a preference for a lattice model because it believed that a lattice model more fully captures the unique characteristics of employee stock options in the estimate of fair value  as compared to the black scholes model which the company currently uses for its footnote disclosure 
the fasb decided to remove its explicit preference for a lattice model and not require a single valuation methodology 
sfas no 
r requires the company to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company has not yet determined the impact of applying the various provisions of sfas no 
r will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
sfas no 
amends opinion to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal periods after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

opinion previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss interest expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal results from continuing operations net sales for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
we have seen demand for our products remain stable for the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
the average selling price of many of our components has decreased over compared to our previous fiscal year and where practical  customers continue to outsource their manufacturing requirements to the far east 
these factors were the primary reason for the decrease in our net sales 
as a result  we have adapted our marketing strategy in the united states to support the business that we see remaining in the united states  and have made changes to better serve our existing customer base 
recent initiatives include expanding our quote group to enable us to be more responsive to the mid level contract manufacturers and changing our marketing efforts to focus on those core lines  including fpds  where we believe we can increase our net sales 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we opened in our hauppauge  new york facility an in house fpd integration center that enables us to expand our value added capabilities to our customers 
we believe it is important for distributors of electronic components to focus on the value added services that our customers require 
our ability to grow sales will be partially dependent on our ability to increase fpd sales and including the integration center  we have made extensive efforts to increase this business going forward 
fpd product represented of our net sales during fiscal as compared to in fiscal we continue to market semiconductors aggressively 
semiconductor sales represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal although our business focus is primarily on the us market  we maintain a sales presence in the far east targeted at the global contract manufacturing customers to which we primarily sell semiconductors through our logistics programs  which consist of inventory management and warehousing capabilities 
passive components  which are standard commodity items such as capacitors and resistors  represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal due to the increase in capacity worldwide  we saw pricing in passive components decrease by over 
electromechanical products  such as power supplies  relays and printer heads  represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we believe this is a product line with higher selling prices that still has a viable market in the united states 
primarily through our logistics programs with global contract manufacturers  our export sales represented approximately of our net sales for fiscal as compared to in fiscal most of these sales derived from business that we were able to maintain as it transitioned from the united states to the far east 
we intend to expand our business with these customers based on our successful existing relationships with them 
in addition  we are continuing to search for a strategic alliance or partner in the far east to potentially allow us to expand more rapidly in this growing market 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand for product 
during the fourth quarter  we took a write down of approximately million for obsolete inventory based on our determination that  due to changes in market conditions in the united states  certain of our products primarily intended for distribution to specific customers were no longer saleable 
without this write down  our gross profit margin for fiscal would have been 
as discussed above the company conducts large amounts of business through its logistics programs in support of global contract manufacturers  which constitute lower end  value added services that tend to be at lower margins than the rest of our business 
if the current mix of our sales continues  we do not anticipate any material change in our margin for the foreseeable future 
in addition  demand and pricing for our products have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industry wide trends and other events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  representing a reduction of million  or 
management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
we continue to reduce our costs by targeting our marketing expenditures on our core business areas while paring back elsewhere 
this approach has allowed us to lower sg a while maintaining the necessary infrastructure to support our customers 
we have been able to reduce personnel and eliminate non essential fixed costs by among other measures  achieving rent reductions  and due to the decrease in gross profit dollars  our sale commissions have decreased 
as of june  certain cost saving measures were still being implemented 
the company believes sg a will continue to decrease during the fiscal year ending june  interest expense increased million for fiscal to million  compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher borrowing levels to maintain adequate inventory  primarily to support a specific customer  and higher borrowing rates 
because we support our operations in part through bank borrowings  any significant increase in our borrowing rates could significantly increase our interest expense  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share full diluted for fiscal as discussed above our net loss from operations was impacted in part by our inventory write down of approximately million  net of taxes  or per diluted share 
our net loss from continuing operations compared to last year is attributable to the decrease in our net sales and reduction in gross profit margin due to changes in the mix of our products sold and inventory write down 
discontinued operations on september   the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its contract manufacturing subsidiary  nexus custom electronics  inc nexus  to sagamore holdings  inc 
for consideration of up to  subject to closing adjustments  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the divestiture of nexus allows the company to focus its resources on its core electronics distribution business 
under the terms of the purchase agreement relating to this transaction  the company received  of the purchase consideration in cash on the closing date 
such cash consideration was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the balance of the fixed portion of the purchase consideration was satisfied through the delivery of a  subordinated note issued by the purchaser 
this note has a maturity date of september  and bears interest at the lower of the prime rate or 
the note is payable by the purchaser in quarterly cash installments ranging from  to  commencing september and continuing for each quarter thereafter until maturity 
prepayment of the principal of and accrued interest on the note is permitted 
additionally  the company is entitled to receive additional consideration in the form of a six year earn out based on of the annual net sales of nexus after the closing date  up to  in the aggregate 
net earnings from these discontinued operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal year the decrease in our net earnings from discontinued operations compared to last year was primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales and gross profit from discontinued operations  which was partially offset by the gain on the sale of nexus 
combined net loss the combined net loss from both our continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal the increase in our combined net loss compared to last year is primarily attributable to the reduction in our net sales and gross profit margins  as described above 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal results from continuing operations net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of from million for fiscal approximately million of the increase in net sales is attributable to new supplier relationships associated with the acquisition of certain assets of the electronics distribution business of reptron electronics  inc reptron in june and the balance is attributed to internal growth 
we have seen an improvement in the demand for components throughout the electronics industry 
fpds continue to represent our fastest growing product group 
fpd sales increased from of our total net sales during fiscal to nearly for fiscal our ability to sustain our sales growth will be partially determined by our ability to continue to market successfully our flat panel displays 
semiconductors continue to represent our largest product group in terms of net sales 
during fiscal  semiconductors accounted for of our total net sales 
our semiconductor sales grew during the fiscal year as a result of increased marketing efforts  improving market conditions  and the addition of certain strategic franchises that we added through our acquisition of reptron 
passive components have become very competitive in pricing 
with manufacturing being done almost entirely off shore  it has become difficult to pursue new opportunities 
although we continue to still have a strong presence in selling passive components  our passive component sales decreased to of net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal we have also increased our marketing of power supplies and printerheads 
these products have a higher selling price per component  usually require some design work to be performed and as a result often generate higher gross profit margins 
our sales to the far east represented approximately of our total net sales in fiscal these sales were primarily derived from business that we were already doing domestically that we were able to transition to the far east 
it is important to our ability to increase sales that we are able to expand our presence in the far east  which represents the fastest growth area globally in our industry due to its currently low cost structure 
gross profit was million  or of net sales for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal  an increase of 
management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand for product 
as discussed above  our passive component sales are decreasing 
historically  we have realized higher gross profit margins on passive components than semiconductors 
as a result  unless demand for passive components increase  we do not anticipate any material increase in our overall margins  and we do not anticipate any significant change in demand for the foreseeable future 
in addition  demand for our products may be adversely affected by events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal the acquisition of reptron increased our sg a by million 
we continue to monitor all discretionary spending  without reducing personnel to the point that we cannot support sales growth 
our variable costs are primarily those costs associated with increases in gross profit dollars  such as sales commissions and bonuses 
management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
we believe that we already have in place the infrastructure to sustain our sales growth for the foreseeable future 
therefore  an increase in our net sales should result in a decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase is attributable to higher borrowing as a result of cash expended due to the acquisition of reptron and cash required due to the higher accounts receivable and inventory as a result of the growth in sales 
slightly higher interest rates also contributed to the increase 
any significant increase in our borrowing rates could significantly increase our interest expense  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the improved performance is attributable to the increase in our net sales and resulting increase in gross profit dollars  partially offset by the increase in sg a and interest expense 
we believe we have benefited during fiscal from the improved demand in the electronics industry and the integration of the reptron distribution business 
discontinued operations as described in item business discontinued operations  on september   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our contract manufacturing subsidiary  nexus  for total consideration of up to million  consisting primarily of million paid in cash at closing and a million subordinated note from the purchaser payable in quarterly installments over the next five years 
net income from these discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share  for fiscal for fiscal  there was a net loss from these discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
increase in sales resulted in improved utilization of our fixed costs  resulting in increased gross profit 
combined net loss the net loss from both continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the improved performance was attributable to the increase in gross profit dollars in excess of the increased sg a during fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources to provide additional liquidity and flexibility in funding its operations  the company borrows amounts under credit facilities and other external sources of financing 
on december   the company entered into a third restated and amended loan and security agreement with gmac commercial finance llc and pnc bank  national association providing for a  revolving secured line of credit 
this credit facility has a maturity date of december  borrowings under the credit facility are based principally on eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company  as defined in the credit agreement  and are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at june   the outstanding balance on this revolving line of credit facility was million  with an additional million available 
the company has outstanding a million stand by letter of credit on behalf of a certain vendor 
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings at june  was approximately 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  including  among others  provisions for maintenance of specified levels of ebitda and minimum net worth  and restricts the company s ability to pay dividends the credit agreement also includes a subjective acceleration clause and requires the deposit of customer receipts to be directed to a blocked account and applied directly to the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
accordingly  this debt is classified as a current liability 
at june   the company was not in compliance with certain bank covenants  including minimum editda and minimum net worth 
on september   the company s credit facility was amended to waive its non compliance with certain bank covenants  including minimum ebitda and minimum net worth  for the quarter ended june  the company s credit facility was also amended to restate the existing covenants and to add additional covenants  including  among other things  to i reduce the maximum loan amount from  to  ii modify the availability formula  iii reset existing covenants for fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum net worth and capital expenditures as defined in the agreement  and iv define and add a new covenant regarding operating cash flow 
as a result of the modification of the availability formula  the company would still have an additional million available for future borrowing as of june  failure to remain in compliance with the company s bank covenants could trigger an acceleration of the company s obligation to repay all outstanding borrowings under its credit facility and or limit the company s ability to borrow additional amounts under the line of credit 
this would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
on may   the company s credit facility was amended to waive our compliance with certain bank covenants  including minimum ebitda and minimum net worth  for the quarter ended march  on february   the company s credit facility was amended to retroactively restate the existing covenants and to add additional covenants  including  among other things  to i modify the availability formula  ii require the company to maintain un drawn availability of not less than  at all times  iii define and reset existing covenants for minimum ebitda  fixed charge coverage ratio  capital expenditures and minimum net worth  iv add a new covenant regarding minimum sales  v establish additional reporting requirements  vi modify interest provisions  and vii permit certain of the company s domestic and foreign receivables to qualify as eligible receivables for a period of time 
on november   the company s credit facility was amended to exclude  effective as of october   any extraordinary gains  including any gains derived from the sale of assets of nexus  from the calculation of ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants 
on september   the company s credit facility was amended to provide the lenders consent to the company s sale of it s contract manufacturing subsidiary  nexus  and to i change it s ebitda  fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum net worth covenants  ii eliminate the remaining portion of the additional  of the additional available amount under the facility to zero  iii require the cash proceeds from the sale of nexus to be used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the facility  and iv and add a requirement that the company maintain an aggregate un drawn availability of million until certain financial requirements are achieved  which would reduce the un drawn availability requirement to  at june   we had cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  as compared to cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  at june  as described above  our credit agreement requires our cash generated from operations to be applied directly to the prepayment of indebtedness under our credit facility 
our working capital at june  included approximately  from discontinued operations 
for fiscal  our net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  as compared to million for fiscal the increase in net cash used is primarily attributable to an increase in our loss from continuing operations and a decrease in our accounts payable 
the increase in net cash used was partially offset by an million cash in advance payment from a specific customer during the third quarter of fiscal as part of a bill and hold arrangement in which the related inventory has not yet been shipped and the revenue has not been recognized 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for fiscal as compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to million in proceeds we received from our sale of substantially all of the assets of nexus in september net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for fiscal as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal the increase in net cash used is primarily attributable to a decrease in net borrowings under our credit facility of approximately million 
for fiscal and fiscal  our inventory turnover was times and times  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at june  was days compared to days at june  inventory turnover and average days outstanding are key ratios that management relies on to monitor our business 
in february  we completed certain leasehold improvements to construct an fpd facility that now allows us to vertically integrate our entire fpd operation 
the completed facility offers customers a one stop source for their fpd supply and integration needs 
the cost of this project was approximately based upon our present plans  including no anticipated material capital expenditures  we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue while continuing to control costs 
our cash expenditures may vary significantly from current levels based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  future acquisitions and capital expenditures  if any 
historically  we have  when necessary  been able to obtain amendments to our credit facilities to satisfy instances of non compliance with financial covenants 
while we cannot assure you that any such future amendments  if needed  will be available  management believes we will be able to continue to obtain financing on acceptable terms under our existing credit facility or through other external sources 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purpose entities 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  total years long term debt   capital lease    operating lease      total      inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  which bears interest at a variable rate dependent upon either the prime rate  federal funds rate or the libor rate rates 
at august   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in any of the rates during the current fiscal year will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
each fluctuation in the rate will increase or decrease our interest expense under the credit facility by approximately million based on outstanding borrowings at august  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on other floating rate debt is not material
