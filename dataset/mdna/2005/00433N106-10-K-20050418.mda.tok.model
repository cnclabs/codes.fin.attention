part i item description of business precis  inc precis  we or the company primarily offers memberships in programs that offer savings on a wide range of healthcare services 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from our healthcare membership savings programs  which is our primary business segment 
see note segmented information in the financial statements included herein 
for the year ended december   of our consolidated revenue was from our healthcare membership savings programs 
the remaining is derived primarily from providing full third party administration services to adjudicate and pay medical claims for employers who have self funded at least a portion of their healthcare costs 
our programs offer savings on healthcare services to persons who are un insured  under insured  or who have elected to purchase only high deductible or limited benefit medical insurance policies  by providing access to the same preferred provider organizations ppos that are utilized by many insurance companies and employers who self fund at least a portion of their employees healthcare risk 
these programs are sold primarily through a network marketing strategy under the name care entr e  but are also offered through resellers who have privately labeled or co branded the care entr e services and through employers as part of an employee benefit plan 
we design these programs to benefit healthcare providers as well as our program members 
providers commonly give reduced or preferred rates to ppo networks in exchange for steerage of patients 
however  the providers must still file claim forms and wait to days to be paid for their services 
our programs utilize these same provider networks to obtain the same savings for the care entr e program members 
however  the healthcare providers are paid much more promptly and without the oversight of the typical claims review processes of an insurance company 
we provide transaction facilitation services to both the program member and the healthcare provider 
we also offer full third party administration services through our wholly owned subsidiary  access healthsource  inc  access 
access helps us offer a more complete suite of healthcare services 
we are now able to provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical escrow accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
we acquired access in the second quarter of and its results of operations have contributed favorably to our consolidated results 
access has successfully secured multi year contracts on favorable terms with its two largest clients and has brought us a stable source of revenue 
moreover  we have realized certain intangible benefits from the acquisition 
for instance  we have broadened the management responsibilities of several members of access management team to company wide roles 
our new chief operating officer  frank apodaca  is the president and ceo of access and he will be implementing  on a company wide basis  operational controls that have been successful at access 
was a difficult year for the company 
the combination of decreasing revenues resulting from a more complex escrow based healthcare savings product  a frustrated independent marketing sales force  and increased expenses from  among other things  new compensatory sales initiatives produced an operating loss 
we discuss these results in detail throughout this report 
in the first quarter of  we have undertaken measures and initiatives to improve our operating performance 
these measures and initiatives include i the integration of access management members with our management team  as mentioned above  ii the termination of certain equipment capital leases  iii other cost reduction actions  and iv exploration of additional products to compliment our core healthcare savings product and offer additional compensatory incentives to our independent marketing representatives 
industry overviews consumer healthcare industry 
the healthcare industry remains in a state of turmoil and crisis 
it is estimated that of all americans  or million individuals  were without health insurance coverage in  up from in  an increase of million people 

source us census bureau statistics published by the us department of commerce 
the percentage of people working full time without health insurance in was  an increase from in 
source us census bureau statistics published by us department of commerce 
nationally  healthcare expenditures topped trillion in  up from trillion since  
source centers for medicare and medicaid services 
at the workplace  the trends are equally problematic 
between and  monthly premiums for employer sponsored health insurance rose  the fourth consecutive year of double digit premium increases 
the increases are hitting small employers under workers particularly hard 
these small firms are more likely to have experienced an increase in premiums greater than 
these costs are not only being felt by the employer  but also by the employees 
the average monthly worker contribution for single and family healthcare coverage rose from and  respectively  in to and in all told  the average monthly premiums for single and family coverage including worker and employer share of premium are and respectively 
the cost of family coverage is now nearly  per year 
not surprisingly  employers are looking for alternatives 
in  of employers reported that they shopped for a different healthcare arrangement 

source employer health benefits summary of findings  published by the kaiser family foundation 
over utilization of the healthcare system is one of the factors behind these trends 
american citizens are utilizing healthcare services at an ever increasing rate 
behind this phenomenon is the fact that insurance plans and healthcare management organizations are structured to encourage usage 
small co payments  generally from or per office visit  encourage insured consumers to use the healthcare system more frequently because they do not perceive themselves ultimately as having to pay the full costs of the medical services received 
a number of insurers have pulled out of certain states  due to state regulations that no longer provide for a viable operating environment for many insurance companies 
as a result of these health coverage cancellations  those formerly insured individuals and families are required to pay more for their insurance coverage  cannot obtain any coverage because of pre existing conditions  or simply remain uninsured for healthcare 
corporate america has been hit hard by escalating insurance costs and many companies are reacting by shifting the cost of insurance coverage to employees or cutting benefits 
fifty two percent of large companies or more workers report they are very or somewhat likely to increase their employee s share of the costs of healthcare in 
source employer health benefits summary of findings  published by the kaiser family foundation 
this creates a dilemma for the employer  it being difficult to attract and hire quality personnel without providing health benefits at a reasonable cost to the employee  while the cost of providing employee healthcare benefits may be prohibitive or unaffordable 
tensions between medical providers and the payors are also escalating 
the medical decision is often no longer in the hands of the doctor and the patient 
rather  administrators at healthcare management organizations and insurance companies determine the procedures to be performed 
doctors and hospitals  having experienced decreases in their income and profits  are demanding higher compensation  particularly from the healthcare management organizations 
as a result  more americans are being forced to self insure and pay a growing portion of the cost of their healthcare 
some are entirely uninsured 
others can only afford or choose only a high deductible or limited benefit health insurance policy 
in either case  this patient population increasingly forgoes medical procedures or relies on emergency care for its healthcare needs and often incurs prohibitive expenses 
additionally  costs of healthcare in doctors offices and hospitals for this patient population are often far higher than the amount an insured and the insurance company would pay for the same healthcare services for its insureds 
the uninsured and underinsured patients have had no one to negotiate healthcare service costs on their behalf 
additionally  the bush administration has recently proposed federal legislation which would allow individuals who establish health savings accounts hsas to deduct from their income taxes the premiums they pay for their high deductible polices  thus reducing the net cost of those policies 
individuals who set up hsas can save substantial sums on their health insurance and their taxes 
moreover  hsas are expected to give americans more control over their health care spending 
president bush has also proposed giving low income families a  contribution made directly to their hsa  along with a  refundable tax credit to help purchase healthcare insurance covering major medical expenses 
our consumer healthcare savings solution care entr e our consumer healthcare savings membership programs are offered under the trade name of care entr e and are designed in response to rising healthcare costs and the growing number of people that can no longer afford insurance coverage 
our healthcare savings programs are based upon and emphasize the following factors responsibility for the use of healthcare must be put back in the hands of the patient 
insurance policies with low co pays and deductibles have become very popular  however  these arrangements actually encourage the over utilization that increases the costs of healthcare  the healthcare decision must be put back in the hands of the doctor and the patient  without undue oversight by parties with only economic interests in the decision  and healthcare must be affordable for the patient  while providing the medical providers with adequate payment on a timely basis for services provided 
for years  insurance companies have been reaping the benefits of managed care by obtaining healthcare for their insureds at much lower prices than that obtainable by the self insured person 
these benefits were provided through the use of preferred provider organizations ppos  where steerage of patients was promised in exchange for lower rates 
we have contracted with some of these same ppos to provide healthcare savings to our program members 
the elements discussed below are critical to the operation  further development  and offering of our managed healthcare programs 
a medical provider network that provides an effective and efficient means to deliver healthcare savings to the patient who is at least partially self insured 
we have accomplished this through arrangements with reputable  high quality preferred provider organizations 
our medical ppo network gives our members access to over  providers and  facilities throughout the us a computer system that can handle all the complexities of healthcare billing and fee schedules with speed and accuracy  enabling efficient re pricing of medical bills  which is essential in our interaction with doctors offices 
accordingly  we have developed in house systems for immediate eligibility verification and re pricing of medical bills independently as well as with the electronic repricing systems of our medical ppo network 
a staff with managed care backgrounds that interacts with the healthcare providers 
managed healthcare is an art 
not everyone has the background to interact professionally and courteously with the thousands of people representing the providers in the network 
our staff is adequately trained to provide customer support and member steerage so that our members can achieve additional medical savings by obtaining the best rates even within the same medical provider network 
the backgrounds of our staff include managing of claims offices  insurance sales  managing of physicians and physicians groups  hospital management  captive physician management  self funding of healthcare  healthcare finance  sales and management of managed care software  and management of physician front offices 
a commitment to hands on customer service for both the patient member and the healthcare provider 
most physicians and hospitals are in multiple preferred provider organization networks and do not know the negotiated rates at the time and point of healthcare service 
we believe it is important that our services allow these providers to contact us at the time and point of service for this information so that they can immediately arrange for the collection of amounts due for the services provided  and credibility with providers who expect prompt payment in exchange for access to reduced rates 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented escrow account requirements in response to the market changes in the healthcare savings industry 
members of our care entr e program are now required to establish and maintain escrow accounts to access and provide payment for hospital and physician healthcare services 
we are then able to pre certify the members ability to pay based upon the available escrow account balances and to process the members payments directly to the medical providers 
this helps us assure that the payment to the provider is made promptly and efficiently 
foresight  inc  a licensed third party administrator tpa  administers the accounts 
effective october   these escrow accounts were made mandatory for access to all medical doctors and hospitals 
by december   our cash in trust  which represents the aggregate amount that our members have on deposit in their escrow accounts was million 
our private label partners are not required to offer these accounts to their members 
the combination of these elements has allowed us to become the patient advocate 
we routinely assist our program members in saving to on their medical bills  and frequently more  by steering them to the most cost effective healthcare providers in their area 
we allow the patient and the healthcare provider to decide treatment protocols with no interference from any third party 
we facilitate the financial transaction between the healthcare provider and patient member to allow the provider to receive prompt payment 
finally  because the patient member is directly responsible for a significant portion of his or her medical expenses  the patient has an incentive to minimize utilization to achieve cost savings  regardless of whether the patient has a high deductible insurance policy or is self insured 
our membership program encompasses all aspects of healthcare  including physicians  hospitals  ancillary services  dentists  prescription drugs  vision care  hearing aids  chiropractic and alternative care  air ambulance  hour nurse hotline assistance  and long term care 
memberships in our care entr e programs range from to per month per family depending on the selected options  plus a one time enrollment fee of to 
affordable healthcare insurance and financial products commencing in september  through our subsidiary  care financial of texas  llc care financial  we began offering our high deductible and scheduled benefit insurance policies 
in addition  we have recently added a suite of products including life insurance and annuities  along with health savings accounts hsas  healthcare reimbursement arrangements hras and medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts fsas offered through care  a division of our foresight  inc subsidiary foresight 
the high deductible and scheduled benefit insurance policies  hsas  hras and medical and dependent care fsas  when combined with the care entr e program  offer affordable  well rounded solutions for individuals and employers who are no longer able to afford or obtain traditional health insurance policies 
while these products are usually sold by licensed life and health insurance agents  the hras and medical and dependent care fsas are also sold by our independent marketing representatives who  from a regulatory standpoint  are not required to be licensed to sell these products 
the life insurance products serve to complement our healthcare product offerings by addressing our members overall financial condition 
the insurance policies are sold through our independent marketing representatives who are licensed insurance agents 
our group and wholesale products we offer three wholesale membership service solutions private label and co brand healthcare programs we design and offer healthcare membership programs for employer groups  retailers and association based organizations 
these programs are marketed under our for your good health label or the privately labeled name of our client 
membership in these programs are offered and sold by direct sales or through marketing companies that ask prospective customers to call a customer service center for more information in bound direct marketing 
we believe that our clients  their members  and the vendors of the products and services offered through the programs  all benefit from our membership service programs 
the products and services are bundled  priced and marketed utilizing relationship marketing strategies or inbound direct marketing to target the profiled needs of the clients particular member base 
repricing for governments and other self funded employers for governments and other large  self funded employers seeking to reduce the cost of offering healthcare benefits to their employees  we can also offer a more streamlined version of our product 
in these cases  we offer access to healthcare through our network of providers and the efficient repricing of bills through our proprietary systems 
we offer these services for a price based on either the number of participants per month or as a percentage of savings on healthcare costs actually realized 
on june   we acquired access  a full service third party administrator  for a purchase price of million  consisting of  of cash and  of our common stock  shares 
through the acquisition of access  we now provide a wide range of healthcare claims administration services and other cost containment procedures that are frequently required by governments and other large employers who have chosen to self fund their healthcare benefits requirements 
access helps us offer a more complete suite of healthcare services 
also through access  we provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical escrow accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
from a sales distribution standpoint  we have the ability to grow access regional business through our numerous independent marketing representatives who sell both to individuals and employer groups throughout the united states 
our acquisition of access serves to complement our most recent entry into the public sector market through our agreement with the state of louisiana 
access primary area of expertise is in the public sector market 
non healthcare related club membership programs through foresight  we also design non healthcare related membership programs for rental purchase companies  financial organizations  employer groups  retailers and association based organizations 
memberships in these programs are also offered and sold as part of a point of sale transaction or by direct marketing through direct mail or as an insert

substantially all of our non healthcare related membership service programs are offered and sold at retail by clients engaged in the rental purchase industry 
sales and marketing channels our care entr e healthcare programs are offered primarily through our network marketing organization initially organized in august or by way of our private label agreements with direct marketing or other sales organizations  including insurance agencies 
network marketing 
our independent representatives become marketing representatives by paying an enrollment fee currently and signing a standard representative agreement  and an annual renewal fee currently 
independent marketing representatives of care entr e are not required to be licensed insurance agents 
independent marketing representatives are paid a commission on the membership fees of each member they enroll for the life of that member s enrollment with care entr e assuming such representative continues to meet certain commission qualifications 
independent marketing representatives may also receive commissions equal to the membership fees if three or more program members are enrolled in a month 
in the month of the membership sales  no override commissions are paid to the representative s upline 
independent marketing representatives may also recruit other representatives and earn override commissions on sales made by those representatives 
we pay a total of in override commissions down through seven levels of marketing representatives 
in addition  we have established bonus pools that allow independent marketing representatives who have achieved certain levels to receive additional commissions measured by our revenues attributable to the care entr e programs 
the total regular or ongoing commissions payout  including overrides on second month membership sales and onward and the amount contributed by us to the bonus pools  can be as high as of qualified membership sales 
wholesale membership or private label clients and direct sales 
primarily through our direct sales team we also contractwith other companies under wholesale co branded or private label arrangements 
under these agreements  we conduct all customer service and re pricing operations and may also provide the fulfillment and collections services 
the client performs all marketing functions 
we intend to expand on our wholesale strategy by also targeting self funded employers and organizations providing administrative services to employee benefit plans in order to have our healthcare products sold to groups of employees on a stand alone basis or as part of an employee benefit plan 
business objectives and plans our objective is to sustain and expand our leadership position as a provider of unique healthcare membership service programs and consumer driven healthcare plans 
key elements of our business plan are as follows continue to develop unique healthcare service programs for broad markets 
our focus is on the continued development and introduction of unique programs that address the health and lifestyle needs of targeted consumer groups 
we anticipate that this plan will allow us to obtain a larger share of the healthcare market through existing marketing channels and through establishment of new client relationships 
our subsidiary  care financial of texas  llc care financial operates  in many ways  like an insurance agency 
through care financial  we continue to offer high deductible and scheduled benefit insurance policies  but have also added a suite of products  including life insurance and annuities 
the use of these policies in conjunction with the care entr e program can provide a very affordable solution to individuals and groups who previously could not afford fully inclusive medical plans and provide greater assurance of payment to the healthcare providers 
these insurance products are for sale only by our marketing representatives who are also licensed insurance agents 
in the fourth quarter of  we established care 
care provides the administration behind a variety of employee benefit programs that allow employers and employees to save money by paying for certain irs approved expenses on a pre tax basis 
care can assist employers in the offering of health reimbursement arrangements hras  flexible spending accounts fsas  and arrangements to help their employees pay for dependant care and transportation expenses 
in the case of the flexible spending accounts for dependant care  employers can offer these plans as an additional benefit to their employees at no additional cost to the employer because these fees are based on a percentage of the tax savings realized by the employer in redirecting salary costs for distribution on a pre tax basis 
the remaining fees for services provided by care are monthly fees based on the number of members enrolled 
care is positioned to provide administrative support services for employers wishing to offer their employees a health savings account hsa 
with recent developments to federal tax policy encouraging the use of hsa s  we expect that this portion of care s business will expand 
continue to develop a recurring revenue base 
growth in recurring revenue from the care entr e product is dependent on our independent marketing representatives continuing to market the care entr e program memberships and recruit new downline independent marketing representatives 
we intend to continually increase our support for representatives to maximize the volume generated through this sales channel 
recurring revenue from wholesale and private label clients is dependent upon the client continuously marketing our products to their customer base 
we intend to continue to focus our efforts on retaining our existing clients and obtaining new wholesale and private label clients through our direct sales team 
develop a corporate level sales team 
to complement the individual sales and group sales and lead generation accomplished through our network marketing strategy  we have undertaken a strategy to promote sales to groups and self funded employers with a corporate level sales team having experience with the group insurance market and the operations of a third party administrator 
leverage and develop multiple network partners 
while we currently have a contractual relationship with a well recognized and fully developed preferred provider organization network for access to savings on doctors  hospitals  and ancillary healthcare services  we need to continuously asses the capabilities of that network and work towards providing alternative network solutions for our members 
provide high quality customer service 
in order to achieve our anticipated growth and to ensure client  member and marketing representative loyalty  we continue to develop and invest significantly in our member service systems 
we have developed a proprietary computer database system that provides customer service representatives immediate access to provider demographic data  re pricing information and member information  including the components of each member program or plan and the details a member requires to properly utilize the program 
develop and market innovative product offerings 
in december  we began offering a medical savings program to help provide assurance that healthcare providers would be paid on a timely basis 
our members deposit money into their individual escrow accounts on a monthly basis from which healthcare services are paid in whole or in part 
a member s ability to pay is then certified prior to treatment or hospitalization based in part on the balance of the member s escrow account 
we hope to also offer our members access to a medical line of credit that can be accessed in addition to or in lieu of a funded escrow account 
this line of credit would allow our members to have access to healthcare providers without an upfront cash outlay 
developing a line of credit offering that is easily accessible by a majority of our members is time consuming and difficult 
we hope to have this offering available by the end of continue to expand our third party administrator services 
in response to the needs of our group customers  we have expanded our third party administrator tpa services 
our acquisition of access healthsource  inc in allows us to offer a full service tpa function that includes full plan administration  claims adjudication and claims management services 
we plan on developing a marketing plan to offer these new tpa service capabilities on a national basis

groups of five or more can also choose to be billed on a monthly basis

the processing fee is non refundable 
upon enrollment  new members receive a member kit that includes instructions on using the program  directories for their area and identification cards 
network contracts we contract with numerous preferred provider organization and other medical networks for access to their negotiated rates 
we do not contract directly with any medical providers 
we only select and utilize those networks that we believe can deliver adequate savings to our members  while providing support for our program with the healthcare providers 
we pay each network utilized a per member per month amount for use of the network 
each network is only paid for those members authorized to utilize the network 
most of our network contracts are generally for a one year term  with subsequent one year renewal terms at our or the network s option 
networks may cancel their contracts with us  but in most cases  subject to notice provisions to provide time to locate a substitute network 
most of our network contracts are not exclusive  but have requirements that the network and we maintain the confidentiality of the terms of the contract 
our principal preferred provider organization through which our members receive savings on healthcare services through our care entr e program is private healthcare systems  inc customer service we believe that a high level of customer service is critical to the success of its program 
we provide customer service for three types of individuals or organizations our marketing representatives  so that they can be more effective in selling the program  our members  in order to assure that they achieve the best available savings when utilizing the program  and the providers  who require assistance in a understanding how the program works for them and b in verifying eligibility and arranging for the payment of the amount billed to the patient for each procedure performed 
toll free support is provided for the members and providers 
we maintain multiple customer service centers with a total of customer service representatives as of december  these employees provide support for our members  our independent marketing representatives  and for providers 
our member and provider service centers are available monday through thursday from am to am central time and am to am on friday 
our marketing representative service center is available monday through friday from am to am central time 
all new customer service representatives must have a medical background  either processing insurance claims or working in a medical office 
extensive on the job training is also provided to them 
utilizing our systems  the customer service representatives are able to provide friendly but efficient service to our members  marketing representatives  and network providers 
representative training we provide extensive training to our marketing representatives to assure that they accurately represent our products and services 
this training is available in a variety of forms  including a training manual  audio  and videotapes  local and regional training meetings and weekly conference calls 
the training encompasses both product training as well as marketing training and sales techniques 
we have certain policies and procedures in place to control any advertising or promotions that are utilized by our marketing representatives 
these policies and procedures are necessary to assure the proper representation of the program at all times and include the pre approval of all advertising  adherence to anti spamming and anti fax blasting rules  and limits where representatives can advertise 
a representative s failure to follow these rules can result in fines or termination 
technology we have made substantial investments in our proprietary technology and management information systems 
these systems were designed in house and are used in most aspects of our business  including maintaining member eligibility and demographic information  maintaining representative information including genealogy reporting  paying commissions  maintaining a database of all providers and providing provider locator services  re pricing and payment of medical bills  drafting members accounts on a monthly basis  and tracking of cash receipts and revenues 
during  we upgraded our technology and management information systems 
these systems allow for more timely processing of business transactions and contain e commerce capabilities 
we have also established extensive web sites for our programs that provide information about the program  allow for provider searches and allow new members and representatives to enroll on line 
the websites also allow representatives  through a password protected area to access support and training files and to view their genealogy and commission information 
the websites are set up as self replicating websites to allow representatives a copy of the websites under a unique web address 
governmental regulation we are subject to federal  state and local laws  regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints hereinafter regulations 
because the nature of our services is relatively new to the marketplace  we may not be able to accurately predict which regulations will be applied to our business and we may become subject to new or amended regulations 
some of the areas of our business that are or may be governed by current or future regulations are our healthcare products  in that there is a possibility that our care entr e membership program will be regulated as an insurance company  our product claims and advertising including direct claims and advertising as well as claims and advertising by independent marketing representatives  for which we may be held responsible  our network marketing organization  and our medical escrow accounts held on behalf of our members 
possible insurance company regulation 
our care entree program is not an insurance program and we are not subject to regulation as an insurance company or a seller of insurance 
however  regulations in certain states currently regulate or restrict the offering of our programs 
occasionally  we receive inquires from insurance commissioners in various states that require us to supply information about our care entr e program  representatives  etc 
to the insurance commissioner or other state regulatory agency 
to date  these agencies have concurred with our view that these programs are not a form of insurance and are being sold in a proper manner 
there is no assurance that this situation will not change in the future  and an insurance commissioner will successfully challenge our ability to offer our programs without compliance with state insurance regulation 
furthermore  several states have recently enacted or introduced legislation and or regulations that will likely affect the manner by which we sell our programs 
because this legislation is new  we do not yet know the scope of that effect and there is a risk that compliance with such legislation and or regulations could have material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition 
there is also the risk that a state will adopt regulations or enact legislation restricting or prohibiting the sale of our medical discount programs in the state 
our care entr e program is also subject to the review of the attorney generals in each state  particularly as it relates to the network marketing aspect of the program 
the care entr e commission plan was designed to meet the requirements of each state  and we have had no challenges of the plan from any state attorney general 
however  the laws in any state or the interpretation of these laws could change at any time and we may be prevented from selling memberships in our care entr e programs as a result of the changes 
compliance with federal and state regulations is generally our responsibility 
the medical discount program industry is especially susceptible to charges by the media of regulatory noncompliance and unfair dealing 
as is often the case  the media may publicize perceived non compliance with consumer protection regulations and violations of notions of fair dealing with consumers 
our failure to comply with current  as well as newly enacted or adopted federal and state regulations  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations in addition to the following non compliance may cause us to become the subject of a variety of enforcement or private actions  compliance with changes in applicable regulations could materially increase the associated operating costs  non compliance with any rules and regulations enforced by a federal or state consumer protection authority may subject us or our management personnel to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution  and non compliance or alleged non compliance may result in negative publicity potentially damaging our reputation  network relationships  client relationships and the relationship with program members  representatives and consumers in general 
product claims and advertising 
the federal trade commission and certain states regulate advertising  product claims  and other consumer matters  including advertising of our products 
all advertising  promotional and solicitation materials used by marketing representatives require our approval prior to use 
the federal trade commission may institute enforcement actions against companies for false and misleading advertising of consumer products 
in addition  the federal trade commission has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials  including those used by us and our marketing representatives 
we have not been the target of federal trade commission enforcement action 
there is no assurance that the federal trade commission will not question our advertising or other operations in the future  a state will not interpret product claims presumptively valid under federal law as illegal under that state s regulations  or future federal trade commission regulations or decisions will not restrict the permissible scope of such claims 
we are also subject to the risk of claims by marketing representatives and their customers who may file actions on their own behalf  as a class or otherwise  and may file complaints with the federal trade commission or state or local consumer affairs offices 
these agencies may take action on their own initiative against us for alleged advertising or product claim violations  or on a referral from independent marketing representatives  customers or others 
remedies sought in these actions may include consent decrees and the refund of amounts paid by the complaining independent marketing representatives or consumer  refunds to an entire class of independent marketing representatives or customers  client refunds  or other damages  as well as changes in our method of doing business 
a complaint based on the practice of one marketing representative  whether or not we authorized the practice  could result in an order affecting some or all of our marketing representatives in a particular state 
also  an order in one state could influence courts or government agencies in other states considering similar matters 
proceedings resulting from these complaints could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments or judgments and could have a material adverse effect on us 
network marketing organization 
our network marketing system is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the federal trade commission and various state agencies 
these regulations are generally directed at ensuring that advancement  within a network marketing organization  is based on sales of the organization s products rather than investment in the organization or other non sales related criteria 
for instance  in certain markets there are limits on the extent that marketing representatives may earn royalties on sales generated by marketing representatives that were not directly sponsored by the marketing representative 
our network marketing organization and activities are subject to scrutiny by various state and federal governmental regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with various types of laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include securities  franchise investment  business opportunity  and criminal laws prohibiting the use of pyramid or endless chain types of selling organizations 
the compensation structure of these selling organizations is very complex  and compliance with all of the applicable laws is uncertain in light of evolving interpretation of existing laws and the enactment of new laws and regulations pertaining to this type of product distribution 
we are not aware of any legal actions pending or threatened by any governmental authority against us regarding the legality of our network marketing operations 
as of december   we had marketing representatives in states and the district of columbia 
we review the requirements of various states  as well as seek legal advice  regarding the structure and operation of our network marketing ensure that it complies with all of the applicable laws and regulations pertaining to network sales organizations 
based on these efforts and the experience of our management  we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulatory requirements 
we have not obtained no action letters or advance rulings from any federal or state security regulator or other governmental agency concerning the legality of our network operations  nor are we relying on a formal opinion of counsel to that effect 
we accordingly are subject to the risk that one or more of our network marketing organizations could be found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations 
our failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on us in a particular market or in general 
we are subject to the risk of challenges to the legality of our network marketing organization  including claims by our marketing representatives  both individually and as a class 
most likely these claims would be based on the network marketing organization allegedly being operated as an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities laws  state unfair practice and fraud laws  and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
in the event of challenges to the legality of our network marketing organization by distributors  we would be required to demonstrate that our network marketing organization complies with applicable regulatory laws 
a final ruling against us could result in a material liability 
moreover  even if we were successful in defending against these challenges  the costs of such defense  both in dollars spent and in management time  could be material and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the negative publicity of these challenges could adversely affect our revenues and ability to attract and retain marketing representatives 
health insurance portability and accountability act compliance 
in december  the department of health and human services issued final privacy regulations pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa that became effective in april hipaa and the applicable regulations impose extensive restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by certain entities 
also as part of hipaa  the department of health and human services has issued final regulations standardizing electronic transactions between health plans  providers and clearinghouses 
health plans  providers  and clearinghouses  are required to conform their electronic and data processing systems with hipaa s electronic transaction requirements 
we may be required to comply with certain aspects of these regulations pertaining to our business 
our recently purchased re pricing software systems are considered hipaa compliant 
we previously engaged a consulting firm to assist us in our efforts to continuously comply with all other hipaa regulations 
we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations 
however  because these regulations are new  we do not know how the interpretation and enforcement of the regulations may affect us 
we plan to continually audit our compliance  and accordingly cannot give assurance that our costs of continuing to comply with hipaa will not be material to us 
sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal penalties and civil sanctions 
competition consumer healthcare savings programs 
while the medical savings industry is still in its early stages  competition for members is becoming more intense 
we offer membership programs that provide products and services similar to or directly in competition with products and services offered by our network marketing competitors as well as the providers of the products and services through other channels of distribution 
although not permitted under the current agreements with our representatives and private label clients  in the future some of our clients may provide  either directly or through third parties  programs that directly compete with our programs 
competition for new representatives is intense  as these individuals have a variety of products that they can choose to market  whether competing with us in the healthcare market or not 
our principal competitors are ameriplan  full access medical  new benefits  inc  careington international  and international association of businesses iab 
we also compete with all types of network marketing companies throughout the us for new representatives 
our other competitors include large retailers  financial institutions  insurance companies  preferred provider organization networks  and other organizations  which offer benefit programs to their customers 
many of our competitors have substantially larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources 
we distinguish ourselves from the competition through the offering of toll free live customer service to the providers  as well as  the members 
our staff is adequately trained to provide not only customer support  but also member steerage so that our members are able to achieve additional medical savings by obtaining the best rates even within the same medical provider network 
additionally  through our subsidiary third party administrator  foresight  inc  we offer an escrow account program that helps ensure payment to our medical providers 
we are not aware of any other competitor that offers customer service to the medical providers and members in this manner 
principal competitive factors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the consumer healthcare and wholesale membership industries  some of which are not within our control  include the ability to maintain contracts with reputable preferred provider organization networks that offer substantial healthcare savings  the ability to identify  develop and offer unique membership healthcare programs  the quality and breadth of the membership programs offered  the quality and extent of customer service  the ability to offer substantial savings on the major medical costs such as hospital and surgical costs  the ability to combine the programs with affordable insurance plans that have high deductibles or set payment for hospitalization  prices of products and service offered  marketing expertise  compensation plans for representatives  the ability to hire and retain employees  the development by others of member programs that are competitive with care entr e s programs  responsiveness to customer needs  the ability to satisfy investigations on the part of state attorney generals  insurance commissioners and other regulatory bodies  the ability to finance promotions for the recruiting of members and representatives  and the ability to effectively market the product on the world wide web 
while we are considered a leader in the industry  there is no assurance that competitors will not develop their own software that re prices medical bills  a full service customer service function similar to ours  or a medical escrow concept similar to ours  our competitors will not increase their emphasis on programs similar to our programs to more effectively compete with us  our competitors will not recruit our independent marketing representatives by offering more attractive sales commissions  our competitors will not provide programs comparable or superior to our programs at lower membership fees  our competitors will not adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements  new competitors will not enter the market  other businesses such as insurance companies or preferred provider organization networks will not themselves introduce competing programs  and competitors may develop more effective marketing campaigns that more effectively utilize direct mail and television advertising 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of december   we had full time employees in the following departments customer services executive and administration information services provider relations data entry finance and accounting quality assurance sales and marketing utilization review and management care financial foresight wholesale memberships our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel in all areas of our operations 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we provide no assurance that we can retain key managerial and technical employees  or that we can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages  and consider our employee relations to be good 
additional factors that may affect our future results the matters discussed below and elsewhere in this report should be considered when evaluating our business operations and strategies 
additionally  there may be risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial  which may become material factors affecting our operations and business success 
many of the factors are not within our control 
we provide no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect the market price of our common stock  adversely affect our future operations  adversely affect our business  adversely affect our financial condition  or adversely affect our results of operations  require significant reduction or discontinuance of our operations  require us to seek a merger partner  or require us to sell additional stock on terms that are highly dilutive to our shareholders 
this report contains cautionary statements relating to forward looking information 
we have included some forward looking statements in this section and other places in this report regarding our expectations 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
some of these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology including believes  expects  may  will  should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategies that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future operating results or of our future financial condition  or state other forward looking information 
we believe it is important to discuss our expectations  however  it must be recognized that events may occur in the future over which we have no control and which we are not accurately able to predict 
our revenues are primarily dependent on the independent marketing representatives  whose reduced sales efforts or termination may result in significant loss of revenues 
our success and growth depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate the network of independent marketing representatives who principally market our care entr e medical savings program 
our independent marketing representatives typically offer and sell the care entr e program on a part time basis  and may engage in other business activities 
these marketing representatives may give higher priority to other products or services  reducing their efforts devoted to marketing our care entr e program 
also  our ability to attract and retain marketing representatives could be negatively affected by adverse publicity relating to our care entr e program and operations 
under our network marketing system  the marketing representatives downline organizations are headed by a relatively small number of key representatives who are responsible for a substantial percentage of our total revenues 
the loss of a significant number of marketing representatives  including any key representatives  for any reason  could adversely affect our revenues and operating results  and could impair our ability to attract new distributors 
development and maintenance of relationships with preferred provider organizations are critical and the loss of such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as part of our business operations  we must develop and maintain relationships with preferred provider organizations within each market area that our services are offered 
development and maintenance of these relationships with healthcare providers within a preferred provider organization is in part based on professional relationships and the reputation of our management and marketing personnel 
because many members that receive healthcare services are self insured and responsible for payment for healthcare services received  failure to pay or late payment by members may negatively affect our relationship with the preferred provider organizations 
consequently  preferred provider organization relationships may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  including departures of key personnel and alterations in professional relationships and members failures to pay for services received 
the loss of a preferred provider organization within a geographic market area may not be replaced on a timely basis  if at all 
the loss of a preferred provider organization for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we currently rely heavily on one key preffered provider organization and the loss of or a change in our relationship with this provider could have a material adverse effect on our business 
private healthcare systems  inc is the principal preferred provider organization through which our members receive savings on healthcare services through our care entr e program 
the loss of private healthcare systems as a preferred provider organization or disruption of our members access to this preferred provider organization could adversely affect our business 
while we currently enjoy a good relationship with private healthcare systems  there are no assurances that we will continue to have a good relationship with this network in the future  or that the network may choose to partner with one of our competitors or compete directly with our care entr e program 
we face competition for marketing representatives as well as competitive offerings of healthcare products and services 
although the medical savings membership industry is in the early stages of its development  competition for members is becoming more intense 
we offer membership programs that provide products and services similar to or directly in competition with products and services offered by our network marketing competitors as well as the providers of such products and services through other channels of distribution 
although not permitted under the current agreements with our marketing representatives and private label clients  in the future some of our clients may provide  either directly or through third parties  programs that directly compete with our programs 
furthermore  marketing representatives have a variety of products that they can choose to market  whether competing with us in the healthcare market or not 
our business operations compete in two channels of competition 
first  we compete based upon the healthcare products and services offered 
these competitors include companies that offer healthcare products and services through membership programs much like our programs  as well as insurance companies  preferred provider organization networks and other organizations that offer benefit programs to their customers 
second  we compete with all types of network marketing companies throughout the us for new marketing representatives 
many of our competitors have substantially larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources 
we provide no assurance that our competitors will not provide healthcare benefit programs comparable or superior to our programs at lower membership prices or adapt more quickly to evolving healthcare industry trends or changing industry requirements 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current and future competitors 
we may become subject to government regulation much like an insurance company 
such regulatory oversight may affect or limit our operations 
the membership and healthcare benefits we offer are sold without license by any federal  state  or local regulatory licensing agency or commission 
in comparison  companies that provide insurance benefits and operate healthcare management organizations and preferred provider organizations are regulated by state licensing agencies and commissions 
these regulations extensively cover operations  including scope of benefits  rate formula  delivery systems  utilization review procedures  quality assurance  enrollment requirements  claim payments  marketing and advertising 
in the future  state insurance regulatory agencies and commissions may determine that our care entr e programs are subject to governmental regulation  which may adversely affect or limit our future operations 
we have a fiduciary responsibilty to our members through our total care and essential care program offerings 
in this capacity  we could be liable for the loss of members funds deposited with us in escrow 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a medical savings program through our total care and essential care programs that is processed through our subsidiary foresight as a third party administrator 
under this medical savings program  funds collected from members are held in escrow for the benefit of the member as a source of payment for healthcare services obtained through our total care and essential care programs 
under the medical savings program we have a fiduciary responsibility to our members for the funds held for their benefit much like a trustee 
in the unforeseen event of a loss of these funds while being held by us or our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal controls  we will be responsible and liable to the affected members for any such loss  including any consequential damages suffered by the members  which liability could be substantial 
as a result of the introduction of medical escrow accounts  our financial position and results of operations may continue to be adversely impacted by a decrease in the number of healthcare savings program memberships that we can sell and maintain 
while we believe that the introduction of our medical escrow accounts was an important development in our product  the initial impact of such introduction has negatively affected our business 
this impact is the result of additional difficulties in selling and maintaining memberships in our program because of the added complexity 
there is no assurance that we will be able to overcome these difficulties  and we may not be able to increase the number of memberships that are sold and maintained 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected 
the failure of our network marketing organization to comply with federal and state regulation could result in enforcement action and imposition of penalties  modification of our network marketing system  and negative publicity 
our network marketing organization is subject to federal and state laws and regulations administered by the federal trade commission and various state agencies 
these laws and regulations include securities  franchise investment  business opportunity  and criminal laws prohibiting the use of pyramid or endless chain types of selling organizations 
these regulations are generally directed at ensuring that product and service sales are ultimately made to consumers as opposed to other marketing representatives and that advancement within the network marketing organization is based on sales of products and services  rather than on investment in the company or other non retail sales related criteria 
the compensation structure of a network marketing organization is very complex 
compliance with all of the applicable regulations and laws is uncertain because of the evolving interpretations of existing laws and regulations  and the enactment of new laws and regulations pertaining in general to network marketing organizations and product and service distribution 
accordingly  there is the risk that our network marketing system could be found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations that could result in enforcement action and imposition of penalty  require modification of the marketing representative network system  result in negative publicity  or have a negative effect on distributor morale and loyalty 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as well as our financial condition 
the legality of our network marketing organization is subject to challenge by our marketing representatives  which could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments or judgments  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our network marketing organization is subject to legality challenge by our marketing representatives  both individually and as a class 
generally  these challenges would be based on claims that our marketing network program was operated as an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities laws  state unfair practice and fraud laws and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
proceedings resulting from these claims could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments  or judgments  and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may have exposure and liability relating to non compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the cost of compliance could be material 
in december  the department of health and human services issued final privacy regulations pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa that became effective in april hipaa imposes extensive restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by certain entities 
also as part of hipaa  the department of health and human services has issued final regulations standardizing electronic transactions between health plans  providers and clearinghouses 
health plans  providers and clearinghouses are required to conform their electronic and data processing systems with hipaa s electronic transaction requirements 
while we believe we are currently compliant with these regulations  we cannot be certain of the extent to which the enforcement or interpretation of these regulations will affect our business 
our continuing compliance with these regulations  therefore  may have a significant impact on our business operations and may be at material cost in the event we are subject to these regulations 
sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal and civil sanctions 
the program marketing activities conducted by our subsidiary foresight are dependent upon our clients 
in carrying out our program marketing activities through our subsidiary foresight  inc  we are dependent on our clients utilizing our services to design membership programs for their customers 
the client approves each marketing program prior to presentation to the client s customers 
our client relationships are pursuant to written agreements that typically may be terminated pursuant to day written notice prior to end to the term of the agreement without cause and without penalty 
generally  upon termination  the client may not offer similar products or services for a one year period  however  we are not prohibited from continuing to offer or provide membership services and products directly or indirectly to the client s individual customers 
if the agreement is terminated due to our default  we are prohibited from renewing memberships and the client has the right to cause us to terminate our relationship with existing program members 
many of the events that constitute default are not within our control  including acts and omissions by our third party product and service vendors or providers 
there is no assurance that our clients will not terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide additional customer lists for our use in further marketing of new or existing membership programs 
we are currently implementing a new management information system 
disruption in our operation resulting from this implementation could affect our client relationships 
we recently transitioned to our new management information system 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue operating without experiencing any disruptions in our operations or that our relationships with our members  marketing representatives or providers will not be adversely affected or that our internal controls will not be adversely affected 
we assumed a contingent tax liability in connection with our merger acquisition of foresight 
in january  universal marketing services  inc  the former parent of our wholly owned subsidiary  foresight  inc  purchased the outstanding common stock of foresight for  universal marketing services agreed to indemnify the shareholders of foresight for the increase in federal income taxes  and any applicable penalties to the extent that the reported  of the purchase price does not qualify for long term capital gain treatment 
in connection with our merger acquisition of foresight  we assumed the indemnification obligation of universal marketing services 
upon examination  the internal revenue service may take the position that all or a portion of the  should be classified as ordinary income taxable at the maximum federal income tax rate of rather than the long term capital gain rate 
in the event the internal revenue service successfully asserts that long term capital gain classification was improper  we will be required to indemnify the former shareholders 
we have many competitors and may not be able to compete effectively which may lead to a lack of revenues and discontinuance of our operations 
we compete with numerous well established companies that design and implement membership programs 
some of our competitors may be companies that have programs that are functionally similar or superior to our membership programs 
most of our competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than us 
they may also have established reputations relating to membership programs 
due to competitive market forces  we may experience price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in the future  any of which would result in decreases in sales and revenues 
these decreases in revenues would adversely affect our business and results of operations and could lead to discontinuance of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully  our competitors will not develop membership programs that render our programs less marketable or even obsolete  or we will be able to successfully enhance our programs when necessary 
the goodwill acquired pursuant to our acquisitions of the capella group and access may become impaired and require a write down and the recognition of an impairment expense which may be substantial 
in connection with our acquisitions of the capella group and access  we recorded goodwill that  at december   had an aggregate asset value of  in the event that the goodwill is determined to be impaired for any reason  we will be required to write down or reduce the value of the goodwill and recognize an impairment expense 
the impairment expense may be substantial in amount and  in such case  adversely affect the results of our operations for the applicable period and may negatively affect the market value of our common stock 
we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of access and that failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction as a result of  among other things  the failure of access to renew or maintain its existing service agreements 
in addition  the integration of access business and operations with those of precis may take longer than anticipated  may be more costly than anticipated  and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to access or precis existing businesses or customer base 
if we issue substantial shares of our common stock upon access meeting certain ebitda targets  our shareholders could suffer dilution of their investment and our stock price could decline 
we are obligated to issue a number of additional common stock shares in the event access attains certain levels of earnings before income tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined in the purchase contract 
should a significant number of these shares be issued  the resulting increase in the number of outstanding common stock shares could have a substantial dilutive effect on our outstanding common stock as of the date of this report their market value 
the issuance of additional common stock may also adversely affect the terms under which we could obtain additional equity capital 
our subsidiary  access  derives a large percentage of its income from a few key clients and the loss of any of those clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
access provides full service third party administration services to adjudicate and pay medical claims for employers who have self funded at least a portion of their healthcare costs 
their primary market is governmental entities in the el paso  texas metropolitan area  including cities and school districts 
there are a limited number of such entities in that area 
a material portion of the revenues of access is derived from its contractual relationships with a few key governmental entities 
the loss of any of these relationships would adversely affect on our operating results and the loss of more than one of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
item description of property our corporate offices  operations  and insurance agency are located in  square feet at n 
highway  grand prairie  texas the offices are occupied under a lease agreement with an unaffiliated third party that expires december  we consider the space which our offices occupy to be adequate for our needs 
in the event we are required to relocate our office upon termination of the existing leases  we believe other office space is available under comparable lease terms 
our financial commitment on this lease runs through december  description payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years operating leases on real property item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we may become involved in litigation or in settlement proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview consumer healthcare savings solutions 
we offer savings on healthcare services throughout the united states to persons who are under insured 
these savings are offered by accessing the same preferred provider organizations ppos that are utilized by many insurance companies 
these programs are sold primarily through a network marketing strategy under the name care entr e 
we design these programs to benefit healthcare providers as well as the network members 
providers commonly give reduced or preferred rates to ppo networks in exchange for steerage of patients 
however  the providers must still file claim forms and wait to days to be paid for their services 
our programs utilize these same networks to obtain the same savings for the care entr e program members 
however  the healthcare providers are paid immediately for their services and are not required to file claim forms 
we provide transaction facilitation services to both the program member and the healthcare provider 
independent marketing representatives imrs may enroll as representatives by paying an enrollment fee and signing a standard representative agreement 
we pay independent marketing representatives commissions equal to of the membership fees of members they enroll for the life of that members enrollment

self funded employer healthcare plans for governments and other large  self funded employers seeking to reduce the cost of offering healthcare benefits to their employees  we can also offer a more streamlined version of our product 
in these cases  we offer access to healthcare through our network of providers and the efficient repricing of bills through our proprietary systems 
we can offer these services on a price based on either the number of participants per month or as a percentage of savings on healthcare costs actually realized 
on june   we acquired access  a full service third party administrator  for a purchase price of million  consisting of  of cash and  of the company s stock 
in addition to the purchase price consideration  there is a contingency payout should the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of access reach certain amounts after the closing of the transaction and before december  ebitda  while not considered a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  is the financial measurement utilized for the basis of the contingency payout and additional purchase price payments are dependent on access achieving certain ebitda levels 
currently  access earnings are on a pace to exceed those ebitda targets 
through the acquisition of access  we now provide a wide range of healthcare claims administration services and other cost containment procedures that are frequently required by governments and other employers who have chosen to self fund their healthcare benefits requirements 
access helps us offer a more complete suite of healthcare services 
we are now able to provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical escrow accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
from a sales distribution standpoint  we have the ability to grow access regional business through our numerous independent marketing representatives who sell both to individuals and employer groups throughout the united states 
our acquisition of access serves to complement our most recent entry into the public sector market through our agreement with the state of louisiana

the insurance policies are sold through our independent marketing representatives who are licensed insurance agents 
wholesale membership solution healthcare membership programs we also design healthcare membership programs for employer groups and third party marketers 
memberships in these programs are offered and sold by direct marketing through direct sales or in bound direct marketing 
we believe that our clients  their members  and the vendors of the products and services offered through the programs  all benefit from our membership service programs 
the products and services are bundled  priced and marketed utilizing relationship marketing strategies or inbound direct marketing to target the profiled needs of the clients particular member base 
our memberships sold by third party organizations are generally marketed using the third party s name or brand or under our wholesale brand for your good health 
we refer to these programs and membership sales as wholesale programs or private label programs 
while the services offered to consumers by these private label programs are generally similar to the services we offer through care entr e  each of the private label programs can bundle our services to fit the needs of their consumers 
for instance  some of our private label programs do not offer a self funded escrow program to their members 
rental purchase and club membership programs we also design club membership programs for rental purchase companies  financial organizations  employer groups  retailers and association based organizations

revenues from these programs have represented a lesser portion of the company s total revenues in recent years than in the past 
benefits to members of our programs we believe that our programs offer members an economic  efficient and convenient method for the selection of products and services 
members are entitled to savings for products and services that may not otherwise be available to them 
vendors of products and services offered and sold through the programs to members are benefited 
vendors are provided the opportunity to reach a large number of demographically targeted customers with minimal incremental marketing cost 
operational review for the year ended december  the year ended december  was very much another transitional year for us 
we implemented member escrow accounts during the fourth quarter of in response to the market changes in the healthcare savings industry  and on october   we expanded the escrow requirements to all programs offering access to medical doctors and physicians 
as a result of this change  we now require all of our members to escrow funds with us prior to utilizing any physician  hospital or ancillary services 
as of december   the percentage of our individual members who have escrowed funds with us was approximately of the total individual healthcare membership base 
this excludes our private label programs  where the escrow requirements have not been mandated 
our healthcare membership base was approximately  members as of december  as compared to  members as of december   a decrease of approximately  members or 
the reduction in our healthcare membership base was primarily due to the implementation of the escrow account requirements for hospitalized care in the fourth quarter of  and expansion to physicians and doctors commencing on october  in addition  our healthcare savings program has experienced issues with provider acceptance in some markets 
as a result of some of healthcare program changes introduced during and  our independent marketing representative base experienced a significant reduction in and we  however  continue to maintain the majority of our core business leaders whose downline organizations generate a substantial portion of our revenues 
although these escrow requirements negatively impacted our membership base and consequently our revenues and net earnings in  these changes were required to help provide assurance of payment to the healthcare providers and accordingly  their continued willingness to provide healthcare services to our members 
this strategic move was critical to our long term operational and financial viability in the health card savings market as many healthcare providers throughout the united states will no longer accept a health discount card 
the success of our new healthcare product offering has not been fully determined 
therefore  its long term impact on both revenues and net earnings is currently unknown and may not be known for some time 
the growth of our members escrow or cash in trust to  as of december  from  as of december  and from  as of december  and provides preliminary although not conclusive evidence of the acceptance of this form of medical savings product offering 
our operating results did benefit from the acquisition of access in june of while included in operations for only slightly more than six months during  access contributed  or to our revenue and  of net earnings after taxes to partially offset our other losses 
access has successfully secured multi year contracts on favorable terms with its two largest clients and has brought us a stable source of revenue 
moreover  we have realized certain intangible benefits from the acquisition 
for instance  we have broadened the management responsibilities of several members of access management team to company wide roles 
our new chief operating officer  frank apodaca  is the president and ceo of access and he will be implementing  on a company wide basis  operational controls that have been successful at access 
in the fourth quarter of  we began reorganizing and rebuilding our corporate sales team to be better positioned to enter into the large self insured employer group and medical benefits market 
we restructured our in house sales team and in january hired a executive vice president of sales and marketing to lead this area  both from a strategy and execution standpoint 
our medical savings product offering in conjunction with our care medical savings account provide an alternative healthcare product offering for a growing number of companies that have chosen to move towards the self funded and or high deductible insurance route 
the group division has positioned itself for growth in by implementing a more focused sales strategy that capitalizes on both the consumer driven health care interest sweeping the group marketplace as well as the continued decline in group insurance participation due to the unrelenting rise in group health care insurance costs 
by being able to now package its hra and hsa products  self funded capabilities  and an a rated high deductible major medical plan through a newly formed partnership  precis is positioned to offer a true consumer driven healthcare strategy to the group marketplace 
also by repackaging its non insurance healthcare saving programs so that it can be effectively sold by the largest worksite brokers in the country we can now aggressively market a cost effective non insurance solution to those employees and or their dependents who can no longer participate in their groups healthcare insurance plan due to soaring costs 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition healthcare membership revenues the company recognizes membership revenues  other than initial enrollment fees  on each monthly anniversary date 
membership revenues are reduced by the amount of refunds estimated to be incurred 
for members that are billed directly  collection of the billed amount is collected almost entirely by automated clearing house electronic check or by electronic charge to the members credit card 
the settlement of those charges occurs within a day or two 
in a minority of cases  the membership fees may be billed to the member by our private label partners  and then our portion of such revenue is remitted to us on a periodic basis 
during the time from the billing of such member fees and their remittance to us  we record a receivable from those private label partners  for which management must estimate an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
member enrollment fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the estimated membership period  which averages eight to ten months 
independent marketing representative fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract 
judgment is involved in the allocation of costs to determine the direct costs netted against those deferred revenues  as well as in estimating the membership period over which to amortize such net revenue 
the company maintains analysis of such costs and collects statistics on such membership periods as a basis for adjusting these estimates from time to time 
access third party administration access recognizes revenue based upon the individual contract arrangements that it has with each of its clients  ie  when the contractual obligations are satisfied 
rental purchase and club membership revenues rental purchase and club membership revenues are recognized in the month that our products and services have been delivered to our clients 
we sell rental purchase and club membership programs on a wholesale basis to our clients 
the wholesale client remits a portion of the rental purchase and club membership revenues to us and retains the balance as compensation for having made the sale 
we provide an allowance for those accounts that we consider to be uncollectible 
commission expense commissions are paid to our independent marketing representatives in the month following the month in which a member has enrolled in our care entr e program 
commissions are only paid in the following month when the related monthly membership fees have been received 
we do not pay advanced commissions on membership sales 
the amounts of commission are based upon established commission schedules and are determined and accrued based upon the recognition the related healthcare membership revenue  as described above 
acquisitions during  we acquired access for a total purchase price of  that purchase price consideration was allocated in the following amounts i  has been allocated to net working capital components primarily based upon their respective present values of amounts to be received and paid  ii  has been allocated to a contract acquired in the acquisition of access based upon its estimated fair value  iii  has been allocated to fixed assets based upon their estimated replacement costs and iv  has been allocated to goodwill based upon the excess of the cost of access over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as previously described 
the allocation of  to goodwill is considered appropriate  as access strategically complements the company s healthcare service offering 
fixed assets property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes and principally on accelerated methods for tax purposes 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
the estimation of useful lives involves judgment and is based  in part  upon past experience with similar assets and upon management s plans for the utilization of assets in the future 
we periodically reviews property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets will be written down to their fair value 
if we determine that the remaining useful life  based upon current events and circumstances  should be adjusted  the depreciation or amortization of the related asset is adjusted on a prospective basis 
intangible asset valuation our intangible assets  consisting primarily of goodwill of  as of december   represented the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
during the year ended december   our intangible assets were reduced by  to reflect impairment of the goodwill arising from our acquisition of foresight  inc in and were increased by  to reflect the goodwill arising from our acquisition of access and by  allocated to a contract acquired in the acquisition of access 
during the year ended december   our goodwill was decreased to reflect the recognition of an income tax benefit of  which relates to our merger acquisition of the capella group  inc during the year ended december   our goodwill was increased by  to adjust for deferred fees pertaining to the merger acquisition of the capella group  inc as of december   our intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
the intangible assets balance of  as of december  consisted of  which arose from the merger acquisition of the capella group  inc and  from the acquisition of access  as described above 
as of december   we conducted our annual goodwill impairment review 
our goodwill valuation is dependent primarily on the projected revenue and net earnings of our care entr e healthcare business  our foresight membership business and access healthcare business 
the company estimates the fair value of each of those reporting units  primarily on the basis of valuing projected revenue and net earnings using market comparables and compares it with the reporting unit s book value  which equals the recorded amounts of assets and allocated goodwill less liabilities 
when the fair value of those reporting units is greater than the reporting unit s book value  there is no impairment  and the test is complete 
otherwise  the company estimates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by repeating the process performed at acquisition 
this requires subtracting estimated current fair values of the unit s identifiable net assets from the unit s estimated fair value  and comparing the difference with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
when the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than carrying amount of the goodwill  the goodwill is not impaired and there is no write off 
when implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill  however  the company must record an impairment write off equal to the difference 
the procedures surrounding goodwill valuation can at times be very subjective and difficult to quantify given that the projected revenue and net earnings associated with our care entr e healthcare membership business is based on a business strategy that is fairly new  innovative and evolutionary in nature 
this is particularly difficult given the our recent history of decreasing revenues resulting from a more complex escrow based healthcare savings product  a frustrated independent marketing sales force  and increased expenses from  among other things  new compensatory sales initiatives produced an operating loss 
as stated above  in the first quarter of  we have undertaken measures and initiatives to improve our operating performance 
these measures and initiatives include i the integration of access management members with our management team  as mentioned above  ii the termination of certain equipment capital leases  iii other cost reduction actions  and iv exploration of additional products to compliment our core healthcare savings product and offer additional compensatory incentives to our independent marketing representatives 
we have incorporated the expected impact of those measures in our estimation of the projected revenue and net earnings associated with our care entr e healthcare membership business for purposes of that goodwill valuation analysis 
in the case of access more mature business  revenues and earnings are more stable  with generally a lower potential growth rate than our care entr e business  and therefore the goodwill impairment review process for that reporting unit is less difficult 
with respect to the  of goodwill associated with the foresight acquisition in  based upon the operating results of foresight in and projected revenues and earnings  we determined that the estimated fair value of foresight did not exceed the carrying value of the foresight tangible assets 
this impairment arose from the continuing decline in the revenues  and increases in the losses  in that subsidiary  as detailed in note segmented information to the financial statements included herein 
accordingly  a charge to earnings was recorded to reflect that  impairment of the foresight goodwill 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
we evaluate the probability of recognizing the benefit of deferred tax assets through the reduction of taxes otherwise payable in the future and the need to provide an allowance against the carrying amount of such deferred tax assets if it is more probable than not that some or all of those assets will not be realized
