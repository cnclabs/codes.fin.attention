we then proceed  on page  to discuss our results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   and for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  thereafter  beginning on page  we provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and discuss our capital requirements and financing activities in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
beginning on page  we discuss our critical accounting policies  the impact of inflation on our business and new accounting pronouncements 
overview maxwell technologies  inc is a delaware corporation originally incorporated in under the name maxwell laboratories  inc in  we changed our name to maxwell technologies  inc presently headquartered in san diego  california  we are a developer and manufacturer of innovative  cost effective energy storage and power delivery solutions 
maxwell operates as one business segment called high reliability  which has two manufacturing locations san diego  california and rossens  switzerland and is comprised of three product lines ultracapacitors our primary product  ultracapacitors  includes our boostcap ultracapacitor cells and multi cell modules and powercache backup power systems  which provide highly reliable power solutions for applications in consumer and industrial electronics  transportation and telecommunications 
high voltage capacitors our condis high voltage grading and coupling capacitors are used in electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electrical energy 
radiation mitigated microelectronic products our radiation mitigated microelectronic products include power modules  memory modules and single board computers for applications in the space and satellite industries 
we aim to design and manufacture our products to perform reliably for the life of the products and systems into which they are integrated 
we seek to achieve high reliability through the application of proprietary technologies and rigorously controlled design  development  manufacturing and test processes 
this high reliability strategy emphasizes the development and marketing of products that enable us to achieve higher profit margins than commodity electronic components and systems 
during the year ended december   we completed the discontinuance of our winding equipment product line segment  which was sold in december  with the shipment of the final product order that we were obligated to fulfill 
therefore  the financial statements for fiscal  and include the reclassification of the winding equipment product line segment to discontinued operations 

table of contents highlights we reported a net loss for fiscal of million  or per diluted share  versus a net loss of million  or per diluted share for fiscal the increased loss was primarily a result of the discontinuation of ultracapacitor sales for digital camera based product applications  reserves recorded against our small cell boostcap inventories and for ultracapacitor orders received that were priced below our production cost  costs incurred related to our compliance activities pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and various non recurring gains of approximately million recorded in during fiscal  we continued to focus on developing strategic alliances  introducing new products  and reducing product costs and operating expenses 
some of these efforts are described below we continued our efforts to commercialize our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in china through our manufacturing and marketing alliance with yeong long technologies  co  ltd 
yec  and we placed our first order for and farad cells for delivery in with yec 
this manufacturing alliance will provide maxwell with an additional low cost supply of ultracapacitors and help position us as a global supplier of ultracapacitors 
we introduced our new bcap d cell boostcap ultracapacitor  the first in a series of new ultracapacitors to be standardized on battery sizing to drive down costs and ease the integration of the technology 
by standardizing ultracapacitors  maxwell is reducing its manufacturing costs and passing savings directly to oems  as well as reducing time to market by supplying known form factors for seamless  rapid product integration 
we were selected to supply boostcap ultracapacitors for hybrid gasoline electric transit buses being built for a california transit facility 
this production level order resulted from the strategic alliance formed with ise corporation in we entered into a strategic alliance with hydrogenics corporation to collaborate on integrating maxwell s boostcap ultracapacitors into hydrogenics fuel cell power systems 
the alliance consists of a joint development program designed to accelerate ultracapacitor and fuel cell integration 
our boostcap ultracapacitor production facility in rossens  switzerland was certified to the rigorous  auto industry specific international organization for standardization iso ts standard  confirming the company s competence as an automotive supplier and commitment to organizational excellence 
this achievement is an important milestone in the company s goal of becoming a preferred ultracapacitor supplier for high volume automotive applications 
we have entered into a multi year strategic development and exclusive supply agreement with tantalus systems corporation to accelerate deployment of advanced meter reading and data management systems in the north american electric utility market 
tantalus will utilize boostcap ultracapacitors to power wireless transmitters for its utility network products 
the alliance highlights maxwell s product application diversity and will help position us to contribute to and profit from the advancing technology for electric  gas and water utility meters 
we have entered into a multi year strategic supply agreement with general hydrogen corporation to provide our boostcap ultracapacitors for use in fuel cell power systems for electric lift trucks and other applications 
fuel cell systems augmented by ultracapacitors have the potential to provide an efficient  lower maintenance alternative to conventional battery power for end users 
nasa s jet propulsion laboratory has independently verified the testing methodologies maxwell uses to demonstrate the fault tolerance of our scs super computer for space 
our product design uses a combination of proprietary packaging and radiation mitigated architecture to match the fault tolerance of competing products that use radiation hardened processors  thus providing an alternative that can potentially exceed the processing power of existing components 

table of contents our new production line for our condis high tension capacitors was completed  and the first qualification runs have been successful 
we expect this new factory concept to dramatically reduce our lead times and double our available output capacity 
in july  maxwell received the supplier of the year award from siemens power transmission distribution high voltage circuit breakers division 
this marks the first time that the division s insulation materials group has found one of their global suppliers to meet its stringent quality requirements 
the award represents another milestone in maxwell s ongoing multi disciplinary initiatives for organizational excellence 
we added additional form factors and configurations to our line of high performance  radiation hardened  synchronous dynamic random access memory sdram components for space applications  dramatically increasing the options for aerospace engineers requiring higher density memory to keep up with the escalating computing demands of space applications 
we were selected to supply boostcap ultracapacitors for fuel efficient  low emission  hybrid gasoline electric drive trains that ise corporation is building for buses purchased by the city of elk grove  california transit agency 
this is the second production level transit bus order that ise has won in  and the selection of maxwell s boostcap product reflects ultracapacitors growing acceptance as a standard energy storage and power delivery solution for the transportation industry 
we delivered two prototype scs single board computers to planning systems inc psi for evaluation as a fault tolerant computing platform in systems that psi is developing for the air force research laboratory s deployable structures experiment dsx space science mission 
the scs  which employs proprietary component shielding technology and novel system level architecture to mitigate radiation effects  has demonstrated error free performance in extensive testing that simulates environmental radiation encountered in space 
dsx is one of several space programs for which the scs is being evaluated 
we introduced two powercache ultracapacitor based backup power modules that provide a maintenance free  space saving alternative to batteries for short term bridge power in uninterruptible power supply ups systems for telecommunications  industrial and medical applications 
the modules allow mission critical facilities who rely on ups systems  such as wireless telecommunications base stations  data centers  automated factories and hospitals  to avoid downtime in the event of power interruptions 
we entered into a strategic supply agreement with enercon gmbh  a leading producer of wind turbines  through which enercon will source ultracapacitors exclusively from maxwell 
enercon s turbines employ an independent braking and pitch adjustment mechanism for each blade  with backup power to ensure continuous operation in the event of a power failure 
we delivered our first new cvt cvd product to a well known european high voltage instrumentation company during the first quarter of 
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
in the first quarter of  we recorded the final million payment in license fees received from yeong long technologies  inc yec in exchange for the right to manufacture our boostcap ultracapacitors in china

see discontinued operations below for a discussion of our disposition of the winding equipment business  which we acquired through our acquisition of montena 
restructuring restructuring charges were million for the year ended december  in  the restructuring charges were primarily attributable to restructuring of our i bus phoenix  inc business and our actions to position that business for sale 
in the first half of  i bus phoenix introduced new applied computing products that had been developed in however  the market for applied computing products  particularly in telecommunications  deteriorated throughout we responded to the poor market conditions for computing systems and other capital goods by restructuring i bus phoenix 
in june  we began implementing the restructuring plan and recorded restructuring charges of  in addition  we also determined that certain components in inventory had been adversely impacted 
accordingly  we recorded an inventory charge of approximately million for certain excess and obsolete raw material components and finished goods 
this charge was included in cost of sales 
during the third quarter of  we decided to sell the applied computing business of i bus phoenix to a new company organized by former i bus phoenix senior managers 
in preparation for the sale and to configure the i bus phoenix computing business to be self supporting  i bus phoenix consolidated all production of the applied computing products in its facility in tangmere  united kingdom  and reduced personnel worldwide 
as a result of these actions  we recorded additional restructuring charges of  during the quarter ended september  the unpaid restructuring balance of  at december  was paid in divestitures in december  we sold our former i bus manufacturing and administrative facility in san diego 
the facility was previously classified as assets held for sale at its book value of million

in september  purepulse suspended operations and we recorded non cash charges of approximately million and cash charges of approximately million for severance and other charges 
purepulse had been designing and developing systems that generate extremely intense  broad spectrum  pulsed light to purify water and inactivate viruses and other pathogens that contaminate vaccines and products sourced from human or animal tissues  such as plasma derivatives  transfusion blood components and biopharmaceuticals 
although purepulse raised million of equity capital from millipore and maxwell in march  the venture capital and other equity markets deteriorated after that time and purepulse was not able to raise additional capital to fund its operations 
in march  we sold our government systems business for million and recorded a gain of million  net of a million provision mainly related to ongoing lease obligations 
as of december  and  the remaining lease obligation  which expires in april  is  with a reserve provision of  and million with a reserve provision of  respectively

accordingly  no goodwill impairments were recognized for the years ended december  and goodwill impairments were million for the year ended december  amortization of other intangibles was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and relates to the amortization of developed core technology and customer backlog acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of montena and the amortization of ultracapacitor intellectual property that was recorded in conjunction with the merger of the electronic components group  a majority owned subsidiary  into maxwell after the purchase of all shares not already owned by us 
interest income  net was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we used proceeds from the sales of businesses and assets in to pay down debt and the excess was invested in high quality short term marketable investments 

table of contents an investment impairment of  was recorded in related to maxwell s ownership of approximately of a privately held company involved in support services in the areas of information technology  system and software integration and engineering and technical services under contract with various government agencies 
upon review of its annual financial statements and discussions with its chief financial officer  we were informed that the company had a negative net worth and had decided to restructure its operations to discontinue its information technology and software integration and engineering businesses and focus only on government contracting 
based on these facts and the uncertainty surrounding its ability to return to profitability  we concluded that the investment was impaired and we fully reserved for the investment 
we received  from the sale of the privately held company of which  had previously been recorded by us as investment 
in  we recovered  of the  recorded as impaired in and reflected the recovery as a gain loss on sale of business 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries was  for the year ended december  during  we acquired all of the outstanding minority interests  including stock options  of our majority owned subsidiaries  except for purepulse see discontinued operations above  in exchange for shares and options in maxwell 
fixed asset impairments were million for the year ended december  impairment charges recorded in were related to fixed assets associated with the i bus computing systems business that were abandoned  and computers and computer systems infrastructure directly related to supporting the i bus phoenix business 
the impairment also included fixed assets associated with transformer and harness production for the i bus phoenix power systems group 
production of transformers and harnesses subsequently was outsourced 
restatement of consolidated financial statements for the year ended december we have restated our consolidated financial statements to reflect adjustments to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as previously reported on form k 
the adjustments giving rise to our need to restate the financial statements for the year ended december  relate to the stock based compensation arising from our april repurchase of the remaining minority interests and merger of our i bus phoenix and electronic components group subsidiaries 
in connection with these transactions  we exchanged all outstanding vested and unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of these subsidiaries for options to acquire shares of maxwell 
as a result and as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  stock based compensation expense totaling approximately million was incurred in connection with the exchange of vested subsidiary stock options based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the respective merger date and the exercise price of the modified stock option 
we assessed the impact of this error on our historical financial statements and concluded that we were required to restate our financial statements 
as a result  the company restated its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   the principal effect of which was to increase net loss by approximately million 
the correction had no impact on net stockholders equity or cash flows used in continuing operations 
additional detail with respect to the impact of the restatement on our results of operations is reported in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flow for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the use of cash for the years ended december  and was primarily attributed to operating losses from continuing operations 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
in  cash of million was used in the company s third quarter as part of the purchase price for montena 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  which is approximately equal to our annual depreciation and amortization charges 
our restructuring plan that started in was completed in early  and we started realizing the benefit of our restructuring effort during all indicators such as productivity  lower production cost and new product introductions have increased 
the reduction of overhead and increased productivity should continue to improve our gross margins and reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in in february  we secured a million line of credit from a us bank  which was renewed in march  that is available for working capital needs limited by the amount of eligible assets  the line has not been used to date 
we also have a line of credit for approximately million from a swiss bank for working capital in switzerland 
the line was fully used as of december  and we also have approximately a million term loan available from a swiss bank for capital equipment purchases  all of which was used as of december  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments at the end of december we have a shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission 
we raised approximately million in november from the sale of shares of common stock that were registered pursuant to the shelf registration statement 
approximately million of the shelf registration statement remains available to us for raising capital 
we believe the liquidity provided by the existing cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities  borrowings available under our lines of credit and availability on form s  will provide sufficient capital to fund our capital equipment and working capital requirements and potential operating losses for more than the next months 
failure to achieve expected cash flows from operating activities or to obtain additional debt or equity investments  if necessary and if available  would have a material adverse effect on us 
net accounts receivable increased to million as of december  from million at december  the primary reasons for the increase was due to longer credit terms to larger customers and slow payment from one large customer 
net inventory balance increased to million as of december  from million as of december this increase is due to an increase in the ultracapacitor business 
inventory reserves as of december   were million compared with million as of december  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of december  were million compared with million as of december  the primary reason for the reduction was a decrease in sg a expenses

critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as us gaap 
we have used certain assumptions and judgments in the preparation of these financial statements  which assumptions and estimates may potentially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and  as such  management assumptions and conclusions in these areas may significantly impact the results of operations of the company 
revenue recognition for the fiscal year ended december   substantially all of our revenue was derived from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers and licensing fees received for the right to manufacture our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors 
product revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped and title passes to the customer unless specific terms require otherwise 
in general no discounts are offered and there 
table of contents is no right of return 
license fee revenues are recognized when the performance requirements have been met  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of fees is probable 
in prior years  certain continuing and discontinued segments involved revenues from both long term and short term fixed price contracts and cost plus contracts with the us government directly or through a prime contractor 
those revenues  including estimated profits  were recognized at the time the costs were incurred and included provisions for any anticipated losses 
these contracts are subject to rate audits and other audits  which could result in the reduction of revenue in excess of estimated provisions 
in turn  this could increase losses for the periods in which any such reduction occurs 
production costs in anticipation of an increase in our production capacity  expected efficiencies from economies of scale  and a new production line expected to reduce future costs  we have accepted ultracapacitor orders that were priced below our current production costs 
these orders are scheduled for shipments at various times through the third quarter of we have estimated production costs for each quarter of in order to determine the estimated loss to fulfill these commitments at december  these estimates include taking into account the installation  commencing in early  of a new ultracapacitor production line in our facility located in rossens  switzerland 
the new production line will create production efficiencies  thereby reducing production costs 
production efficiencies will be gained as each process of the line is implemented and as production volume increases 
actual production costs during may differ from our estimates of these efficiencies and could result in an adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounts receivable we establish and maintain customer credit limits based on references  financial information  credit worthiness and payment history 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect anticipated bad debts based on past collection history and any specific risks identified in the portfolio 
we determine our bad debt reserve based on an analysis we make to measure our reserve requirements and we establish specific reserves when we recognize the inability of our customer to pay its obligation 
if we become aware of increasing negative changes in the financial condition of our customers  or if economic conditions change adversely  we may have to increase the allowance 
an increase in such allowances would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
remaining lease obligation from discontinued operations we have provided an estimate of the liability of purepulse associated with a remaining lease obligation  which has been recorded in discontinued operations 
in making this estimate  we considered factors such as the commercial real estate market  including our estimate as to how and when we will be able to sub lease  terminate or buy out the remaining lease obligation 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to conclude this lease obligation for the amount that we have accrued  which could require additional charges 
excess and obsolete inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with current and committed inventory levels 
the markets for the company s products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
in addition  price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
we have recorded significant charges for reserves in recent periods to reflect changes in market conditions 
we believe that future events are subject to change and revisions in estimates may have a significant adverse impact on the balance sheet and statement of operations 
long lived assets and other intangible assets long lived assets such as property and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events and changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset 
table of contents may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis of impairment involve estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
we use cash flow assumptions that are consistent with our business plans and consider other relevant information 
if we determine that the carrying value of the long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable  a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds its fair market value 
if there are changes in business circumstances or in the key assumptions used in estimating undiscounted cash flows  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the reporting units  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value  which was calculated in step one 
the impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of their goodwill 
we have determined the fair value of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts 
in assessing the implied fair value of goodwill  we have made assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows and other operating factors 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis of impairment involve estimates of revenue and expense forecasts of the reporting unit 
if there are changes in business circumstances or in the key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
we cannot say with certainty that we may not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the fair value of maxwell technologies and maxwell sa decrease due to market conditions  revisions in our assumptions or other unanticipated circumstances 
any additional impairment charges will adversely affect our results of operations 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have had a recent history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof as to their ability to generate sufficient future income in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we determined that it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance as of december  against our deferred tax assets based on the recent history of losses to amounts that are expected to be more likely than not realizable 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of a tax benefit and a reduction to the company s effective tax rate 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for any of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of 
table of contents employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values and does not allow the previously permitted pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r is scheduled to be effective beginning in the third quarter of fiscal sfas r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retroactive recognition  which may date back to the original issuance of sfas or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating these transition methods 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because that will depend on the method of adoption elected  the fair value and number of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and pro forma loss per share in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  requiring companies to treat idle facility costs  abnormal handling costs  freight and wasted materials as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory costs 
the effective date is annual periods beginning after june  the company has evaluated sfas and management believes it will not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we have not entered into or invested in any instruments that are subject to market risk  except as follows foreign currency risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in switzerland 
maxwell technologies sa has euro and local currency swiss franc revenue and local currency operating expenses and loans 
changes in these currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue  expenses and debt 
we do not hedge our currency exposures 
interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million or million swiss franc denominated debt  of which  is classified as long term debt 
the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturity dates of these instruments 
we do not anticipate significant interest rate swings in the near future  however  the exchange loss or gain may affect the consolidated balance sheet or the statement of operations 
a increase in the interest rate on our debt would not have a material effect on our related interest expense 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  high quality corporate issuers and money market accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
current policies do not allow the use of interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   third parties manage approximately million of the investment portfolio under guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the balance of our cash is invested in money market accounts with banks 
a increase in the interest rate on our marketable securities would not have a material effect on our interest income
