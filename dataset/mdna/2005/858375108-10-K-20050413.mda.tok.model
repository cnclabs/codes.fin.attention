currently with locations from california to new york  stein mart s focused assortment of merchandise features moderate to designer brand name apparel for women  men and children  as well as accessories  gifts  linens and shoes

the company faces competition for customers and for access to quality merchandise from better department stores  fine specialty stores and  to a lesser degree  from off price retail chains 
many of these competitors are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the retail apparel industry is highly fragmented and competitive  and the off price retail business may become even more competitive in the future 
stein mart s accomplishments during include o increased total sales by percent overall and comparable store sales by percent o improved net income to per share compared to per share in o improved gross profit as a percentage of sales by percent o improved selling  general and administrative expenses by percent o improved sales per store including leased departments from million to million o opened seven new locations during the year which produced million in sales by year end  relocated two stores to more advantageous locations and closed seven under performing stores o reduced average store inventories by percent o reduced inventory shrinkage for a pre tax benefit of million o eliminated borrowings and ended the year with more than million in cash and short term investments outlook over the past three years  the company has reduced inventory levels  re formatted its stores  closed a number of unprofitable locations  eliminated full price coupons and created a new marketing campaign 
as such  the company s preliminary outlook for is as follows o increase sales at a more modest rate  yet producing substantial profit growth due to better inventory productivity o improve gross margin as a result of fewer markdowns on less inventory as well as a larger percentage of current merchandise o strengthen the store network with a plan to open new stores  including one relocation  and close eight under performing locations o continue strong cash position with no debt  expected capital expenditures of approximately million and a return to repurchasing shares of company stock

gross profit for the year ended january  was million or percent of net sales  a percentage point increase over gross profit of million or percent of net sales for the year ended january  the increase was due to a percentage point increase in mark up  a percentage point improvement in occupancy leverage as a result of higher per store sales productivity this year compared to last year and a percentage point improvement in shrinkage  partially offset by a percentage point increase in markdowns 
continued improvements in the loss prevention organization and its system enhancements contributed to the shrinkage improvement

included in sg a expenses for fiscal and are store closing and asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
charges were higher in primarily because ongoing lease obligations were recorded for several of the stores excluding discontinued operations closed during while the six stores excluding discontinued operations closed in had minimal lease termination and severance costs 
pre opening expenses for the seven stores opened in amounted to million and for the stores opened in  amounted to million

in recent years  as a marketing vehicle to attract new customers  the company used various coupons that allowed customers to take a specified percentage discount off of full priced merchandise 
as this practice escalated  it became apparent that these coupons did not support the company s unique selling proposition 
as a result  the company discontinued these percentage off full price coupons in july while such coupons may continue to be used on a limited basis in new markets and specific circumstances  the widespread distribution of full price  percentage off coupons has ceased 
as anticipated  the discontinuation of these customer traffic incentives hindered sales growth 
however  discounts that had previously been devoted to these coupon incentives were used to clear seasonal goods more efficiently and create additional freshness in the inventory 
gross profit for the year ended january  was million or percent of net sales  a percentage point increase over gross profit of million or percent of net sales for the year ended february  mark up improved percentage points over last year  but was offset by a percentage point increase in markdowns and a percentage point increase due to lack of occupancy leverage

the increase in these charges accounted for approximately one third of the percentage point increase in sg a expenses as a percent of sales 
sg a expenses increased percent of net sales due to an increase in expenses related to the new advertising campaign and the remaining increase is due to a lack of leverage resulting from the decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal year pre opening expenses for the stores opened in amounted to million and for the stores opened in  amounted to million 
income from operations was million or percent of net sales for and million or percent of net sales for the decrease in income from continuing operations is due to the overall reduction in net sales  as well as increased operating losses from the stores closed in and and other changes discussed above 
other income  primarily from in store leased shoe departments  was million in  a slight decrease from the million in  but remained at of sales 
an improvement in the shoe business was offset by the elimination of fragrance as a leased department in may interest expense for was million  compared to million in the decrease resulted from lower average borrowings at lower interest rates this year compared to last year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds  a revolving credit facility and credit terms from vendors 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  the company s working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest in either the third or fourth quarter in anticipation of the fourth quarter peak selling season 
as of january   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in the increase in is primarily attributable to an increase in net income including non cash items  increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable  and a decrease in inventories 
accounts payable increased while total inventories decreased from the prior year end reflecting more current purchases and improved turnover of inventories 
on an average store basis  inventories were reduced from the prior year due to increased sales resulting from the company s continued focus on marketing  sales promotion and clearance strategies 
cash used in investing activities was million in and million in the additional cash provided by operations enabled the company to invest in short term investments during capital expenditures  primarily for the acquisition of store fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements and information system enhancements  were million and million for and  respectively 
capital expenditures were higher in compared to due to enhancements to the point of sale and merchandising systems and remodeling costs for several existing stores 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million in the company eliminated borrowings under its revolving credit agreement during the first quarter during  cash was used to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock for million 
as of january   there are  shares which can be repurchased pursuant to the board of directors current authorizations 
the company plans to open new stores in the cost of opening a typical new store generally ranges from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately million 
the company s total capital expenditures for including amounts budgeted for new store expansion  improvements to existing stores and information system enhancements are anticipated to be approximately million 
the company has a revolving credit agreement with a group of lenders  with an initial term ending july the agreement  which was completed in july  provides a million senior revolving credit facility 
borrowings are based on and secured by eligible inventory and certain other assets 
at january  there were no direct borrowings under the credit facility and no event of default existed under the terms of the agreement 
at january   outstanding borrowings were million 
the interest rates on borrowings under the agreement range from prime to prime plus 
per annum for prime rate loans and libor plus to libor plus per annum for eurodollar rate loans and are established quarterly  based on excess availability as defined in the agreement 
an unused line fee of 
to 
per annum 
as of january  is charged on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility  based on excess availability 
the company believes that expected net cash provided by operating activities and unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund anticipated current and long term capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
should current operating conditions deteriorate  management can borrow on the revolving credit agreement or adjust operating plans  including new store rollout 
contractual obligations to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations  the following payments due by period data is provided less than after total year years years years operating leases      at january   the company had no direct borrowings on its credit facility 
other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include deferred income taxes  deferred compensation and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at january  if certain conditions occurred under these arrangements  the company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  the company does not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect the financial condition of the company 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature with a higher percentage of the company s merchandise sales and earnings generated in the fall and holiday selling seasons 
accordingly  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percent of net sales during the first three quarters of each year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the assets over its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets 
store closing costs the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to record store closing costs 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
insurance reserve estimates the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
the company is responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of the company s merchandise is recognized at the time of sale  net of any returns and allowances  discounts and percentage off coupons 
future merchandise returns are estimated based on historical experience 
leased department sales are excluded from net sales  commissions  net of related selling expenses  and rental income from leased departments are included in other income  net 
operating leases the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
certain lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term and records the difference between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent liability 
the landlord lessor constructs the building leasehold improvements for the majority of the company s stores 
for other store operating leases which require the company lessee to construct the building leasehold improvements  these assets are considered to be landlord assets and the company records the cost of these leasehold improvements in excess of any landlord construction allowance received as prepaid rent which is amortized to rent expense over the lease term
