and international business machines corporation  to electronic manufacturing services  or ems  providers such as foxconn electronics  inc and flextronics international ltd  and to display manufacturers such as hosiden fd corporation and optrex corporation japan 
in  we acquired the assets of an optical and photonic imaging solution company as part of our strategy to capture a substantial portion of the expanding camera cell phone market 
we now operate this business as aurora optical  inc  or aurora optical  as a wholly owned subsidiary of m flex 
we also entered into development and manufacturing agreements with mobility electronics  inc  or mobility  in  aimed at utilizing our component assembly capabilities and embedded magnetic technology in mobility s charger products 
we were incorporated as multi fineline electronix  inc in california in october in connection with our initial public offering  we reincorporated as multi fineline electronix  inc in delaware on june  references in this annual report to we  our  us and m flex refer to multi fineline electronix  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries  multi fineline electronix suzhou co  ltd  or mfc  multi fineline electronix suzhou no 
co  ltd  or mfc  and aurora optical  except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent company 
industry background we believe that the global market for flexible printed circuits will continue to grow over the coming years as consumers continue to demand smaller  more functional devices 
given inherent design and cost advantages of flexible printed circuits  they quickly are becoming a favored solution for electronics manufacturers who are striving to increase the features and functionality of electronic devices while reducing the size  shape and weight of such devices 
asia is the largest and fastest growing market for flexible printed circuits  largely because of two trends that occurred in the early s the 
table of contents outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shifting of manufacturing facilities from the united states to asian countries 
historically  electronics manufacturers have relied upon rigid printed circuit boards to provide the electrical interconnections between the components in electronics devices 
rigid printed circuit boards consist of a board that contains multiple transistors  microprocessors and other components that are connected by copper wires embedded on the circuit board 
given that the rigid printed circuit boards cannot bend or twist  they inherently limit the design options available to engineers 
for example  in order to design and build flip phone style mobile phones  engineers had to create a method to connect the rigid printed circuit board in the base of the phone with the rigid printed circuit board in the screen 
copper wires could not be used because they are subject to failure as a result of stress from the constant bending and flexing of the wires  therefore  design engineers had to look to new materials to provide a means of electrical interconnection between the various components of the device 
to address this need  companies such as m flex began to design flexible printed circuits and flexible printed circuits containing components  or component assemblies  to serve as electrical interconnections 
these flexible printed circuits can twist  bend and flex in a device with less risk of failure while connecting the components of the device 
in addition to these functionality advantages  flexible printed circuits and component assemblies enable oems  ems providers and display manufacturers to design and construct modular components that can be incorporated into the final product  which in turn reduces the complexity of the assembly of the final product  reduces the manufacturing costs and facilitates human interaction with the electronic device 
as a result  manufacturers can reduce the number of assembly operations required for a product and improve the efficiency of their supply chains 
we believe that the overall market for flexible printed circuits and component assemblies is poised for substantial growth over the next several years as a result of favorable technological and market developments  including miniaturization  portability and complexity of electronic devices 
as electronic devices become more powerful  complex and compact  product size becomes a principal design limitation 
from an engineering standpoint  flexible printed circuits possess enhanced heat dissipation properties because they are thinner than rigid printed circuit boards and provide higher signal integrity interconnection 
they also enable faster operating speeds because the components can be placed closer together and can serve as a medium for analog and digital devices 
as a result  the electronics industry has relied increasingly upon flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
for example  the placement of chips and liquid crystal displays directly on the flexible printed circuit enables oems to increase functionality and improve packaging characteristics while managing time to market for their products in an overall cost effective manner 
moreover  as electronics companies develop increased functionality for semiconductors  the traditional packaging and mounting technologies are becoming obsolete 
for example  designs of electronics devices that incorporate camera modules require the performance and flexibility characteristics offered by flexible printed circuits 
outsourcing 
electronics companies increasingly are relying upon outsourcing to technically qualified  strategically located manufacturing partners that provide integrated  end to end flexible printed circuit and component assembly solutions comprised of design and application engineering  prototyping and competitive high volume production services 
by employing these end to end manufacturers  electronics companies are able to reduce time to market  avoid product delays  reduce manufacturing costs  minimize logistical problems and focus on their core competencies 
expanding markets and flexible component demand 
the global demand for wireless communication products and the complexity of wireless devices  including those supporting products with digital cameras and personal digital assistants  increasingly are driving the demand for more complex flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
electronics companies have discovered that they can increase the functionality of flexible printed circuits and reduce the number of required interconnects by mounting components  such as connectors  switches  resistors  capacitors  light emitting devices  integrated circuits and optical sensors  to the flexible printed circuits 
while we believe that the wireless telecommunications industry in general is expanding rapidly  we believe that the number of flexible printed circuits and component assemblies incorporated into these wireless devices will grow even more rapidly  requiring significantly more flexible components per device than have been used in previous generation wireless applications 
competitive strengths we are a leading global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuit and component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we believe our competitive strengths include our seamless and efficient end to end solution for flexible printed circuit applications 
we provide a seamless  integrated end to end flexible printed circuit solution for our customers  ranging from design and application engineering  prototyping and high volume manufacturing to turnkey component assembly and testing 
by relying on a single provider for their flexible printed circuit requirements  our customers can benefit from opportunities for more robust product designs and process optimization during the development phase 
this  in turn  frequently leads to production cost savings and quicker time to market 
our operations in the united states and china each possess the expertise and capabilities to provide a seamless  integrated end to end solution that provides our customers with the ability to leverage any one or more of our facilities to meet their global requirements 

table of contents our design and application engineering expertise supports our strong customer relationships 
our expertise in designing and manufacturing flexible printed circuits and component assemblies has enabled us to become a partner to our customers at the earliest stages of product development 
we employ our design and application engineers as part of our sales process  therefore  our customers rely on us to assist them in the early design phase of their products 
early design participation enables us to gain intricate knowledge of our customers products and thereby provide value added engineering support to them 
early design participation also enables our customers to achieve lower production costs through better product design and utilization of our flexible printed circuit assembly expertise 
in addition  this process fosters strong relationships with our customers  often resulting in their reliance on our products and engineering support for the life of the specific application and subsequent generations of similar applications 
we believe these strong customer relationships with leading oems represent entry barriers for our competitors 
our manufacturing capabilities 
we maintain manufacturing facilities in the united states and china 
our us operations provide design and application engineering and manufacturing  while our chinese operations are organized to duplicate the processes and tooling designed in the united states for automation  while allowing us to consolidate the labor intensive aspects of high volume manufacturing in a cost efficient environment 
we also are continuing to enhance our design and application engineering capabilities in china to best position us to provide an integrated end to end solution to the emerging domestic electronics markets in china and other parts of asia 
since  we have expanded our manufacturing capacity in china by acquiring additional and technologically advanced machinery  and by expanding our manufacturing facilities 
our ongoing attention to integrating the manufacturing processes between our facilities allows us to improve our product yields  shorten our customers supply chains and lower the overall costs of our products 
furthermore  expansion of our manufacturing facilities and the capital equipment addition at our second manufacturing facility in china  or mfc  which we expect to be completed in october  will increase substantially our manufacturing capacities in china and enable us to take on additional high volume manufacturing programs 
while we believe our chinese manufacturing facilities benefit the company  they do subject us to additional risks inherent in international business  including those detailed under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future operating results 
our forward integration in the value chain 
we have implemented a strategy of upward integration focusing on the value added services that we provide to our customers design and application engineering and component assembly rather than only concentrating on acquiring the capabilities to produce the materials used to manufacture flexible printed circuits 
by employing suppliers to provide us with raw materials  we have avoided unnecessary capital equipment and research and development costs and have focused more intensely on the integral steps in the manufacturing process  from design and prototyping to high volume manufacturing and component assembly 
the result of this strategy has been superior design and application engineering expertise  strong customer relationships and yearly sequential net sales growth 
our management experience and expertise 
all of our executive officers have been with us for between and years 
during that time  our executive management has made a number of critical  strategic decisions that successfully managed our growth and profitability  including pursuing a strategy of deploying our design and application engineers at the early stages of a customer s product designs  responding to the trend of oem outsourcing  identifying china s manufacturing capabilities  creating a seamless  integrated end to end solution in each of our us and chinese operations to serve the needs of multinational oems  ems providers and display manufacturers  and adopting a forward integration strategy in order to focus on the engineering and assembly needs of our customers 
business strategy our objective is to continue to expand our product offering to become a global provider of electronic products packaging technology and manufacturing by using our core technologies of high quality  technologically advanced flexible 
table of contents printed circuits and assemblies as the essential ingredients

we intend to maintain our leadership in providing a complete end to end solution to our customers that includes design and application engineering  prototyping  high volume manufacturing  material acquisition  component assembly and testing 
in addition  we intend to leverage our value added services design and application engineering and turnkey component assembly to help solve our customers product design challenges and to provide our customers with flexible printed circuit solutions designed and manufactured to maximize the reliability and functionality of their end products 
by focusing on customers product applications and providing them with a seamless  integrated and cost efficient flexible printed circuit and component assembly solution  we believe that we can continue to grow our market share by eliminating the need of our customers to negotiate with multiple vendors and reducing the time to market for their products 
support the development of applications for flexible printed circuit technology in new markets 
we believe that flexible printed circuit technology provides a cost effective solution to improving the functionality and packaging of electronic devices 
we believe that the trend towards miniaturization will continue to drive the growth of flexible printed circuits in many industries that we currently do not serve 
to address these new market opportunities  we will continue our efforts to research  develop and market new applications for flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
we believe that our design and application engineering and manufacturing capabilities  coupled with our flexible printed circuit assembly expertise  will enable us to effectively target additional high volume flexible printed circuit applications in various markets of the electronics industry  including the camera cell phone and charger markets  where size  shape and weight are primary drivers of product development 
expand our existing expertise in the design and manufacture of flexible printed circuit technology 
by expanding our market share in existing markets  penetrating new markets and partnering with customers in the early stage design of their products  we will continue to expand our engineering and manufacturing expertise and capabilities for applications and functionality for electronic product packaging technology and assist our customers in developing more efficient manufacturing processes for their products 
we believe that we will be able to continue to capture additional market share in the sectors we serve and attract companies from other markets of the electronics industry by utilizing our expertise in design and application engineering to expand product designs and applications for flexible printed circuit solutions in conjunction with our high volume  cost effective manufacturing capabilities 
diversify our end customers 
we primarily serve the wireless telecommunications sector 
we plan to leverage our internal sales force comprised entirely of design and application engineers with our existing outside non exclusive sales representatives to attract new customers in the wireless telecommunications sector  as well as in other sectors of the electronics industry where functionality and packaging size dictate the need for flexible printed circuits and component assemblies  including markets where embedded magnetic applications are used  such as in chargers  and in the medical market 
increase manufacturing capacity and capabilities 
we intend to continue to improve our manufacturing capabilities and cost reduction efforts through increased integration of our engineering and manufacturing facilities in the united states and china 
when our new facility expansion at mfc is complete  we will increase substantially our manufacturing capacity 
in addition  mfc has been specifically designed and equipped for fine line programs  which are flexible printed circuits with smaller features  and a high density of components and interconnection 
fine line programming allows us to offer our customers an efficient  technologically advanced manufacturing process for complex flexible printed circuit fabrication 

table of contents products our design and application engineering expertise enable us to offer flexible printed circuit and value added component assembly solutions for a wide range of electronic applications 
we offer products in a broad range of markets  including mobile phones  smart mobile devices  portable bar code scanners  personal digital assistants  data storage devices  power supplies and consumable medical sensors 
representative oem customers and their end products that incorporate our flexible printed circuit products include the following oem customer product category representative application motorola  inc mobile phone and smart mobile devices keypad  camera  hinge and display flexible printed circuit component assemblies symbol technologies inc bar code scanners rotating scanner flexible printed circuit component assemblies palmone  inc personal digital assistants communicator flexible printed circuit component assemblies international business machines corporation computer storage flexible printed circuit in data storage device ge healthcare medical applications flexible printed circuit in diagnostic equipment masimo corporation blood oxygen sensor disposable flexible printed circuit contained in bandage flexible printed circuits 
flexible printed circuits  which consist of copper conductive patterns that have been etched or printed while affixed to flexible substrate materials such as polyimide or polyester  are used to provide connections between electronic components and as a substrate to support these electronic devices 
the circuits are manufactured by subjecting the base materials to multiple processes  such as drilling  screening  photo imaging  etching  plating and finishing 
we produce a wide range of flexible printed circuits  including single sided  double sided  multi layer with and without gaps between layers and rigid flex 
single sided flexible printed circuits  which have an etched conductive pattern on one side of the substrate  are normally less costly and more flexible than double sided flexible printed circuits because their construction consists of a single patterned conductor layer 
double sided flexible printed circuits  which have conductive patterns or materials on both sides of the substrate that are interconnected by a drilled or copper plated hole  can provide either more functionality than a single sided flexible printed circuit by containing conductive patterns on both sides  or greater shielding of components against electromagnetic interference than a single sided flexible printed circuit by covering one side of the circuit with a shielding material rather than a circuit pattern 
multi layer and rigid flex printed circuits  which consist of layers of circuitry that are stacked and then laminated  are used where the complexity of the design demands multiple layers of flexible printed circuitry 
if some of the layers of circuitry are rigid printed circuit material  the product is known as a rigid flex printed circuit 
gapped flexible printed circuits  which consist of layers of circuitry that are stacked and separated in some parts of the circuit  and laminated in other parts of the circuit  are used where the complexity of the design demands multiple layers of flexible printed circuitry but the flexibility of a single sided flexible printed circuit in some parts of the circuit 
flexible printed circuit assemblies 
flexible printed circuits can be enhanced by attaching electronic components  such as connectors  switches  resistors  capacitors  light emitting devices  integrated circuits  cameras and optical sensors  to the circuit 
the reliability of flexible printed circuit component assemblies is dependent upon proper assembly design and the use of appropriate fixtures to protect the flex to connector interface 
connector selection is also important in determining the signal integrity of the overall assembly a factor which is very important to devices that rely upon high system speed to function properly 
we are one of the pioneers in attaching connectors and components to flexible printed circuits and have developed the expertise and technology to mount a full range of electronic devices  from passive components to computing devices 
customers our customers include leading oems  ems providers and display manufacturers in a variety of sectors of the electronics industry 
these sectors include mobile phones  smart mobile devices  portable bar code scanners  personal digital assistants  data storage devices  power supplies and consumable medical sensors 
our expertise in flexible printed circuit 
table of contents design and component assembly enables us to assist our customers in resolving their design challenges through our design and assembly techniques  which frequently results in the customer placing our product designs on the customers design specifications and enhances our likelihood of becoming the main provider for flexible printed circuits and component assembly included in that product 
achieving status as a main provider to an oem for a high volume program enables us to build strong customer relationships with respect to existing products and any future product that requires the use of flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
we generally work with oems in the design of their products  and the oems subsequently either purchase our products directly or instruct the ems providers and display manufacturers to purchase our products to be incorporated into the oem s product 
ems providers that we sell to include foxconn and flextronics 
our relationships with ems providers and display manufacturers normally are directed by the oems  therefore  it is typically the oems that negotiate product pricing and volumes directly with us  even though the purchase orders come from the ems providers and display manufacturers 
for the past several years  motorola and its subcontractors have been our largest customers 
in the fiscal years ended september   and  we sold products to be incorporated into motorola s products to  and motorola subcontractors  which aggregated  and of our net sales including direct sales to motorola 
our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in demand for our product 
historically  we have experienced a strong first fiscal quarter  followed by reduced net sales in the second fiscal quarter  as a result of partial seasonality of our major customers and the markets that we serve 
our major customers provide consumer related products that generally experience their highest sales activity during the calendar year end holiday season  therefore  we typically experience a decline in our second fiscal quarter sales as this holiday period ends 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales is likely to continue 
as a result  our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
our facilities in the united states and china enable us to manufacture products for shipment anywhere in the world 
for the fiscal year ended september   we derived of our net sales in the united states and of our net sales outside the united states

for the fiscal years ended september   and  we had long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively  in the united states  and million  million and million  respectively  in china 
sales and marketing we sell our products primarily through our in house design and application engineers  who meet regularly with our customers and potential customers to assist in the initial design of the proposed products and to provide suggestions on how our flexible printed circuit solutions can enhance product design 
by utilizing market and product teams in each sector of the electronics industry that we target  we have successfully expanded our market penetration by leveraging our design and application engineers within each of these teams 
in particular  these engineers apply the principal of concurrent engineering to our customers engineers in the early phases of the product development cycle 
we engage the services of non exclusive sales representatives to interact with customers and potential customers on our behalf 
fifteen of these sales representatives are located throughout the united states 
we also have one sales representative in each of canada  europe  korea and taiwan 
we rely on these sales representatives to initiate contact with potential customers and provide leads to our internal sales and marketing teams  as well as to create  build and maintain our customer relationships and assist in the resolution of contractual disputes 
as of september   our backlog  which constitutes customer orders placed with us that we believe to be firm but that have not yet shipped  was million 
we expect to ship this entire backlog during fiscal year we cannot guarantee that our customers will not cancel any or all of the orders in our backlog 
our current backlog also is not indicative

technology we are a global provider of single  double sided  multi layer and gapped flexible printed circuit technology and component assemblies 
our process technology includes proprietary processes and chemical recipes  which coupled with our design expertise  unique customized fixtures and tooling and manufacturing experience  enables us to deliver high unit volumes of complex flexible printed circuits and component assemblies at cost effective yields 
design technology 
the flexible printed circuits we manufacture are designed specifically for each application  frequently requiring significant joint design activities with the customer at the start of a project 
we have developed design methodologies that solve difficult interconnection problems and save our customers time and money 
we design and mass produce flexible printed circuits that range from single sided circuits to more complex double sided  multi layer with and without gaps between layers and rigid flex 
we continually are investing in and improving our computer based design tools to more quickly design new flexible printed circuits  enhance cooperative design and communication with our customers and more closely integrate design and application engineering to our prototyping and manufacturing process 
circuit fabrication technology 
we have extensive experience producing fine line flexible printed circuits and have developed manufacturing processes that are designed to deliver high unit volumes at cost effective yields 
in the flexible printed circuit industry  fine line flexible printed circuits are easier to construct as the thickness of the copper decreases  however  as the thickness of the copper decreases  the cost of fabrication increases 
we have developed a manufacturing process to pattern plate in selective regions of the circuitry pattern  such as around the holes used to connect the two sides of a double sided flexible printed circuit 
in addition  the normal manufacturing technology  by itself  has been improved with new equipment which enables thicker  less expensive copper to be etched down precisely enough to form fine line circuitry 
the combination of these two processes allows us to achieve finer patterns without a substantial increase in costs and with acceptable yields 
in addition to fine line techniques  we have developed a proprietary process using ultraviolet lasers to drill inch diameter holes  known as micro vias  for the connection of circuits on the reverse side of the substrate 
the combination of the fine lines and micro vias are part of the new high density interconnect technology that is one of our primary engineering competitive strengths 
component assembly and test technology 
our component assembly and test technology involve the arrangement of the circuits on a panel to minimize material waste and facilitate requirements for component assembly  such as placing tooling holes  optical locators for vision based machines  test points and pre cut zones to allow part removal without compromising the integrity of the components 
we assemble passive electrical and various mechanical components  including capacitors  resistors  integrated circuits  connectors  stiffeners  diodes and other devices to flexible printed circuits 
we also perform advanced assembly of integrated circuit devices  as well as the functional testing of these flexible printed circuit component assemblies 
assembling these components directly onto the flexible printed circuit increases performance and reduces space  weight and cost 
intellectual property our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
our intellectual property relates to proprietary processes and know how covering methods of designing and manufacturing flexible printed circuits  attaching components and embedded magnetics for chargers 
we regularly require our employees to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment of invention agreements to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  we consider filing patents on our inventions that are significant to our business  although none of our existing patents or patent applications pertain to inventions that are significant to our current business 
we also pursue trademarks where applicable and necessary 
in the future  we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
we believe that our design and manufacturing processes do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party  however  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute 
suppliers we purchase raw circuit materials  process chemicals and various components from a limited number of outside sources  including ei dupont de nemours co  rogers corporation  molex inc  supertex  inc and itt  inc 
for 
table of contents components  we normally make short term purchasing commitments to key suppliers for specific customer programs 
these commitments are usually made for three to month periods 
these suppliers agree to cooperate with us in engineering activities  as required  and in some cases maintain a local inventory to provide shorter lead times and reduced inventory levels for us 
in most cases  suppliers are approved and often dictated by our customers 
for process chemicals  certain copper and polyimide laminate materials and certain specialty chemicals used in our manufacturing process  we rely on a limited number of key suppliers 
alternate chemical products are available from other sources  but process chemical changes often require approval by our customers and requalification of the processes  which could take weeks or months to complete 
we seek to mitigate these risks by identifying stable companies with leading technology and delivery capabilities and by attempting to qualify at least two suppliers for all critical raw materials and components 
competition the flexible printed circuit market is competitive  with a variety of large and small companies offering design and manufacturing services 
the flexible printed circuit market is differentiated by customers  applications and geography  with each niche requiring specific combinations of complex packaging and interconnection 
we believe that our ability to offer an integrated  end to end flexible printed circuit solution has enabled us to compete favorably with respect to design capabilities  product performance  reliability and consistency  price  customer support and application support  and resources  equipment and expertise in component assembly on flexible printed circuits 
we compete on a global level with a number of leading japanese providers  such as nippon mektron  nitto denko corporation and fujikura ltd  as well as a growing number of flexible printed circuit assembly producers in taiwan  south korea and china  and with domestic providers 
we are aware of at least companies in asia with which we compete  and we expect others to enter the market in this region because of government subsidies and lower labor rates available there 
we also compete with mfs technology ltd  or mfs  which is a subsidiary of wbl corporation limited  or wbl corporation  located in singapore 
wbl corporation beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock as of september  we believe that our technology leadership and capabilities in designing and manufacturing flexible printed circuits and component assemblies have enabled us to build strong partnerships and customer relationships with many companies 
we believe that customers typically rely upon a limited number of vendors designs for the life of specific applications and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of similar applications 
accordingly  it is difficult to achieve significant sales to a particular customer for any application once a different vendor has been selected to design and manufacture a specific flexible printed circuit 
this market paradigm may provide a barrier to our competitors in the markets in which we compete  however  it may also present an obstacle to our entry into other markets 
any expansion of existing products or services could expose us to new competition 
employees as of october   we employed approximately  full time employees and contract employees  including full time employees and contract employees in the united states  and  full time employees and contract employees in china 
we have never had a work stoppage 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
we have entered into employment agreements with substantially all of our employees in china 
in general  these employment agreements provide for either a one or two year term 
in addition  we believe that less than ten of our employees in china have formed a trade union committee and thereafter proposed that we enter into a collective bargaining agreement 
at this time  we are not a party to  nor do we intend to enter into  a collective bargaining agreement with these or any of our other employees at any of our facilities in china 
we are not aware that the committee represents any employee other than the employees who actually are members of the committee 
we presently do not believe that we will experience any material harm to our business if we do not enter into a collective bargaining agreement 
environmental controls flexible printed circuit manufacturing requires the use of chemicals 
as a result  we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture our products in the united states and china 
as of september  and  we reserved  and  of restricted cash  at the direction of the county of orange  california  to finance estimated environmental clean up costs in the event that we vacate our anaheim facilities  otherwise  our review of our facilities suggests that no material remediation costs will be required 

table of contents however  given the uncertainties associated with environmental contamination  there can be no assurance that such costs will not harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we believe we have been operating our facilities in substantial compliance in all material respects with existing environmental laws and regulations 
however  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied 
for this reason  we implemented procedures designed to minimize the negative impacts and reduce potential financial risks arising from environmental issues 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies could require substantial expenditures by us and could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we do not anticipate any material amount of environmental related capital expenditures in fiscal year item properties our corporate headquarters are located in anaheim  california and our manufacturing facilities are located in anaheim  california and suzhou  china 
we also have a facility located in tucson  arizona related to aurora optical

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and value added component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we offer customized flexible printed circuit applications and services ranging from design and application engineering  prototyping and high volume manufacturing to turnkey component assembly and testing 
we focus on portions of the electronics market where reduced packaging size and functionality dictate the need for flexible printed circuits and flexible printed circuit component assemblies  such as mobile phones  smart mobile devices  portable bar code scanners  personal digital assistants  data storage devices  power supplies and consumable medical sensors 
from our inception in until  we were engaged primarily in the manufacturing of flexible printed circuits for military and aerospace applications 
in early  we began to develop the concept of attaching components on flexible printed circuits for motorola 
through these early efforts  we developed the concept of the value added approach with respect to integrating our design engineering expertise with our component assembly capabilities 
this strategy has enabled us to capitalize on two trends over the course of the s  the outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shift of manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
in  we formed a wholly owned chinese subsidiary  mfc  to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and provide a cost effective  high volume production platform for the manufacture of our products 
mfc provides a complete range of capabilities and services to support our global customer base  including design engineering and high volume production of single sided  double sided and multi layer flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
in fiscal  we formed a second wholly owned subsidiary in china  mfc  to further expand our flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity 
in fiscal  we acquired the assets of applied optics  inc  a company which designed and manufactured optical and photonic imaging solutions  and now operate this business as aurora optical  inc  a subsidiary of m flex 
net sales we design and manufacture our products to customer specifications 
we engage the services of non exclusive sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
fifteen of these sales representatives are located throughout the united states 
we also have one sales representative in each of canada  europe  korea and taiwan 
the variety of products our customers manufacture are referred to as programs 
the majority of our sales are to customers outside of the united states 
sales volumes may be impacted by customer program and product mix changes and delivery schedule changes imposed on us by our customers 
all sales from our anaheim  california facilities are denominated in us dollars 
all sales from our china facilities are denominated in us dollars for sales outside china or chinese renminbi for sales made in china 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of four major categories material  overhead  labor and purchased process services 
material cost relates primarily to the purchase of copper foil  polyimide substrates and electronic components 
overhead costs include all materials and facilities associated with manufacturing support  processing supplies and expenses  support personnel costs  utilities  amortization of facilities and equipment and other related costs 
labor cost represents the cost of personnel related to the manufacture of the completed product 
purchased process services relate to the subcontracting of specific manufacturing processes to outside contractors 
cost of sales may be impacted by capacity utilization  manufacturing yields  product mix and production efficiencies 
also  we may be subject to increased costs as a result of changing material prices because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes commissions paid to sales representatives  personnel related costs associated with our customer division support groups and expenses for overseas sales support  trade show and promotional and marketing brochures 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and benefits of administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel and other expenses related to external accounting  legal and professional expenses  business insurance  management information systems  travel and entertainment and other corporate office expenses 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as we hire 
table of contents additional personnel and incur costs related to the anticipated growth of our company and our operations as a public company 
interest income expense  net interest income and expense  net  consists of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents balances and interest expense incurred on our lines of credit and loans payable 
other income expense  net other income and expense  net  consists primarily of income generated from the sale of scrap inventory in china as well as income or loss on our investment in mind wurx llc  or mind wurx 
in april  we agreed to provide mind wurx with advances to fund its operations and use of our facilities and personnel support in exchange for of its equity 
due to our ability to significantly influence the operations of mind wurx  we accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting 
we terminated our agreements with mind wurx in their entirety in march  however  we have retained our ownership interest 
provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes based on the statutory rates applicable in the countries in which we do business  subject to any tax holiday periods granted by the respective governmental authorities 
the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the american job creation act of  or the job creation act  was signed into law on october  the act contains provisions that will replace an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
as we are both an exporter and a domestic manufacturer  we are currently determining the impact this change could have on our financial statements 
the job creation act also allows us to repatriate  subject to certain restrictions  including restrictions on dividend payments by the foreign jurisdiction  our permanently reinvested foreign earnings in calendar year  at an effective united states tax rate of 
we are currently evaluating whether to take advantage of this opportunity and the potential impact any remitted foreign earnings would have on our financial statements 
the income tax effect of repatriation of foreign earnings cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues are generated from the sale of flexible printed circuit boards  which are sold to oems  subcontractors and ems providers to be included in other electronic products 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that states a fixed or determinable sales price  when title and risk of loss transfers  when delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale and collectibility of the related account receivable is reasonably assured 
our remaining obligation to customers after delivery is limited to our warranty obligations on our product 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision 
table of contents for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage and our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand  therefore  our estimates of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may increase or decrease  which we will record in the period such determination was made 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in the determination of any valuation allowance  we have considered taxable income in prior carryback years  future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
in addition  we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 
accounts receivable allowance 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible amounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the majority of our receivables are concentrated in relatively few customers  therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
warranty reserves 
we provide a day warranty on our products 
we provide a warranty reserve for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the net sales are recognized 
while we engage in quality programs and processes  up to and including the final product  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of the failed product and the inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing defective parts 
we continuously monitor and analyze product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of replacement vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of june of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii unanticipated competition  or iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the statement of operations data of m flex expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense operating income interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
the increase of million from fiscal to fiscal was attributable primarily to million of increased net sales to the wireless telecommunications sector  which accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal year versus in fiscal the increased wireless sales were attributable to the increased unit volume shipped and continued transition to flip phone style models  which utilize flexible circuitry  and the added level of phone features  which utilize additional flex circuits and value added components per phone 
in fiscal  industrial customers net sales of million  our second largest sector  increased by million or as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in volume of bar code scanners 
in addition  compared to the prior fiscal year  personal digital assistant sales increased by million or during fiscal and sales to the medical industry increased by million or during fiscal network telecommunications sales also increased by million or compared to the prior fiscal year during fiscal and power supply sales decreased by million or during fiscal cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained relatively unchanged at for fiscal versus for fiscal increases in the material cost percentage of sales in fiscal were offset by favorable declines in labor and overhead cost percentages  primarily attributable to the commencement of high volume production at mfc during the year 
the increase in material costs was due primarily to growth in the value added assembly portion of our business  which carries a higher material cost content  partially offset by improvements in production yields 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the year ended september  remained relatively constant at versus for the prior year 
the relatively consistent gross margins were primarily due to the continued benefit derived from the lower offshore cost structure and increased plant utilization  the leveraging of our fixed overhead cost structure on increased sales volume  as well as efficiency and manufacturing yield improvements on stable high volume production levels  which were offset by increased material costs per unit during fiscal our gross profit for the year ended september  included a million accrual for additional value added tax  duty and penalties in china 
we believe gross profits as a percentage of net sales may be at the higher end of our sustainable range 
sales and marketing expense 
sales representatives commissions and other sales related expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of  primarily due to lower average commission rates paid on high volume programs 
as a percentage of net sales  commissions decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal compensation and benefit expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of  primarily as the result of headcount increases in china to support the increased business volumes  increased wages and the acquisition of aurora optical in june as a percentage of net sales  compensation and benefit expense for fiscal remained relatively unchanged at as compared to fiscal even with our focus to continually decrease operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  we believe this may be at the lower end of our sustainable range 
general and administrative expense 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increased public company expenses  including sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  section compliance  audit costs and directors and officers insurance 
this was offset by the leveraging of a small increase in the compensation 
table of contents and benefits expense  due to increased headcount  over a much larger increase in net sales 
we believe general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales may be at the lower end of our sustainable range  as we expect savings from anticipated decreases in sox expenses to be offset by increases in compensation expense from i compliance with fas r  which we expect will reduce net income by approximately  to million in fiscal based on options outstanding as of september   ii the hiring of additional personnel and iii costs related to the anticipated growth of our company 
interest income expense  net 
net interest expense changed to income of  for fiscal from expense of  for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in net interest income was primarily due to interest earned on short term investments as well as the reduction of our outstanding debt balance during fiscal other income expense  net 
the other income in fiscal of  and other expense in fiscal of  was generated in large part by the sale of scrap inventory in china 
a principal component of the other expense for fiscal and fiscal was a  and  respectively  loss from our investment in mind wurx 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the higher effective tax rate is due primarily to the increase in the mfc tax rate from to on january  in addition  the higher effective tax rate is due to the recording of additional tax contingency reserves in connection with our domestic and foreign operations as well as the recording of a valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax benefits from capital loss carryforwards and losses from our investment in mind wurx 
we believe that it is more likely than not  that we will not receive the future benefits of these losses 
the effective tax rate of for the fiscal year ended september  does not reflect the impact of any potential repatriation of cash under the jobs creation act 
we are currently evaluating whether any foreign earnings will be repatriated  and to what extent  foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the united states might be repatriated 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
the increase of million was attributable primarily to million of increased net sales to the wireless telecommunications sector  which accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal year versus in fiscal the increased wireless sales were attributable to the increased unit volume shipped and continued transition to flip phone style models  which utilize flexible circuitry  and the added level of phone features  which utilize additional flex circuits and value added components per phone 
industrial customers net sales  our second largest sector  increased by million or as compared to fiscal  due to the growth of several new programs related to bar code scanners and industrial data storage devices 
the personal digital assistant  network telecommunications and power transmission sectors all remained relatively unchanged from the prior year levels 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to versus in the prior year 
increases in the material cost percentage of sales were offset by favorable declines in labor and overhead cost percentages  primarily attributable to the commencement of high volume production at mfc during the year 
the increase in material costs was due primarily to growth in net sales volume and the value added assembly portion of our business  which carries a higher material cost of sales content  partially offset by improvements in production yields 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to from in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increased benefit derived from the lower offshore cost structure and increased plant utilization  the leveraging of our fixed overhead cost structure on increased sales volume  as well as efficiency and manufacturing yield improvements on stable high volume production levels during fiscal sales and marketing expense 
sales representatives commissions and other sales related expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of  primarily due to higher net sales

general and administrative expense 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this percentage decrease was primarily attributable to leveraging of a small increase in the compensation and benefits expense  due to increased headcount  over a much larger increase in net sales 

table of contents interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in interest expense  net was primarily due to increased borrowings to support working capital needs as a result of the business growth and to support the capacity expansion in mfc additional interest expense was incurred on the ge capital asset loan as well as an interest penalty of  resulting from the early repayment of that debt in february other income expense  net 
the principal component of the other expense for fiscal and fiscal was a  and  respectively  loss from our investment in mind wurx 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate is due primarily to foreign tax credits utilized and a higher percentage of china generated pre tax income  which is taxed at a lower rate 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  equity offerings and borrowings under our various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance working capital  facility expansions  capital expenditures and debt service requirements

during fiscal  net income of million  adjusted for depreciation  deferred taxes  loss on equipment disposal and loss on equity investment generated million of operating cash  offset by million required for working capital 
it is our policy to carefully monitor the state of our business  cash requirements and capital structure 
we believe that cash on hand and funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth over at least the next months  however  there can be no assurance that any growth will occur and unexpected events may result in our need to raise additional capital 
changes in the principal components of working capital in our fiscal year were as follows our net accounts receivable increased to million at september  from million for the prior year  an increase of 
the increase in outstanding accounts receivable was attributable to the higher average monthly sales in fiscal versus the prior year

table of contents factors that may affect our operating results risks related to our business we depend on motorola and subcontractors of motorola for a significant portion of our net sales and if we lose these relationships  our net sales would decline 
for the past several years  a substantial portion of our net sales has been derived from products that have been incorporated into products that are manufactured by or on behalf of motorola  inc for the years ended september  and  and  respectively  of our net sales were to motorola and and of its subcontractors  respectively 
several subcontractors of motorola also constitute significant customers of ours 
for the years ended september   and  sales of our products to hosiden fd corporation and its affiliates  optrex corporation japan and its affiliates and koninklijke philips electronics nv and its affiliates accounted for  and   and  and  and of our net sales  respectively 
although generally we assist motorola in the design of products and motorola directs subcontractors to purchase products from us  one or more subcontractors could look to another source for the components to be incorporated into the products they supply to motorola 
in addition  if motorola were to reduce its orders to any of these customers or if motorola were to choose another flexible printed circuit assembly manufacturer to supply any portion of its products  it could reduce the orders that these customers place with us  which could substantially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must obtain orders from new and existing customers on an ongoing basis to increase our net sales and grow our business 
we are continuing our efforts to reduce dependence on a limited number of customers  however  net sales attributable to motorola and its subcontractors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of motorola and its subcontractors  a significant reduction in sales we make to them  a reduction in the pricing of our products sold to them or any problem collecting accounts receivable from them would reduce our net income 
we are heavily dependent upon the wireless telecommunications industry  and any downturn in the industry may reduce our net sales 
for the years ended september  and  and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from sales to companies that provide products or services to the wireless telecommunications industry 
in general  the wireless telecommunications industry is subject to economic cycles and has experienced in the past  and is likely to experience in the future  periods of slowdown 
intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand characterize the industry as a whole 
the wireless telecommunications industry also generally is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
fluctuations in demand for our products as a result of periods of slowdown in the telecommunications market or discontinuation of products or modifications developed in connection with next generation products could reduce our net sales 
our customers have and may continue to cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production or qualify additional vendors  any of which could reduce our net sales 
substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and we are not always able to predict with certainty the timing or magnitude of these orders 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to receive any order from our customers  and our net sales will be harmed if we are unable to obtain and ship a sufficient number of orders from customers in each quarter 
in addition  our customers may cancel  change or delay product purchase orders with little or no advance notice to us 
also  we believe customers may be increasing the number of vendors upon which they rely for manufacturing 
qualification of additional vendors for an application for which we are also qualified may cause our forecast of sales to be higher than actual net sales 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we are not able always to forecast with certainty the net sales that we will make in a given period and sometimes we may increase our production capacity  working capital and overhead in expectation of orders that may never be placed  or  if placed  may be delayed  reduced or canceled 
the following factors  among others  affect our ability to forecast accurately our net sales and production capacity changes in the specific products or quantities our customers order  variability in our manufacturing yields  
table of contents long lead times and advance financial commitments for our plant and equipment expenditures  long lead times and advance financial commitments for components required to complete anticipated customer orders  and price reductions due to competitive pressure 
delayed  reduced or canceled orders also may result in our inability to recover costs that we incur in anticipation of those orders  such as costs associated with purchased raw materials 
in addition  delayed  reduced or canceled orders may result in write offs of obsolete inventory and the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity if we decline other potential orders because we expect to use our capacity to produce orders that are later delayed  reduced or canceled 
we will have difficulty selling our products if customers do not design our flexible printed circuit products into their product offerings  if our customers product offerings are not commercially successful  or if we do not timely execute our operational and strategic plans 
we sell our flexible printed circuit products directly or indirectly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that include our products and component assemblies in their product offerings 
as a result  we rely on oems to select our products to be designed into their product offerings 
we must qualify our products with our customers  which involves demonstrating to our customers that our products can be manufactured within specified tolerances 
this process can be time consuming  complex  costly and difficult 
if an oem selects one of our competitors to provide a product instead of us  it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that oem because changing component providers after the initial production runs begin involves significant cost  time  effort and risk for the oem 
our customers typically are not obligated to purchase products from us and can stop using our products at any time 
even if an oem designs one of our products into its product offering  we have no assurance that the product will be commercially successful  that we will receive any order from that manufacturer or that we will not be undercut by a competitor s pricing 
we cannot be certain that our current products will continue to be selected for design into our customers products or that our customers will not also qualify additional vendors for their products 
in addition  our long term strategy relies in part on new technologies and products 
we cannot be certain that our new technology and products will be selected by customers  especially if we are unable to obtain certain industry approval  including underwriters laboratory approval for our charger products  on a timely basis 
if we are unable to obtain additional customer qualifications  if we cannot qualify our products for high volume production quantities  if we do not execute our operational and strategic plans for new products in a timely manner or if our customers increase their reliance on additional sources for their production  our net sales may decrease 
wbl corporation beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock and is able to exert influence over us and our major corporate decisions 
wbl corporation beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of wbl corporation s ownership interest and its influence over the composition of our board of directors  wbl corporation has influence over our management  operations and potential significant corporate actions 
for example  so long as wbl corporation continues to control more than a majority of our outstanding common stock  it will have the ability to control who is elected to our board of directors each year 
in addition  for so long as wbl corporation effectively owns at least one third of our voting stock  it has the ability  through a stockholders agreement with us  to approve the appointment of any new chief executive officer or the issuance of securities that would reduce wbl corporation s effective ownership of us to a level that is below a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock 
under generally accepted accounting principles in singapore  wbl corporation is deemed to effectively own approximately of our current outstanding stock 
this concentration of ownership may also discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company  which could deprive our other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our company  could harm the market price of our common stock and could impede the growth of our company 
to the extent that wbl corporation beneficially owns a significant portion of our outstanding common stock  even if less than a majority  it will continue to have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders 
wbl corporation is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party  including a participant in our industry  or from buying additional shares of our stock 

table of contents wbl corporation and its designees on our board of directors may have interests that conflict with our interests 
wbl corporation and its designees on our board of directors may have interests that conflict with  or are different from  the interests of our other stockholders 
for example  mfs technology limited  or mfs  a subsidiary of wbl corporation that is located in singapore  competes with us in many markets  including telecommunications 
there is a risk that conflicts of interest may arise because of wbl corporation s substantial ownership of us and mfs 
these conflicts of interest could include potential competitive business activities  corporate opportunities  indemnity arrangements  registration rights  sales or distributions by wbl corporation of our common stock and the exercise by wbl corporation of its ability to influence our management and affairs 
if any conflict of interest is not resolved in a manner favorable to our stockholders  our stockholders interests may be substantially harmed 
except as specified below  wbl corporation does not have the ability to prevent us from making operational decisions that do not require stockholder approval  however  wbl corporation does have the ability to control who is elected to our board of directors each year and therefore can influence decisions that require board approval 
in addition  pursuant to our stockholders agreement with wbl corporation  for so long as wbl corporation effectively owns at least one third of our voting stock  it has the ability to approve the appointment of any new chief executive officer or the issuance of securities that would reduce wbl corporation s effective ownership of us to a level that is below a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock 
in general  our certificate of incorporation does not contain any provision designed to facilitate resolution of actual or potential conflicts of interest or to ensure that potential business opportunities that may become available to both wbl corporation and us will be reserved for or made available to us 
wbl corporation is currently unable to vote its shares on specified matters that require stockholder approval without obtaining its own stockholders and regulatory approval and it is possible that wbl corporation s stockholders or the relevant regulators may not approve the proposed corporate action 
we have been advised by wbl corporation that the individuals representing wbl corporation who are on our board have authority to vote our shares of common stock  however  prior to voting our shares of common stock on any significant matter or disposing of our shares of common stock  the approval of wbl corporation s board of directors must be obtained 
in addition  wbl corporation is listed on the singapore exchange 
under the rules of the singapore exchange  to the extent that we constitute a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation  as defined by the rules of the singapore exchange  at any time that we submit a matter for the approval of our stockholders  wbl corporation also may be required to obtain the approval of its own stockholders for such action before it can vote its shares with respect to our proposal or dispose of our shares of common stock 
for the fiscal year ended september   we were a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation as defined by the rules of the singapore exchange  which state that we are deemed a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation for any given fiscal year that our audited consolidated pre tax profits consolidated into wbl corporation accounts for more than of the consolidated pre tax profits of wbl corporation during our immediately prior fiscal year 
we expect to continue to be a principal subsidiary of wbl corporation for the foreseeable future 
examples of corporate action we may seek to take for which we would need to obtain our stockholder approval include an amendment of our certificate of incorporation  a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  a merger or reorganization transaction  and an issuance of shares of our common stock in an offering other than a public offering at a price of less than fair market value if the number of shares being sold exceed of our then outstanding common stock 
to obtain stockholder approval  wbl corporation must prepare a circular describing the proposal  obtain approval from the singapore exchange and send the circular to its stockholders  which may take several weeks or longer 
in addition  wbl corporation is required under its corporate rules to give its stockholders notice of the meeting ranging from to days 
consequently  if we need to obtain the approval of wbl corporation at a time in which we qualify as a principal subsidiary including this year  the process of seeking wbl corporation s stockholder approval may delay our proposed action and it is possible that wbl corporation s stockholders may not approve our proposed corporate action 
it is also 
table of contents possible that we might not be able to establish a quorum at our stockholder meeting if wbl corporation was unable to vote at the meeting as a result of the singapore exchange rules 
the rules of the singapore exchange that govern wbl corporation are subject to revision from time to time  and policy considerations may affect rule interpretation and application 
it is possible that any change to or interpretation of existing or future rules may be more restrictive and adverse to us than the existing rules and interpretations 
if we are unable to attract or retain personnel necessary to operate our business  our ability to develop and market our products successfully could be harmed 
we are heavily dependent on our current executive officers and management 
the loss of any key employee or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including engineers and sales and marketing personnel  could delay the development and introduction of  and harm our ability to sell  our products and damage the market s perception of us 
we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of philip a 
harding  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  and reza meshgin  our president and chief operating officer 
we do not have employment contracts with these or any other key personnel  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
in addition  an increase in the number of manufacturers in suzhou  china and the surrounding areas could increase the competition for qualified employees and accordingly  the costs of retaining such employees  in china 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management  finance  engineering and sales and marketing personnel  including in the camera module business and any new line of business we acquire 
rapidly changing standards and competing technologies could make our products obsolete  which would cause our net sales to decrease 
the development and evolution of markets for our flexible printed circuit products depends on industry standards 
our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards  such as operating temperature range 
competing standards may emerge that are preferred by our customers 
we will need to make capital expenditures to support technological advances and to develop and manufacture new products and product features that our customers demand 
in addition  any new product we introduce may have competing technologies available from which we may have to choose 
if we choose technology or a standard that does not become the industry standard  we may be unable to sell those products or we may be unable to obtain a supplier for the raw materials for such products 
we also expect future flexible printed circuits and component assembly solutions to require higher performance specifications  including  for example  higher density circuitry than we have historically produced  and to incorporate new materials and components which may impact manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
we may incur higher manufacturing costs if manufacturing processes or standards change  and we may need to replace  modify or design  build and install equipment  all of which would require additional capital expenditures 
if our customers were to switch to alternative technologies or adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible or fail to adopt standards with which our products are compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to our customers and our net sales may decrease 
problems with manufacturing yields could result in higher operating costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
if we cannot achieve expected yields in the manufacture of our products  we may incur higher per unit costs  lower profits and reduced product availability 
low yields may result from  among other things  design errors or manufacturing failures in new or existing products 
any reduction in our ability to timely deliver products to customers could adversely affect our customer relationships and make it more difficult to sustain and grow our business 
we may not be able to compete effectively  which will cause our net sales and market share to decline 
on a global level  we compete primarily with large flexible printed circuit board manufacturers located in taiwan  china or japan and  to a lesser degree  with smaller manufacturers of flexible printed circuits and component assemblies located in europe and north america 
we also compete with mfs  a subsidiary of wbl corporation located in singapore 
if we do not compete successfully  our net sales and market share may decline 
we believe that one of our principal competitive advantages is our ability to interact closely with our customers throughout the design and engineering process 
if we are not successful in maintaining or establishing close relationships with customers in markets in which we compete  we may not be able to grow our market share or net sales 
to the extent that we are not able to provide regular interaction between our engineers and our customers and potential customers  our business may be harmed 
in some cases  our competitors may offer 
table of contents more favorable pricing to potential or existing customers 
in addition  we believe more companies are now producing flexible printed circuit boards than before 
such competition could increase pressure on us to lower our prices  which  in turn  would harm our margins and operating results 
in addition  many of our customers are larger  established electronic manufacturing services  or ems  providers 
certain of these ems providers have developed their own flexible printed circuit manufacturing capabilities or have extensive experience in electronics assembly  and in the future  may cease ordering products from us and may compete with us on future oem programs 
furthermore  many companies in our target customer base are moving the design and manufacturing of their products to original design manufacturers  or odms  in asia 
if we are unable to compete with these odms  we may be unable to sustain or grow our business 
our products and their terms of sale are subject to various pressures from our customers and our competitors  any of which could harm our gross profit 
we deal with a limited number of large customers who are able to exert significant pressure on us  both in terms of pricing and contract terms 
we enter into price reduction negotiations with these customers on an annual  semi annual or quarterly basis 
we also renegotiate the terms of our contracts  which specify  among other items  quality requirements  liability and indemnification thresholds and payment terms  with many of our customers on an annual basis 
we may lose our market share if we do not participate in such negotiations  furthermore  our participation in price reduction activities may result in lower margins for us and the extension of payment terms for our customers could negatively affect our cash flow 
our selling prices are also affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy  pricing of competitors products and our products life cycles 
in addition  from time to time we may elect to reduce the price of certain programs we produce in order to gain additional orders on those programs 
a typical life cycle for one of our products begins with higher prices when the product is introduced and decreasing prices as it matures 
to offset price decreases during a product s life cycle  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yield and productivity to reduce a product s cost 
if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during a product s life cycle  or if we are required to pay liquidated damages to a customer due to a breach of contract claim  including due to quality or delivery issues  our cost of sales may increase  which would result in decreased gross profit or increased gross loss in a period in which we do not have gross profit 
significant product failures could harm our reputation and our business 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  quality control  material costs and successful product testing capabilities are critical to our growth 
our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement stringent testing and manufacturing processes for our products may not be sufficient 
if any flaw in the design  production  assembly or testing of our flexible printed circuit products was to occur  we may experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in significant delays in product shipments  cancellation of orders  substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation 
any failure to maintain ongoing sales through our independent sales representatives could harm our business 
to date  we have sold our products through our direct sales force and a network of non exclusive independent sales representatives 
we rely on these sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
our sales representatives are not obligated to continue selling our products  and they may terminate their arrangements with us at any time with limited notice 
it is possible that we may not be able to maintain or expand these relationships successfully or secure agreements with additional sales representatives on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
any failure to develop and maintain our relationships with these sales representatives and any failure of our sales representatives to effectively market our products could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to be able to procure raw materials and components on commercially reasonable terms to manufacture our products profitably 
at times  there are worldwide shortages of the raw materials and components used in the fabrication of flexible printed circuits and imaging solutions 
our customers require that we use raw materials and components that have been pre qualified by them  which limits further the supply of raw materials and components available to us and frequently results in our need to seek raw materials and components from a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers of certain of our raw materials and components may consider us too small of a customer to sell to directly  which could require us to buy through distributors  which could increase the cost of such raw materials and components 
we generally do not maintain a large surplus stock of raw materials or components for our products because the specific assemblies are uniquely applicable to the products we produce for our customers  therefore  we rely on short term supply contracts with third party suppliers to 
table of contents provide these raw materials and components in a timely fashion and on commercially reasonable terms 
our operations would be negatively impacted if we are unable to receive raw materials or components on a timely or cost effective basis 
given the rapid increase in demand for flexible printed circuits and imaging solutions  a worldwide shortage for these materials may exist from time to time 
in the past  a similar shortage for flexible printed circuit materials required that we qualify an additional supplier in order to maintain the delivery of our largest production run 
historically  we have experienced component delays of one to ten days  which we have managed by expediting our production schedules  resulting in insignificant delays to our customers 
we may not be successful in the future in managing any shortage of raw materials or components that we may experience 
we purchase substantially all of our materials used to make flexible printed circuits from two sources  ei dupont de nemours co  or dupont  and rogers corporation  or rogers 
in the fiscal years  and  we purchased approximately  and of these materials from dupont and approximately  and from rogers 
currently  molex inc  supertex  inc  panasonic and itt  inc 
are our largest component suppliers 
in the fiscal year  we purchased   and of our components from molex  supertex  panasonic and itt 
in the fiscal year  we purchased  and of our components from molex  supertex  panasonic and itt 
in the fiscal year  we purchased   and of our components from molex  supertex  panasonic and itt 
we face business  political  regulatory  operational  financial and economic risks because a significant portion of our operations and sales are to customers outside of the united states 
our primary manufacturing facilities are located in china 
although our headquarters are located in california and we also have operations in arizona  we expect that our operations in china will continue to assume a larger and more important role in our business 
we are subject to risks inherent in international business  many of which are beyond our control  including difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses and compliance with foreign laws  including employment laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including cultural differences in the conduct of business  labor and other workforce requirements and inadequate local infrastructure  the need to successfully migrate our foreign locations to the financial reporting system used by us in the united states  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels  longer payment cycles for  and greater difficulty collecting  accounts receivable  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that render our prices uncompetitive or increase our cost of doing business  specifically the chinese rmb  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  royalties and withholding taxes that restrict the repatriation of earnings and effects on our effective income tax rate due to profits generated or lost in foreign countries  political and economic instability  including wars  terrorism  political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  increases in the cost of doing business in china  including increases due to changes in environmental regulations  increased competition for employees and new or increased governmental fees or assessments  disruptions or shortages in the supply of electricity or other utilities  and public health emergencies such as sars and avian bird flu 
any of these factors could harm our future international sales and operations significantly 

table of contents our manufacturing capacity may be interrupted  limited or delayed if we cannot maintain sufficient sources of electricity in china  or if there is a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in china 
the flexible printed circuit fabrication process requires a stable source of electricity 
as our production capabilities increase in china and our business grows  our requirements for a stable source of electricity in china will grow substantially 
we have experienced a lack of sufficient electricity supply and expect to continue to experience insufficient power supplies in the foreseeable future 
although we have purchased several generators  we cannot be assured that such generators will produce sufficient electricity supply in the event of a disruption in power 
power interruptions  electricity shortages  the cost of diesel fuel to run our back up generations or government intervention  particularly in the form of rationing  are factors that could restrict our access to electricity in suzhou  china  the location of our chinese manufacturing facilities  and affect our manufacturing costs 
any such shortages could result in delays in our shipments to our customers and  potentially  the loss of customer orders and penalties from such customers for the delay 
our two primary manufacturing facilities are both located in suzhou  china 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events  including wildfires and other fires  earthquakes  excessive rain  terrorist attacks and wars  could disrupt our manufacturing ability  which could harm our operations and financial results 
china s legal system embodies uncertainties that could harm our business operations 
since  many new laws and regulations covering general economic matters have been promulgated in china 
despite the development of the legal system  china s system of laws is not yet complete 
even where adequate law exists in china  enforcement of contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic  and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction 
the relative inexperience of china s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation 
in addition  interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes 
our activities in china will be subject to administrative review and approval by various national and local agencies of china s government 
given the changes occurring in china s legal and regulatory structure  we may not be able to secure the requisite governmental approval for our activities 
failure to obtain the requisite governmental approval for any of our activities could impede our ability to operate our business or increase our expenses 
we may not address successfully problems encountered in connection with any acquisition 
we expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies  products and businesses that could enhance our capabilities  complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies 
potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks  including problems assimilating the purchased technologies  products or business operations  including the timely integration of financial reporting systems  problems maintaining uniform standards  procedures  controls and policies  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  start up costs associated with a new line of business acquired in any acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering new markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  the need to acquire a new supplier base for the materials and components associated with a new line of business  the need to hire additional employees to operate effectively the acquired business  including employees with specialized knowledge  and increased legal and accounting costs as a result of the sarbanes oxley act 

table of contents if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions and strategic investments properly  our management team may be distracted from our day to day operations  our business may be disrupted and our operating results may suffer 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders would be diluted 
we may have difficulty managing any growth that we might experience 
if we continue to experience growth in our operations  our manufacturing facilities  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls may need to be expanded  which will distract our management team from our business plan and involve increased expenses 
our success will depend substantially on the ability of our management team to manage any growth effectively 
these challenges may include the ability of our management to predict accurately increases or decreases in demand for our products and manage our manufacturing capacity appropriately  maintaining our cost structure at an appropriate level based on the net sales we generate  managing multiple  concurrent manufacturing expansion projects  implementing and improving our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  managing operations in multiple locations and multiple time zones  the ability to timely and in a cost effective manner increase our manufacturing capacity and build new manufacturing facilities in order to meet customer demands  and the ability to acquire customers in a new line of business 
the sarbanes oxley act and other rules and regulations may increase the time and costs of certain activities 
in addition  we incur significant legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company 
the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have increased our financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly 
we also expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and  from time to time  we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
we continue to evaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
our business is capital intensive and the failure to obtain capital could require that we curtail capital expenditures 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment  facilities and technological improvements 
we expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
we may need to raise additional funds through further debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  under the terms of our stockholders agreement  wbl corporation s approval is required for the issuance of securities that would reduce its effective ownership of us to a level that is below a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock 
if wbl corporation s approval is required  it is possible that wbl corporation may not approve of any transaction we may seek to complete  which could affect whether we are able to complete such a transaction 
if we cannot raise the required capital when needed  we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose net sales and market share 
the following factors could affect our ability to obtain additional capital on favorable terms  or at all our results of operations  general economic conditions and conditions in the electronics industry  
table of contents the perception of our business in the capital markets  our ratio of debt to equity  our financial condition  our business prospects  wbl corporation s approval  if required  the international aspects of our business  including the foreign location of a majority of our physical assets and the fact that a majority of our customers are located overseas  and interest rates 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future  we may have to curtail our capital expenditures 
any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net sales  reduced quality of our products  increased manufacturing costs for our products  harm to our reputation  reduced manufacturing efficiencies or other harm to our business 
we are subject to the risk of increased income and other taxes in china 
we currently enjoy tax holidays and other tax incentives for our operations in china 
the tax holiday rate of for our first manufacturing facility in china  mfc  will expire on december  after this time  mfc will be subject to an income tax rate of 
for the fiscal years ended september  and we realized tax savings of million and million respectively  for our operations in china related to mfc we also have obtained a tax holiday for our new manufacturing facility in china  mfc  that allows for tax free operation for the first two years beginning in the first year of profitability followed by three years of operation at a reduced rate of income tax equal to 
beginning on january   mfc will be subject to a tax holiday rate of 
however  this tax holiday may be challenged  modified or even eliminated by taxing authorities or changes in law 
we cannot determine with certainty the amount of tax savings we will realize  if any  as a result of this tax holiday 
in february  china s deputy finance minister announced that the chinese government plans to unify the tax code for domestic and foreign companies by as early as  thereby eliminating the current tax holidays 
the new rate is expected to be between and and is expected to treat domestic and foreign entities equally 
the exact timing and nature of the changes to china s tax code are unknown at this time 
without the benefit of the tax holiday for our china operations  our net income in prior periods would have been reduced and net income in future periods will be reduced 
we are also currently in the process of an audit in china relating to the import and export of raw and component materials at mfc we have been advised by the relevant custom authorities that upon completion of this audit  we may be required to pay value added tax and duty  plus interest and penalties  due to shortages in  and or excess stock of  these raw and component materials 
we estimate that the net impact of the value added tax  duty  interest and penalties as a result of this audit will be million  which has been accrued as of september   however  this estimate may not be correct and we may be required to pay more or less  as a result of such review 
our bank facilities contain restrictive covenants that  if not satisfied or waived  could impact our ability to borrow money under these facilities and could result in acceleration of our debt obligations under these facilities that may be outstanding from time to time 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants in our bank facilities could result in an event of default which  if not satisfied or waived  could preclude us from borrowing money under one or more of these facilities or may result in us being required to repay any borrowings we may have under our facilities from time to time 
in addition  our facility with norddeutsche landesbank girozentrale  or nlg  provides that nlg can refuse to honor a draw request from us for any reason  even if we are in full compliance with the terms of the facility 
if we were unable to borrow under these facilities to finance our operations or we were unable to refinance borrowings under our facilities that may come due  our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

table of contents if we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technologies  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our net sales or increase our costs 
we primarily rely on trade secrets relating to our manufacturing processes to protect our proprietary rights 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be effective and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies 
we compete in industries with rapid development and technological innovation 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately  our competitors could offer similar products using processes or technologies developed by us and thereby potentially harm our competitive position and our financial condition 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
from time to time  we have received  and expect to continue to receive  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
some of these claims may lead to litigation 
any intellectual property lawsuit  whether or not determined in our favor or settled  could be costly  could harm our reputation and could divert our management from normal business operations 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of our proprietary rights 
a successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property 
in addition  we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology  and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to develop a non infringing technology on a timely basis or to license the infringed technology on acceptable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
complying with environmental laws and regulations may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used in the manufacture of flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
a significant part of our manufacturing operations is located in china  where we are subject to constantly evolving environmental regulation 
the costs of complying with any change in such regulations and the costs of remedying potential violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by governmental entities in china could be substantial 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data for materials used in our manufacturing processes 
we reserved  and  of restricted cash for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively  at the direction of the county of orange  california  to finance estimated environmental clean up costs in the event that we vacate our anaheim facilities 
in the event of a violation  we may be required to halt one or more segments of our operations until such violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of remedying violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by governmental authorities could be substantial 
any remediation of environmental contamination would involve substantial expense that could harm our results of operations 
in addition  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations may be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations may be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations could be significant 
risks related to the market for our common stock our stock price may be volatile  and you may not be able to resell our shares at a profit or at all 
the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate due to the factors discussed in this report and elsewhere in our sec filings 
for example  during the months ended september   our stock traded between and per share 
the trading market for our common stock also may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our industry 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us were to publish an unfavorable research report or to downgrade our stock  our stock price likely would decline 
if one or more of these analysts were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  and nasdaq and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
our historical trading prices and valuations may not be sustainable 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
in the event we are unable to remedy any deficiency we identify in our system of internal controls over financial reporting  or if our internal controls are not effective  our business and our stock price could suffer 
in preparation for the annual report of management regarding our evaluation of our internal controls that is required to be included in the annual report for the year ended september  by section of the sarbanes oxley act  or section  we are adopting a project work plan to assess the adequacy of our internal controls  remediate any deficiency that we may identify  validate that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal controls 
as part of this continuous process  we may discover deficiencies that require us to improve our procedures  processes and systems in order to ensure that our internal controls are adequate and effective and that we are in compliance with the requirements of section although we have a timeline and schedule that we believe are appropriate to comply with the requirements of section  if any found deficiency is not adequately addressed  or if we are unable to complete all of our testing and any remediation in time for compliance with the requirements of section and the sec rules thereunder  we would be unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively  which could adversely affect investor confidence in our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we do not complete our testing with sufficient time for independent accountants to complete their audit of internal controls  we may not be compliant with all of the requirements under section since we may not receive an unqualified independent registered public accounting firms report  and our business and stock price may be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in demand for our products  our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes and costs and the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity 
historically  we have experienced a strong first fiscal quarter  followed by reduced net sales in the second fiscal quarter  as a result of partial seasonality of our major customers and the markets that we serve 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales is likely to continue 
as a result  our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our net sales and results of operations may be below our expectations or the expectations of analysts and investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our expense levels in the future will be based  in large part  on our expectations regarding net sales 
many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales 
we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
future sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
as of december  we had  shares of common stock outstanding and  shares subject to unexercised options that are fully vested 
all of these shares are eligible for resale  subject to certain volume limitations 
to the extent any major stockholder sells its shares into the market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
delaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include the following the establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that not all directors be elected at one time  
table of contents a majority of our directors are required to be independent  the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the size of our board of directors without stockholder approval  the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors created by the death  resignation or incapacity of a director or the enlargement of the board of directors without stockholder approval  the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting  the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval  the ability of the board of directors to issue and designate the rights of  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock  which rights could be senior to those of common stock  the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent  and so long as a single or related group of stockholders own at least one third of our outstanding common stock  a transaction between us and any person or entity in which such stockholder or stockholders have a material interest  if required under applicable federal and state law and or nasdaq rules to be approved by our stockholders  will require approval of a majority of the outstanding shares not held by such interested stockholders present in person or by proxy at the meeting of stockholders held with respect to such transaction 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  or delaware law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our charter  bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at september   no amounts were outstanding under our loan agreements with nlg  shanghai pudong development bank and bank of china 
the amounts outstanding under these loan agreements at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in interest would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we derive a substantial portion of our sales outside of the united states 
approximately million  or  of total shipments to these foreign manufacturers for fiscal was made in us dollars 
the balance of our sales are denominated in chinese renminbi  or rmb 
the exchange rate for the rmb to the us dollar has been an average of rmb per us dollar for the fiscal year ended september  transactions in rmb represent approximately of total net sales from foreign customers for the fiscal year ended september  in july  the people s bank of china  or pboc  terminated the fixed exchange rate between the rmb and the us dollar and adjusted the exchange rate from to us a maximum daily appreciation against the us dollar limit was established by the pboc 
we generally do not consider it necessary to hedge against currency risk  as a significant portion of our material cost of sales is denominated in us dollars  eliminating much of the need to hedge  however  we continue to be vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the us dollar
