this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section of this item our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
overview this overview is not a complete discussion of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of our financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the discussion that follows 
the detailed discussion and analysis that follows must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand our financial condition and results of operations 
entegris  inc is a leading provider of materials integrity management products and services that purify  protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and data storage industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia and europe 
effective august  entegris  inc  a minnesota corporation  and mykrolis corporation  a delaware corporation  completed a strategic merger of equals transaction  pursuant to which they were each merged into a new delaware corporation named entegris  inc to carry on the combined businesses 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of mykrolis by entegris 
with the merger with mykrolis corporation  the company added liquid and gas filters  liquid delivery systems  components and consumables used to precisely measure  deliver  control and purify the process liquids  gases and chemicals that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process to our materials integrity management product offerings 
after the merger with mykrolis  the company offers a diverse product portfolio which includes more than  standard and customized products that we believe provide the most comprehensive offering of materials integrity management products and services to the microelectronics industry 
our materials integrity management products purify  protect and transport critical materials in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
certain of these products are unit driven and consumable products that rely on the level of semiconductor manufacturing activity to drive growth while others rely on expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth 
our unit driven and consumable product class includes wafer shippers  disk shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products  membrane based liquid filters and housings  metal based gas filters and resin based gas purifiers  as well as pva roller brushes for use in post cmp cleaning applications 
our capital expense driven products include our process carriers that protect the integrity of in process wafers  components  systems and subsystems that use electro mechanical  pressure differential and related technologies  to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes 
on september  we announced that we would divest our gas delivery  life science and tape and reel product lines 
we expect these divestitures to be completed during late calendar or early calendar the gas delivery products include mass flow controllers  pressure controllers and vacuum gauges that are used by customers in manufacturing operations to measure and control process gas flow rates and to control and monitor pressure and vacuum levels during the manufacturing process 
the life sciences products include stainless steel clean in place systems for life sciences applications 
tape and reel products include our stream product line  which is a packaging system designed to protect and transport microelectronic components  while enabling the high speed automated placement of the components onto printed circuit boards used for today s electronics 
however  as part of the purchase accounting entries related to the merger  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the gas delivery business have been classified as assets held for disposal and liabilities of the business to be disposed 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period ending on the last saturday of august 
the last three fiscal years ended on the following dates august   august   and august  and all included weeks 
fiscal years are identified in this report according to the calendar year in which they end 
for example  the fiscal year ended august  is alternatively referred to as fiscal or key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc include the level of sales since a large portion of the company s product costs excepting raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affects certain costs such as incentive compensation  commissions and donations  all of which are highly variable in nature 
the variable margin on sales  which is determined by selling prices and the cost of manufacturing and raw materials  has a large effect on profit 
this is also affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sale mix  purchase prices of raw material  especially resin  purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 
the company has experienced significant increases in resin prices as a result of oil price increases in  leading to lower margins 
the company s fixed cost structure is significant increases or decreases in sales have a large impact on profitability 
there are a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor  and benefits  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily and in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
thus changes in sales volumes can affect the usage and productivity of these cost components and can have a large effect on the company s results of operations 
overall summary of fiscal financial results net sales in fiscal increased by over the prior year 
this sales improvement was principally driven by the inclusion of sales from mykrolis for the three week period subsequent to the date of the merger 
overall business activity in the semiconductor market was relatively flat although specific product lines experienced stronger order and sales activity while certain other lines were lower than prior years 
the company s higher sales were associated with its data storage products while the life science and wafer handling businesses were flat or lower 
although sales increased year over year  the company reported lower gross margins due to changes in its sales mix with greater sales coming from mm wafer products with relatively lower margins  higher resin prices  certain restructuring costs related to consolidation of some of its manufacturing facilities and the amortization of the write up of inventory acquired as part of the merger with mykrolis 
the company also had significantly higher general and administrative costs as a result of the merger 
these costs included the costs of integration activities  severance and termination costs and other transaction costs that were expensed during the period 
as a result  the company reported lower net income for the year when compared to a year ago 
mykrolis acquisition on august   entegris acquired mykrolis corporation for a purchase price of approximately million  which included entegris common stock and vested share awards  as well as transaction costs 
mykrolis is a worldwide developer  manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas delivery systems  components and consumables used to precisely measure  deliver  control and purify the process liquids  gases and chemicals that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
the fair value of entegris equity items was derived using an average market price per share of entegris common stock of  which was based on entegris average stock price for the period two days before through two days after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced on march  under the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of mykrolis common stock was exchanged for shares of entegris common stock in a tax free transaction 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from mykrolis are recorded at the date of acquisition  at their respective fair values 
the consolidated financial statements and reported results of operations of entegris issued after completion of the acquisition reflect these values 
the purchase price of million has been preliminarily allocated based on an estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the final valuation of net assets is expected to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than one year from the acquisition date 
given the size and complexity of the acquisition  the fair valuation of certain net assets is still being finalized 
to the extent that our estimates need to be adjusted  the company will do so 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
net sales the company s net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment  primarily fob shipping point  when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable based upon historical collection results and regular credit evaluations 
in most transactions  the company has no obligations to its customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in the event that significant post shipment obligations or uncertainties exist such as customer acceptance  revenue recognition is deferred as appropriate until such obligations are fulfilled or the uncertainties are resolved 
for construction contracts for certain customized clean in place equipment  the company recognizes revenues under the percentage of completion method  measured by the cost to cost method 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management analyzes the age of receivable balances  historical bad debts write off experience  industry and geographic concentrations of customers  general customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at august  and august   respectively 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical trends and current trends in product returns 
at august  and august   the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or market value 
each quarter  the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a full valuation allowance is recorded 
in addition  valuation allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory valuation allowances were million at august  compared to million at august  the company s inventories comprise materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current analyses  additional inventory write downs or valuation allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of its property and equipment assets  particularly its molding equipment  are present 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the assets are less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
the company assesses the impairment of intangible assets and related goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period changing the company s market capitalization relative to its net book value  income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings in its international operations  therefore  no us tax expense has been recorded to cover the repatriation of such undistributed earnings 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
the company carried no valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at either august  or august  warranty claims accrual the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at august  and august   the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
business acquisitions the company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income 
accordingly  for significant items  the company typically obtains assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  the company normally utilizes the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows including timing and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact net income 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for fiscal years  and the company s historical financial data were derived from its audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  research and development expenses other charges operating profit loss interest income  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates income tax benefit expense equity in net loss of affiliates net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase reflected improvement in certain product lines and the impact of the merger with mykrolis that was closed on august   three weeks prior to the end of the company s fiscal year 
the company estimates that approximately two thirds of the sales increase for was associated with the mykrolis merger 
the increase from the mykrolis merger is included in the category other in the table below 
the following table summarizes total net sales by markets served for and  along with the year to year percentage change in thousands percent change net sales semiconductor data storage services other the semiconductor market generated about of the company s overall sales for fiscal  compared to about in the prior year 
sales of semiconductor products decreased by from fiscal to both unit driven product lines such as wafer shippers  and test  assembly and packaging products and capital spending driven products  such as wafer and reticle carrier products and fluid handling products saw slight sales declines 
the company s data storage products accounted for about of consolidated net sales in  compared to a year ago 
year over year sales increased by as customers experienced significant increased demand for a wide range of consumer driven electronic products 
the increase in sales was particularly driven by results in the first three quarters of the fiscal year with sales moderating in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
sales of services rose from fiscal and accounted for of entegris overall sales  compared to about a year ago 
the increase reflects growth from a service facility acquired in france in the third quarter of fiscal along with increased sales of equipment used to clean wafer shippers  disk carriers and other shipping products 
other market sales rose from fiscal and accounted for of overall sales compared to a year ago 
nearly all of the increase in other market sales was a result of the mykrolis merger completed late in the fiscal year 
on a geographic basis  entegris fiscal sales in north america were of total sales  in asia pacific  in europe and in japan 
sales in all regions increased with the highest increase coming from the asia pacific region 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal decreased by to million  compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  the fiscal gross margin was  compared to in the reductions in the fiscal gross margin percentage figures were primarily the result of higher resin prices  estimated at slightly over basis points  a change in product mix to some relatively lower margin wafer process products  the fourth quarter million reduction in gross profit associated with the write up of inventory to fair value in connection with the merger with mykrolis and costs of million associated with consolidation of manufacturing facilities  mainly incurred in the fourth quarter 
the company expects resin prices to continue to rise for several months in the new fiscal year as oil and natural gas price increases from the previous year are passed on in commodity prices 
the company expects price increases of raw materials to moderate in the latter half of fiscal the company expects margins to be negatively affected in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of continuing amortization charges from the write up of inventory acquired in the merger with mykrolis 
the write up is being amortized over inventory turns and is expected to be fully utilized by november the company expects that there will be continued pricing and margin pressures in the mm wafer shipper and process products 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  increased to from 
this increase mainly reflects costs of incurred by the company in connection with the merger with mykrolis and includes severance and retention costs and costs associated with integration of the two operations as well the additional sg a expenses recorded by mykrolis after the date of the merger 
the company expects sg a costs to be higher than normal during the first two quarters of next fiscal as integration costs and related severance and retention costs will continue for this period 
in addition  the company expects the overall sg a costs to be higher as the company will have a full year of sales and operating expenses related to the merger 
the company expects that overall sg a costs will decline on a pro forma basis resulting from the combination of various sales  marketing and other corporate functions during these savings are expected to be realized in the latter half of calendar engineering  research and development expenses er d er d expenses were essentially flat in at compared to million in despite the slight increase in er d expenses  such costs as a percent of net sales  decreased to from  mainly reflecting the company s higher net sales 
as indicated earlier  a significant portion of the year over year sales growth was a result of the mykrolis merger towards the end of the year 
the company expects that er d costs will increase in however  these costs are expected to stay relatively stable as a percent of net sales 
the company s er d efforts continued to focus on the support or extension of current product lines  and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
operating profit loss operating profit  stated as a percent of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decline in was mainly due to lower gross profit as well as higher sg a expenses as described above 
interest income  net the company reported net interest income of million in compared to million in the increases reflect higher average net invested balances and higher rates of interest available on the company s investment in debt securities  when compared to a year ago 
in addition  interest income in the third quarter of fiscal included million related to interest on a tax refund received during the period 
other income expense  net other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other income in fiscal included gains of million associated with the sale of about million shares of nortem nv common stock as described in note to the company s consolidated financials statements 
other income in fiscal included gains of million associated with the sale of an aggregate  shares of nortem nv common stock made periodically over the course of fiscal the company also recorded foreign currency remeasurement losses of million in fiscal compared to foreign currency remeasurement losses of million in income tax benefit expense the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to income tax expense of million for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the company s effective tax rate in fiscal is lower than the statutory federal rate of in the united states due to lower taxes on foreign operations  a tax benefit associated with export activities  a tax benefit from the company s investment in tax exempt securities  a tax credit associated with research and development activities  and a benefit of million from the resolution of tax contingencies 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than the statutory federal rate of in the united states due to lower taxes on foreign operations  a tax benefit associated with export activities  and a tax credit associated with research and development activities 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase reflected continued improvement in the semiconductor industry and general economic conditions 
the sales improvement was principally driven by the improved sales of the company s semiconductor market product lines 
in addition  sales associated with the company s efforts to expand its materials integrity management expertise into new applications and expanded markets resulted in improved sales 
the company estimates that approximately one fifth of the sales increase for was associated with the sales generated by businesses or product lines acquired in the second quarter of fiscal for which no sales were recorded in the year ago period prior to the dates of the acquisitions 
net sales for fiscal also included favorable foreign currency effects  primarily related to the strengthening of the japanese yen  in the amounts of approximately million 
the following table summarizes total net sales by markets served for and  along with the year to year percentage change in thousands percent change net sales semiconductor data storage services other the semiconductor market generated about of the company s overall sales for  compared to about in the prior year 
sales of semiconductor products rose by from to unit driven product lines such as wafer shippers  and test  assembly and packaging products saw sales improvements in the range 
sales of capital spending driven products  such as wafer and reticle carrier products and fluid handling products  experienced sales gains generally exceeding year over year 
the company s data storage products accounted for about of consolidated net sales in  compared to a year ago 
year over year sales increased by as customers experienced a well publicized overbuild of hard disk drives in the later part of the year 
services market sales rose from fiscal and accounted for of entegris overall sales  compared to about a year ago 
this increase mainly reflects growth in both the company s sales of its on and off site cleaning services 
sales of equipment used to clean wafer  disk carrier and shipping products were essentially flat with those of a year earlier 
on a geographic basis  entegris fiscal sales in north america were of total sales  in asia pacific  in europe and in japan 
primarily on the strength of improved semiconductor sales  year over year sales comparisons saw sales gains in excess of in all regions  with sales to asia pacific up over 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  the fiscal gross margin was  compared to in gross profit dollar gains were reported by both domestic and international operations 
the improvements in fiscal gross margin percentage figures were primarily the result of the increased leverage associated with the improved sales levels noted above  which resulted in higher production levels 
several factors combined to partially offset the benefit of the higher utilization of the company s production capacity in fiscal as was the case in the prior year  gross margin levels were adversely affected by the stronger sales of the company s life sciences market products  where gross margins are below those of the semiconductor and data storage markets 
in addition  for much of the year  the company expanded its manufacturing staffing levels to address the rapidly increasing sales demand 
as a consequence of adding and training a large number of personnel  primarily temporary employees  operational efficiencies were not fully optimized 
as a result  the company believes it incurred expenses at a somewhat higher level than normal  offsetting the company s improved factory utilization 
the fiscal gross margin comparison to the prior year also benefited from the absence of certain items included in fiscal results 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began the process  which it essentially completed early in fiscal  of moving a portion of its manufacturing to a build to order model  which enabled the reduction of finished goods inventory 
these actions led to significant under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs during that period  accounting for approximately million in reduced gross profit 
fiscal also included transition costs of approximately million related to the integration of the wafer and reticle carrier product line acquisition 
the company also incurred costs in connection with the consolidation of several facilities in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  decreased to from 
this decline mainly reflects the leverage associated with the company s increase in net sales 
the year over year increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation  profit sharing and donation accruals reflecting the company s improved sales and profitability million  higher professional and consulting fees million  increased amortization expense million and compensation expense associated with the issuance of shares of restricted stock million 
related to the last item  the company changed a component of its long term equity based incentive programs by issuing fewer stock options and began issuing restricted stock grants 
under current accounting rules  the company is required to expense the intrinsic value of restricted stock grants over their four year graded vesting periods 
other charges the company incurred no other charges in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the relocation of its upland  california operations and certain workforce reductions 
the charge included million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees  million for estimated losses for asset impairment and million for future lease commitments on the upland facility 
as of august   future cash outlays of million remained outstanding in connection with the aforementioned charge and are related to lease commitments  which run through july the company recorded a pre tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the favorable settlement of a portion of the future lease commitments included in the aforementioned charge 
engineering  research and development expenses er d er d expenses increased to million in as compared to million in despite the increase in er d expenses  such costs as a percent of net sales  decreased to from  mainly reflecting the company s higher net sales 
about million of the year over year increase in er d expenses was due to the incremental costs of er d activities associated with the company s january acquisition of the assets of electrol specialties company and its february acquisition of asyst technologies  inc s wafer and reticle carrier product lines 
in addition  million and million of the increase reflected the company s investment in the development of its fuel cell  and tape and reel technologies  respectively 
the company er d efforts continued to focus on the support of current product lines  and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
interest income  net the company reported net interest income of million in compared to million in the decline reflects the lower rates of interest available on the company s investments in short term debt securities compared to the fiscal operating profit loss operating profit  stated as a percent of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to an operating loss  stated as a percent of net sales  of in fiscal the improvement in was mainly due to the leverage associated with increased sales levels  the effect of which was slightly offset by higher sg a and er d expenses as described above 
other income expense  net other income was million in fiscal compared to other expense of million in fiscal other income in fiscal included gains of million associated with the sale of an aggregate  shares of metron technology nv metron common stock made periodically over the course of fiscal other expense in included an impairment loss of million  or million after tax  related to the write down of the company s equity investment in metron common stock 
the company  a founding shareholder of metron  owned about million shares of metron common stock throughout prior to the impairment charge  the company s investment in metron technology nv common stock had a cost basis of million 
at november   the fair value of the investment was million  based on a price of per share  the closing price of metron at that date 
the decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
accordingly  an impairment loss of million was recorded and the investment in metron common stock written down to a new cost basis of million 
income tax expense benefit the company recorded income tax expense of million for fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the main factor contributing to this variance is the company s improvement in earnings from operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the company s effective tax rate in fiscal is lower than the statutory federal rate of in the united states due to lower taxes on foreign operations  a tax benefit associated with export activities  and a tax credit associated with research and development activities 
the income tax benefit for fiscal includes one time benefits of million from the redetermination of prior years taxes  million from the reversal of a valuation allowance on the net operating loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries  and million related to the impairment loss recorded on the company s investment in metron stock  as well as benefits associated with the factors noted above related to fiscal net income the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal quarterly results of operations the following table presents selected data from the company s consolidated statements of operations for the eight quarters ended august  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report

in fiscal  the company s results also included gains on the sale of equity investments  classified as other income  of million and million in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
our quarterly results of operations have been  and will likely continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  a number of which are beyond the company s control 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital requirements through cash flow from operating activities  long term loans  lease financing and borrowings under domestic and international short term lines of credit 
in fiscal  entegris raised capital via an initial public offering 
in fiscal  the company financed its merger with mykrolis corporation through the issuance of common stock and stock options 
operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
cash flow provided by operating activities in mainly reflected the company s net earnings  combined with various noncash charges  including depreciation and amortization of million 
such items were partly offset by the impact of working capital demands 
accounts receivable increased by million  while accounts receivable from affiliates decreased by million 
days sales outstanding increased from days at the beginning of the year to days at the end of the year  which compared to days two years earlier 
inventories decreased by million over the fiscal year end balance  mainly reflecting slight declines in raw material and work in process inventories 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million 
partly offsetting the net working capital decreases for receivables and inventory  accrued taxes fell by million  mainly reflecting the higher tax payments made by the company 
working capital stood at million at august   including million in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
investing activities cash flow provided by investing activities totaled million in cash flow used in investing activities totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the main component of the fiscal activity relates to the addition of million in cash and cash equivalents recorded in connection with the acquisition of mykrolis 
acquisition of property and equipment totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in included investments in manufacturing equipment of million  with the remainder invested in tooling  computer and office equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures during fiscal to be about million  consisting mainly of spending on facility expansions  manufacturing equipment  tooling and information systems 
the company expended million on direct costs associated with the acquisition of mykrolis 
exclusive of the mykrolis merger  cash expended on the acquisition of businesses totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the fiscal expenditure relates to contingent consideration and other payments paid in connection with the terms of prior years acquisitions 
the company recorded proceeds from maturities  net of purchases  of debt securities classified as short term investments of million during the company made purchases  net of proceeds from maturities  of million in and proceeds from maturities  net of purchases  of million in also  in fiscal and  the company recorded proceeds of million and million in connection with its sale of shares of nortem common stock as described above under the caption other income 
proceeds of million and million from the sale of various property and equipment were recorded in fiscal and  respectively 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company made payments of million on borrowings and received proceeds from new borrowings totaling million in the company recorded proceeds of million  million  and million in  and  respectively  in connection with common shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
as of august   the company s sources of available funds comprised million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments as well as access to various credit facilities 
entegris has an unsecured revolving credit agreement with one commercial bank for borrowings of up to million  with no borrowings outstanding at august  and lines of credit with five international banks that provide for borrowings of currencies for the company s overseas subsidiaries  equivalent to an aggregate of approximately million 
borrowings outstanding on these lines of credit were approximately million at august  at august   the company held restricted cash totaling million 
these funds were collateral related to a security deposit under a lease for one of the company s administrative  research and development and manufacturing facilities as well as other security deposits and were invested in certificates of deposit and money market funds at august  the following table summarizes the maturities of the company s significant financial obligations in thousands long term debt operating leases total fiscal year ending thereafter total the company expects to incur total expenses of approximately million in connection with the integration activities resulting from its merger with mykrolis  of which approximately was recorded in fiscal entegris expects that integration process following the merger will ultimately provide annualized cost savings of approximately million 
the company expects these cost synergies to be fully in place by the middle of calendar year as of august   under the lease terms relating to the vacated bedford  massachusetts facility  the company had an option to purchase the facility at fair market value between june and november  the expiration date of the lease  and the lessor had the option to sell the facility to the company at of the then current fair market value prior to november  in november  pursuant to a release and termination agreement  the company paid the lessor thousand in consideration of lessor s release and termination of its option under the lease 
the company s unsecured revolving credit agreement  which expires in may  allows for aggregate borrowings of up to million with interest at eurodollar rates plus 
under the unsecured revolving credit agreement  the company is subject to  and is in compliance with  certain financial covenants requiring a leverage ratio of not more than to 
in addition  the company must maintain a calculated consolidated tangible net worth  which  as of august   was million  while also maintaining consolidated aggregate amounts of cash and cash equivalents which under the agreement may also include auction rate securities classified as short term investments of not less than million 
at august   the company s shareholders equity stood at  million  up million from million at the beginning of the year 
this increase was primarily due to the merger with mykrolis  but also included the company s net earnings  and the proceeds and tax benefits associated with shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
on june   the company announced that it had filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
as amended  up to million shares of the company s common stock may be offered from time to time under the registration statement  including million newly issued shares by entegris and million currently outstanding shares by certain shareholders of the company 
the company stated that it would use the net proceeds from any future sale of new entegris shares for general corporate purposes or to finance acquisitions 
the company would not receive any proceeds from any sale of shares by the selling shareholders 
the shelf registration statement became effective as of may  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and investment requirements for the next months 
however  future growth  including potential acquisitions  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris principal financial market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s interest bearing cash equivalents and short term investments  and long term debt and short term borrowings are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
most of its long term debt at august  carries fixed rates of interest 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are debt instruments with maturities of months or less 
a basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease annual net income by approximately million annually 
the cash flows and earnings of the company s foreign based operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign based operations 
at august   the company was party to forward contracts to deliver japanese yen  taiwanese dollars and euros with notional values of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would potentially result in exchange gains or losses that would increase or decrease net income by approximately million 
impact of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of certain polymers  its primary raw material  increased over from one year ago 
entegris expects the cost of resins to increase in the upcoming fiscal year due to pricing surcharges implemented by some suppliers based on rising oil prices 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits rose slightly in fiscal and moderate increases also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal the company s products are sold under contractual arrangements with our large customers and at current market prices to other customers 
consequently  the company can adjust its selling prices  to the extent allowed by competition and contractual arrangements  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
however  all of these cost increases may not be recoverable 
factors and uncertainties that may affect future results the matters discussed in this annual report on form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include but are not limited to statements about our strategy  our revenues  sufficiency of our cash resources  product development  our research and development and other expenses  and our operations and legal risks 
discussions containing these forward looking statements may be found throughout this report including in business and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as any amendments thereto reflected in subsequent filings with the sec 
these statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
when used herein or in such statements  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  will  should or the negative thereof and similar expressions as they relate to entegris or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this annual report on form k except as required by law 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future operating results include the risk factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k as well as the following risks relating to our business and industry the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  and industry downturns reduce revenue and profits 
our business depends on the purchasing patterns of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated demand for semiconductors and products utilizing semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns  which often have resulted in decreased expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
this cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline significantly from one period to the next 
the cyclicality of our sales is illustrated by the following during the industry downturn that began in fiscal  entegris minnesota revenues declined significantly for three consecutive quarters from a high of million in the second quarter of to a low of million in the first quarter of  similarly mykrolis sales for were million  an increase of million over mykrolis net sales for were million slightly up from sales of million  but representing a decline of million  or from net sales in mykrolis net sales for were million  representing a million  or  decline from our net sales in furthermore  even in periods of reduced demand  we must continue to maintain a satisfactory level of research and development expenditures and continue to invest in our infrastructure 
at the same time  we have to manage our operations to be able to respond to significant increases in demand 
in addition  because we typically do not have significant backlog  changes in order patterns have a more immediate impact on our revenues 
we expect the semiconductor industry to continue to be cyclical 
any future downturns will reduce revenue and possibly increase pricing pressure  affecting both gross margin and net income 
such fluctuations in our results could cause our share price to decline substantially 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to predict 
as a result  our inability to meet demand in response to these rapid shifts may cause a reduction in our market share 
our ability to increase sales of our products  particularly our capital equipment products  depends in part upon our ability to ramp up the use of our manufacturing capacity for such products in a timely manner and to mobilize our supply chain 
in order to meet the demands of our customers  we may be required to ramp up our manufacturing capacity in as little as a few months 
if we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or manage such expansion effectively  our customers could seek such products from other suppliers  and our market share could be reduced 
because demand shifts in the semiconductor industry are rapid and difficult to foresee  we may not be able to increase capacity quickly enough to respond to such an increase in demand 
our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of rapid demand shifts and our insignificant level of backlog and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our securities may decrease significantly 
our sales and profitability can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term  an unanticipated decline in revenue in a particular quarter could disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter 
in addition  we make a substantial portion of our shipments shortly after we receive the order  and therefore we operate with an insignificant level of backlog 
as a consequence of the just in time nature of shipments and the low level of backlog  our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products 
we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 
such fluctuations in our results could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our securities to decline substantially 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance 
we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our products 
as noted above  we typically operate our business on a just in time shipment basis with a low level of backlog and we order supplies and plan production based on internal forecasts of demand 
due to these factors  we have  in the past  and may again in the future  fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  in terms of both volume and specific products for which there will be demand 
this has lead to  and may in the future lead to  delays in product shipments  disappointment of customer expectations  or  alternatively  an increased risk of excess inventory and of inventory obsolescence 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
semiconductor industry up cycles may not reach historic levels but instead may reflect a lower rate of long term growth  similar to the electronics industry 
notwithstanding the severe and prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry and the related reduction in manufacturing operations during the period to  there may still be excess manufacturing capacity 
in addition  there is no new high opportunity application to drive growth in the semiconductor industry  as was the case in with telecommunications and internet applications 
accordingly  some analysts have predicted that the semiconductor industry may experience lower growth rates during a recovery cycle than has historically been the case and that its longer term performance may reflect this lower growth rate  which would be similar to the growth rate of the electronics industry 
if we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in design and manufacturing processes  we will not be able to successfully compete 
the microelectronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions 
because of this  the life cycle of our products is difficult to determine 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and provide products that meet the changing needs of our customers  including the transition from the use of millimeter wafers to millimeter wafers  the shrinking of integrated circuit line widths and the use of new classes of materials  such as copper  titanium nitride and organic and inorganic dielectric materials  which are materials that have either a low or high resistance to the flow of electricity 
this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes in a cost effective and timely manner 
any inability to develop the technical specifications for any of our new products or enhancements to our existing products or to manufacture and ship these products or enhancements in volume in a timely manner could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our sales 
in addition  if new products have reliability or quality problems  we may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance and payment  additional service and warranty expense and damage to our reputation 
because our sales are concentrated on a small number of key customers  our revenue and profitability may materially decline if one or more of our key customers do not continue to purchase our existing and new products in significant quantities 
we depend and expect to continue to depend on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our business  and changes in several customers orders could have had a significant impact on our operating results 
if any one of our key customers decides to purchase significantly less from us or to terminate its relationship with us  our revenue and profitability may decline significantly 
we could also lose our key customers or significant sales to our key customers because of factors beyond our control  such as a significant disruption in our customers businesses generally or in a specific product line 
these customers may stop incorporating our products into their products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty for doing so 
in addition  if any of our customers merge  we may experience lower overall sales from the merged companies 
because one of our strategies has been to develop long term relationships with a few key customers in the product areas in which we focus and because we have a long product design and development cycle for most of our products and prospective customers typically require lengthy product qualification periods prior to placing volume orders  we may be unable to replace these customers quickly or at all 
because we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties and many of our costs are fixed  any significant changes  cancellations or deferrals of orders or shipments could cause our revenue and profitability to decline or fluctuate 
as is typical in the microelectronics industry  we do not usually obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from our customers 
instead  we work closely with our customers to develop non binding forecasts of the future volume of orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for reasons beyond our control 
order cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold inventory for longer than anticipated  which could reduce our profitability  restrict our ability to fund our operations and cause us to incur unanticipated reductions or delays in our revenue 
our customers often change their orders multiple times between initial order and delivery 
such changes usually relate to quantities or delivery dates  but sometimes relate to the specifications of the products we are supplying 
if a customer does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income 
in addition  our profitability may be affected by the generally fixed nature of our costs 
because a substantial portion of our costs is fixed  we may experience deterioration in gross margins when volumes decline 
from time to time  we make capital investments in anticipation of future business opportunities 
if we are unable to obtain the anticipated business  our revenue and profitability may decline 
competition from existing or new companies in the microelectronics industry could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete against many domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors may have more developed relationships with our existing customers than we do  which may enable them to have their products specified for use more frequently by these customers 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing 
as more original equipment manufacturers dispose of their manufacturing operations and increase the outsourcing of their products to liquid and gas delivery system and other component companies  we may face increasing competitive pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share 
if we are unable to maintain our competitive position  we could experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of market share 
competition in the semiconductor and data storage materials integrity management fields could intensify  which may limit our ability to maintain and increase our market share and raise prices 
we face substantial competition from a number of companies  some of which have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing and technical resources 
larger providers of materials integrity management solutions and products could emerge  with potentially broader product lines 
larger competitors could spend more time and resources on research and development  which could give those competitors an advantage in meeting customer demand 
we expect that existing and new competitors will improve the design of their existing products and will introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics 
the introduction of new products or more efficient production of existing products by our competitors could diminish our market share and increase pricing pressure on our products 
further  customers continue to demand lower prices  shorter delivery times and enhanced product capability 
if we do not respond adequately to such pressures  we could lose customers or orders 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we could experience pricing pressures  reduced gross margins and order cancellations 
lack of market acceptance of our mm products as well as our other products could harm our operating results 
the growing trend toward the use of mm wafers has contributed to the increasing complexity of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
the greater diameter of these wafers requires higher tooling costs and presents more complex handling  storage and transportation challenges 
we have made substantial investments to complete a full line of mm wafer manufacturing and handling product lines  but there is no guarantee that our customers will adopt our mm wafer manufacturing and handling product lines as they convert existing mm wafer fabrication facilities to mm wafer fabrication  or build new mm wafer fabrication facilities 
in addition  if the trend toward mm wafer manufacturing does not evolve as we anticipate  sales of our products for these applications would be minimal and we might not recover our development costs 
semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers may direct semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier s product in their equipment 
accordingly  our success depends in part on our ability to have semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers specify that our products be used at their fabrication facilities 
some of our competitors may have more developed relationships with semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers  which enable them to have their products specified for use in manufacturers fabrication facilities 
we may acquire other businesses  form joint ventures or divest businesses that could negatively affect our profitability  increase our debt and dilute your ownership of our company 
as part of our business strategy  we have  and we expect to continue to address gaps in our product offerings  diversify into complementary product markets or pursue additional technology and customers through acquisitions  joint ventures or other types of collaborations 
we also expect to adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our ongoing strategic objectives 
as a result  we may enter markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and may encounter difficulties in divesting businesses that no longer meet our objectives 
competition for acquiring attractive businesses in our industry is substantial 
in executing this part of our business strategy  we may experience difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or in completing selected transactions at appropriate valuations 
alternatively  we may be required to undertake multiple transactions at the same time in order to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that do arise  this could strain our ability to effectively execute and integrate these transactions 
we intend to pay for these acquisitions with cash and or our common stock which could impair our liquidity and dilute your ownership of our company 
further  we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we do make into our existing business operations and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from dilutive results from operations and or from future potential impairment of acquired assets including goodwill related to future acquisitions 
we may experience difficulties in operating in foreign countries or over significant geographical distances and in retaining key employees or customers of an acquired business  and our management s attention could be diverted from other business issues 
we may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis or at all  and we may not realize the benefits of any acquisition or joint venture 
we may be unable to successfully divest the operations that we have designated for divestiture 
on september  we announced our intention to divest our gas delivery  life science and tape and reel product lines 
if we are unable to successfully divest these operations in a prompt manner  we may have to continue to operate these product lines for a more extended period of time and we may not be able to recover the book value of the assets associated with these product lines 
if we are required to continue these operations our financial performance may be adversely impacted and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance 
risks associated with our merger we may be unable to successfully integrate our operations and realize the full cost savings from the merger that we anticipate 
the merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include the challenge of effecting integration while carrying on an ongoing business  the necessity of coordinating geographically separate organizations  retaining and integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and cultures  retaining existing customers and strategic partners of each company  and implementing and maintaining consistent standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the combined company s businesses and the loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the combined company 
among the factors considered by the entegris minnesota and mykrolis boards of directors in connection with their respective approvals of the merger agreement and the merger were the benefits of the more diversified product line  the broader customer base and the enhanced technology capabilities  as well as the potential cost savings  that are expected to result from the merger 
we cannot give you any assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time periods contemplated or at all 
we have and will continue to incur substantial costs and expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of our operations 
entegris minnesota and mykrolis have incurred substantial transaction costs related to the merger 
these costs included fees for financial advisors  attorneys and accountants  filing fees and financial printing costs 
in addition we expect that we will incur additional substantial expenses to integrate our operations and to achieve the cost saving that we expect from the merger 
these costs include severance expenses  costs of consultants and advisors related to the rationalization and combination of our benefit  compensation and incentive programs  the cost of such programs  facilities closure and relocation costs for certain manufacturing operations  and the costs of consolidating our information technology onto a single platform worldwide 
in addition  we expect to incur attorneys and accountants fees related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries worldwide and the divestiture of businesses that no longer fit within our combined enterprise 
manufacturing risks our dependence on single and limited source suppliers could affect our ability to manufacture our products 
we rely on single or limited source suppliers for some plastic polymers that are critical to the manufacturing of our products 
at times  we have experienced a limited supply of certain polymers as well as the need to substitute polymers  resulting in delays  increased costs and the risks associated with qualifying new polymers with our customers 
an industry wide increase in demand for these polymers could affect the ability of our suppliers to provide sufficient quantities to us 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate quantity of such supplies  our manufacturing operations may be interrupted 
in addition  suppliers may discontinue production of polymers specified in certain of our products  requiring us in some instances to certify an alternative with our customers 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate quantity of such supplies for any of the above reasons  our manufacturing operations may be affected 
obtaining alternative sources would likely result in increased costs and shipping delays  which could decrease profitability and damage our relationships with current and potential customers 
prices for polymers can vary widely 
in the current high oil price environment  some suppliers have added and may continue to add surcharges to the prices of the polymers we purchase 
while  we have long term arrangements with certain key suppliers of polymers that fixes our price for purchases up to specified quantities  if our polymer requirements exceed the quantities specified  we could be exposed to higher material costs 
if the cost of polymers increases and we are unable to correspondingly increase the sales price of our products  our profit margins will decline 
our production processes are becoming increasingly complex  and our production could be disrupted if we are unable to avoid manufacturing difficulties 
our manufacturing processes are complex and require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials 
these processes are frequently modified to improve manufacturing yields and product quality 
we have on occasion experienced manufacturing difficulties  such as temporary shortages of raw materials and occasional critical equipment breakdowns that have delayed deliveries to customers 
a number of our product lines are manufactured at only one or two facilities  and any disruption could impact our sales until another facility could commence or expand production of such products 
our manufacturing operations are subject to numerous risks  including the introduction of impurities in the manufacturing process that could lower manufacturing yields and make our products unmarketable  the costs and demands of managing and coordinating geographically diverse manufacturing facilities  and the disruption of production in one or more facilities as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in another facility 
we could experience these or other manufacturing difficulties  which might result in a loss of customers and exposure to product liability claims 
we may lose sales if we are unable to timely procure  repair or replace capital equipment necessary to manufacture many of our products 
if our existing equipment fails  or we are unable to obtain new equipment quickly enough to satisfy any increased demand for our products  we may lose sales to competitors 
in particular  we do not maintain duplicate tools for most of our important products 
fixing or replacing complex tools is time consuming  and we may not be able to replace a damaged tool in time to meet customer requirements 
in addition  from time to time we may upgrade or add new manufacturing equipment which may require substantial lead times to build and qualify 
delays in building and qualifying new equipment could result in a disruption of our manufacturing processes and prevent us from meeting our customers requirements so that they would seek other suppliers 
we incur significant cash outlays over long term periods in order to research  develop  manufacture and market new products  which may never reach market or may have limited market acceptance 
we make significant cash expenditures to research  develop and market new products 
for example  in fiscal we incurred million of engineering  research and development expense 
similarly  mykrolis incurred million of research and development expense in and million in  and entegris minnesota incurred million of engineering and research and development expense in fiscal and million in fiscal the development period for a product can be as long as five years 
following development  it may take an additional two to three years for the sales of that product to reach a substantial level 
we cannot be certain of the success of a new product 
a product concept may never progress beyond the development stage or may only achieve limited acceptance in the marketplace 
if this occurs  we do not receive a direct return on our expenditures and may not even realize any indirect benefits 
additionally  capacity expansion may be necessary in order to manufacture a new product 
if sales levels do not increase to offset the additional fixed operating expenses associated with any such expansion  our revenue and profitability could decline and our prospects could be harmed 
we currently use millipore s membrane manufacturing infrastructure  and our ability to meet our customer s demands will suffer if we do not successfully extend these arrangements or transition our membrane manufacturing operations to other facilities 
we have transition agreements in effect with millipore relating to the manufacture and distribution of specified membrane products for limited periods of time 
the manufacture of our membrane products is highly complex and requires sophisticated and costly equipment 
we are entitled to continue to manufacture membrane in millipore s plant until march of and we are engaged in negotiations to extend that agreement which we expect to conclude in the near future 
however  we might not be able to successfully extend these arrangements or successfully transition the membrane production to a different facility after that date 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our manufacturing facilities or any unforeseen delays in shifting membrane manufacturing operations to a new facility  whether due to technical or labor difficulties  destruction or damage to the facility or other reasons  could result in increased costs and reduced revenues and profitability and could harm our prospects 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
in addition to other regulatory requirements affecting our business  we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign regulatory requirements relating to the use  disposal  clean up of  and human exposure to  hazardous chemicals 
we generate and handle materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law 
if we fail to comply with any present or future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  compliance with these or future laws could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or build new facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment  incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes 
we are currently relocating certain manufacturing operations within our chaska minnesota plants and between chaska and our colorado springs and kulim  malaysia plants as well as consolidating our yonezawa  japan plants 
if we are unable to successfully manage these transfers  our ability to deliver product to our customers could be disrupted and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in order to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing operations we are moving several product lines from one of our chaska  mn plants to another and from our chaska plants to our colorado springs and kulim  malaysia plants as well as consolidating our yonezawa  japan plants 
these product lines involve technically complex manufacturing processes that require considerable expertise to operate 
if we are unable to complete these transfers in a systematic manner within established schedules or if we are unable to successfully operate these relocated manufacturing processes in the destination plant  production may be disrupted and we may not be able to deliver these products to meet customer orders in a timely manner  which could harm our business 
loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their experience in the microelectronics industry and their technological expertise 
similarly  our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
we depend on the services of our key senior executives and other technological experts because of their experience in the microelectronics industry and their technical expertise 
the loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically research and development and engineering personnel  could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
during the recent extended downturn in the semiconductor industry mykrolis had to impose salary reductions on our senior employees and freeze merit increases in an effort to maintain our financial position 
similarly  changes in accounting rules requiring fair value accounting for stock options will make it more expensive to provide our employees with equity incentives  which may require us to reduce the level of equity compensation 
these actions may have an adverse effect on employee loyalty and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key personnel 
in addition  our ability to successfully integrate acquired facilities or businesses depends  in part  on our ability to retain and motivate key management and employees hired by us in connection with the acquisition 
further  the process of integrating our operations pursuant to the merger has and will continue to result in reductions in force  if we are unable to successfully manage this process and maintain a stable work environment  we could lose employees with critical skills 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and prospects could be harmed 
our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal product families 
we rely  in part  on patent  trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology 
we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties 
we have obtained a number of patents relating to our products and have filed applications for additional patents 
we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will be approved  that we will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable  that any patents owned by or issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that these patents will not be challenged by third parties 
patent filings by third parties  whether made before or after the date of our filings  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property  and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise 
in addition  if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property  our competitiveness in international markets could be significantly impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenue 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not design around our patents 
protection of our intellectual property rights has and may continue to result in costly litigation 
we may from time to time be required to institute litigation in order to enforce our patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales  profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 
for example  on march  mykrolis filed a lawsuit against pall corporation in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging infringement of two of its us patents 
this lawsuit also sought a preliminary injunction preventing pall corporation from manufacturing  using  selling  offering for sale or importing into the united states the infringing product 
as of the date of filing this annual report on form k  the court has dissolved a preliminary injunction against pall and questioned the validity of the patents in suit 
mykrolis has appealed this ruling 
in addition  on june   entegris minnesota filed a lawsuit against miraial co 
ltd 
in the united states district court for the district of minnesota alleging the infringement  contributory infringement or inducement to infringe of five of its us patents relating to containers for transporting and storing silicon wafers use in the manufacture of semiconductors 
this lawsuit also sought a preliminary injunction preventing the defendant from directly infringing  infringing by inducement or contributing to the infringement of these patents 
see  item legal proceedings above for a full description of these lawsuits 
we have assumed both of these lawsuits pursuant to the merger and intend to prosecute them vigorously 
we expect that these lawsuits will continue for extended periods of time and that we will incur substantial costs in pursuing them 
if we infringe on the proprietary technology of others  our business and prospects could be harmed 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties 
if we are found to infringe or misappropriate a third party s patent or other proprietary rights  we could be required to pay damages to such third party  alter our products or processes  obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing such proprietary rights  including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights 
if we are required to obtain a license from a third party  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
international risks we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity and manufacturing efforts outside the united states  which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  of entegris minnesota s net sales in fiscal  and of entegris minnesota s net sales in we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a majority of our net sales 
in addition  a number of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets 
we also manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the united states and are dependent on international suppliers for many of our parts 
we intend to continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing internationally 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements that could impose additional costs on our operations or limit our ability to operate our business  greater difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable and longer payment cycles than is typical in domestic operations  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  liability for foreign taxes assessed at rates higher than those applicable to our domestic operations  and political and economic instability 
in the past  we have incurred costs or experienced disruptions due to the factors described above and expect to do so in the future 
for example  our operations in asia  and particularly korea  taiwan and japan  have been negatively impacted in the past as a result of regional economic instability  most recently in in addition  taiwan and korea account for a growing portion of the world s semiconductor manufacturing 
there are currently strained relations between china and taiwan and there are continuing tensions between north korea and south korea and the united states 
any adverse developments in those relations could significantly disrupt the worldwide production of semiconductors  which would lead to reduced sales of our products 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower net income or may cause us to raise prices  which could result in reduced net sales 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar could require us to increase prices to foreign customers  which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers 
alternatively  if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations  our profitability could decline 
in addition  sales made by our foreign subsidiaries will be denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold  and the currency we receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt versus the time of sale as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
an increased concentration of wafer manufacturing in japan could result in lower sales of our wafer shipper products 
a large percentage of the world s mm wafer manufacturing currently takes place in japan 
our market share in japan is currently lower than in other regions we serve 
during fiscal  entegris minnesota expanded its manufacturing capabilities in japan in order to improve its market share 
if we are not able to successfully operate our manufacturing capability and increase market share in japan  we might not be able to maintain our global market share in wafer shipper products  especially if mm wafer manufacturing in japan increases 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate and hurt our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
our primary facilities include headquarters  research and development and manufacturing facilities in the united states  sales  research and development and manufacturing facilities in japan and malaysia  and sales and service facilities in europe and asia 
also these attacks have disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels for our facilities 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and may ultimately affect the sales of our products in the united states and overseas 
as a result of terrorism the united states may enter into additional armed conflicts  which could have a further impact on our domestic and international sales  our supply chain  our production capacity and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
the consequences of these armed conflicts and instability are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business and your investment 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our securities because of the past volatility of the stock price of entegris minnesota and mykrolis  the price of our common stock in the future may likewise be volatile so that the ability to trade our common shares may be adversely affected and our ability to raise capital through future equity financing may be reduced 
the stock prices of both entegris minnesota and mykrolis have been volatile in the past and the price of our common stock may be volatile in the future 
for example in fiscal year  entegris minnesota s stock price ranged from to per share and mykrolis stock price ranged from to  in fiscal  entegris minnesota s stock price ranged from to per share and mykrolis stock price ranged from to per share 
the trading price of our common shares is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including factors discussed elsewhere in this report and including the following the failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  press releases or announcements by  or changes in market values of  comparable companies  volatility in the markets for high technology stocks  general stock market price and volume fluctuations  which are particularly common among securities of high technology companies  stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels  additions or departures of key personnel  and involvement in or adverse results from litigation 
these market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease 
recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of that act  the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq have promulgated new rules and listing standards covering a variety of subjects 
compliance with these new rules and listing standards has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
likewise  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly independent directors  or qualified executive officers 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement 
for example  during the fiscal year end audit  a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting was identified described below 
this material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of compensation expense  which was identified and corrected prior to the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this material weakness represents more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected 
the impact of this adjustment did not require the restatement of any of our financial statements 
management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august  in making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting  management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
in performing this assessment  the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of august  was identified we did not have effective policies and procedures  or personnel with sufficient knowledge of accounting for compensation related matters in purchase accounting transactions  to ensure that such transactions were accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
specifically  our policies and procedures did not provide for effective identification of  and consideration of  terms in compensation arrangements that impact the accounting for compensation arrangements 
based on the material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting described above  management has concluded that  as of august   the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria set forth by the coso of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
any failure to implement and maintain the improvements in the controls over our financial reporting  or difficulties encountered in the implementation of these improvements in our controls  could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
any failure to improve our internal controls to address the identified material weakness could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations and could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
with the commencement of effectiveness of the requirement that employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be treated as a compensation expense using the fair value method  we will incur significant compensation charges and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
our shareholder rights plan will permit our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount upon the occurrence of specified events  including the acquisition by anyone of or more of our common stock  unless such event is approved by our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our common stock could suffer 
your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock  which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote 
subject to applicable nasdaq standards  our board of directors has the authority  without action or vote of our stockholders  to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares 
issuances of common stock or the exercise of employee and director stock options would dilute your percentage ownership interest  which will have the effect of reducing your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote 
in addition  we may issue substantial quantities of our common stock in order to effect acquisitions which will also dilute your ownership interest 
if the issuances are made at prices that reflect a discount from the then current trading price of our common stock  your interest in the book value of our common stock might be diluted
