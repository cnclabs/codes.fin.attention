item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statement  including those discussed in forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in these statements  including risks and uncertainties discussed under factors that may affect future operating results 
overview micro linear corporation is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in wireless integrated circuit solutions  which enable a variety of wireless products serving a global market 
these transceivers can be used in many streaming wireless applications such as cordless phones  phs handsets  wireless speakers and headphones  security cameras  game controllers  cordless headsets and other personal electronic appliances 
headquartered in san jose  california  micro linear s products are available through its authorized representatives and distributors worldwide 
we were founded in  and until we were a supplier of advanced analog and mixed signal integrated circuits to the computer  communications  telecommunications  consumer and industrial markets 
during  we divested our manufacturing test operation and our non communication product lines and focused our marketing  engineering and product development on new communications products  including some wired networking products  but most notably wireless integrated circuits 
during  we established 
table of contents ourselves as a volume supplier of rf transceivers to the digital cordless telephone segment of the communications market 
wireless product revenue represented of net revenue for compared to of net revenue for we expect the revenue contribution from wireless products to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
in october  we announced that in order to better align our product development activities with our revenue producing markets  we would stop development of a broadband wireless products 
the realignment process included redirecting certain engineering activities  and reorganizing sales  marketing and applications to strengthen major account support 
as part of the realignment  we reduced our workforce by employees 
on may   we undertook a restructuring effort that eliminated approximately additional positions in all operational segments of the company  and consolidated some functions at our san jose headquarters 
opportunities and challenges our operating results are likely to continue to fluctuate as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to the level  timing  cancellation or rescheduling of customer orders  changes in market demand  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and cost  market acceptance of our products  economic conditions specific to the networking and wireless industries and markets  and general economic conditions 
as a result of competitive pricing pressures we may experience lower margins in our wireless products  and we expect these pricing pressures to continue 
in addition  the wireless and computer networking markets have undergone a period of rapid growth and consolidation in recent years 
although sales of our legacy networking products continue to decline as expected  we are still dependent on sales to computer network equipment manufacturers to continue 
as a result  our business would suffer in the event of a significant slowdown in the networking equipment market 
we intend to try to offset this decline in networking revenue by continuing to introduce new wireless products 
the wireless and computer equipment networking markets in which we compete are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
to address these challenges  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability  are cost effective  and brought to market in a timely manner 
sales to one wireless customer  uniden corporation uniden  represented of our total revenue during and we expect will represent a significant portion of our revenue during we are dependent on our relationship with uniden and as a result our business would also suffer in the event of a significant slowdown in uniden s business 
successful engineering development and market penetration in the product areas we have chosen require high levels of engineering and product development expense 
we have sometimes experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
as we do not currently manufacture our own semiconductor wafers  we are vulnerable to process technology advances competitors use to manufacture products offering higher performance and lower cost 
to address these challenges  we intend to pursue various opportunities 
for example  we intend to continue to spend significant amounts of resources on new product and technology development  predominately wireless semiconductors 
we intend to broaden our markets into many streaming wireless applications such as phs transeivers  wireless speakers and headphones  security cameras  game controllers  cordless headsets and cordless telephones 
we also intend to leverage our existing intellectual property in the development of new products to reduce technical risk and development cycle time and to develop customer and strategic relationships in our target markets to strengthen our competitive position 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product shipped directly to oem customers at the time of shipment  provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
sales to our oem customers are made without return privileges and revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment 
we defer recognition of revenue from sales of our products to distributors under agreements which allow certain rights of return and price adjustments on unsold inventory 
the associated cost of product on these sales to distributors is also deferred and included in our inventory balances 
revenue and cost of product is recognized when the distributor resells the product to its customers 
some sales to distributors are below contract pricing and are not guaranteed price protection or return privileges 
on these sales  we do not defer revenue 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for expected product returns 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
there were no allowances for returns recorded at december  estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of accrued liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the customer  as determined by an evaluation of the customer s financial statements  credit rating  bank and credit references 
we do not generally require collateral from the customer 
for certain international customers  we obtain letters of credit or cash payments in advance of shipment 
allowances for potential credit losses are established based on management s review of individual accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  an unexpected change in a major customer s ability to meet its obligation could have an adverse material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory we value inventories at the lower of standard cost or market 
standard costs are adjusted to approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
the value of inventories is reduced by an estimated allowance for 
table of contents excess and obsolete inventories 
this allowance for excess and obsolete inventories is based upon our review of demand for our products in light of projected sales  current market conditions  and market trends 
if a significant  unanticipated decrease in demand for our products or significant technological development occurs  we may deem it necessary to provide for additional inventory reserves  which may have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
for inventory for which a reserve is provided  we do not release the reserve until the inventory is sold or otherwise disposed of 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax planning strategies and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  it is reflected as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or release existing allowances  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in the third quarter of  we completed an impairment review of our land and buildings 
the review was undertaken due to continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets  local vacancy rates and recent real estate transactions in our local market 
upon completion of our review  we determined that the carrying values of these assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million to write down the assets to their current estimated market value 
in july  we sold our san jose facilities for approximately million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately million and the sale generated cash of approximately million  net of a million mortgage payoff and million of closing costs 
in fiscal year  we wrote down of impaired capitalized software primarily due to the discontinuation of the a broadband wireless program 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  an amendment to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and statement on financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
the revised standard addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic 
table of contents method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of income 
sfas no 
r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows  but does not require  companies to restate the full fiscal year of to reflect the impact of expensing share based payments under sfas no

the company has not yet determined which fair value method and transitional provision it will follow 
currently  we disclose the pro forma net income loss and related pro forma income loss per share information in accordance with sfas and statement on financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
will be effective for nonmonetary transactions in fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations revenue we recognize revenue from product shipped directly to oem customers at the time of shipment 
sales to our oem customers are made without return privileges 
during  our top ten oem customers collectively accounted for approximately of net revenue 
we defer recognition of revenue and costs of our products to distributors until the distributor resells the product to its customers 
however  some sales to distributors are below contract pricing and are not guaranteed price protection or return privileges 
on these sales  we do not defer revenue 
sales to uniden  our largest customer  pass through an international distributor  and are recognized as revenue upon the distributor s resale to the end customer 
however  these sales are classified as oem in our percent of net revenue presentation  since the distributor does not fulfill a traditional distributor stocking role for this customer 
in  sales through domestic distributors represented of net revenue 
total international sales through international distributors  exclusive of sales to uniden  represented of net revenue

we expect erosion in average selling prices of our wireless products over the coming year as our ml and ml products mature 
net revenue from our networking products decreased significantly  as expected  due mainly to the continuing fall off in the demand for our legacy networking products as they approach end of life 
unit shipments of our networking products decreased during as compared to  and the average selling prices of these products decreased in as compared to due to a shift in product mix 
we expect that the average selling prices of networking products will stabilize over the coming year but we 
table of contents anticipate that the erosion in demand for our legacy networking products will continue  resulting in lower networking product revenue 
net revenue for decreased as compared to net revenue for wireless product revenue decreased in as compared to despite a increase in unit shipments during as we experienced significant price erosion in our volume ghz product  the ml the decrease due to the price erosion experienced in was offset only slightly by an increase in volume shipments 
international revenue for totaled million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  for  and million  or of net revenue  for domestic revenue was approximately of net revenue for  compared to for and for we expect that international revenue will continue to account for the substantial majority of our total revenue in in fiscal  uniden corporation and giant electronics limited a subcontractor for plantronics accounted for and of net revenue  respectively 
in fiscal and  uniden corporation accounted for of net revenue 
although our strategy is to engage large customers for new design wins  we expect that uniden corporation will continue to be our largest customer during the next twelve months 
gross margin change change to to in thousands gross margin of net revenue gross margin is affected by the unit volume of product shipments  selling prices  product mix  manufacturing subcontract costs  manufacturing utilization  and product yields 
it is also periodically affected by costs incurred in connection with start up and installation of new process technologies at outside manufacturing foundries and test subcontractors 
gross margin is also affected by increases in inventory provisions required for excess and obsolete inventories 
our gross margin for increased over  despite being negatively impacted during the year due to million in charges for write downs in inventory related to excess quantities of certain of our legacy networking products and certain wireless products 
gross margin for wireless products was for as compared to for and gross margin for networking products was for as compared to for the increase in wireless product gross margin was primarily due to the increase in average selling prices and a decrease in direct unit product costs 
the growth in our average selling prices was driven primarily by sales of our ml  which began shipping in volume during the second quarter of the decrease in our direct unit product cost during was primarily due to our ability to maintain high yields in the manufacture of our ml product and our ability to achieve high yields on our ml  which we began producing in volume during the third quarter of comparatively  during  wireless product gross margin was negatively impacted by continued significant erosions in average selling prices and higher unit product costs due to the low yields on the ml  our ghz wireless product that was shipping in high volumes during during we incurred million in charges due to increases in our inventory provisions for certain legacy wireless products 
these charges impacted the wireless product gross margin by in sales of previously written down wireless inventories were not significant during the networking product gross margin percentage decreased percentage points during this decrease in margin was mainly due to a decrease of in the average selling prices of these products  resulting primarily from a shift in product mix 
the decrease in networking product average selling prices was offset partially by a decrease in direct unit product costs 
during we incurred million in charges due to increases in our inventory provisions for certain legacy networking products 
these charges impacted 
table of contents the networking product gross margin by in sales of previously written down networking inventories were million in these sales increased the gross margin of networking products by during production overhead costs increased in as compared to  driven primarily by production start up costs at two of our test subcontractors in production overhead costs represented of total product costs in  up from of total product costs in we expect that production overhead costs will decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue over the coming year 
the decrease in gross margin in  compared to  resulted mainly from the decrease in the average selling prices of our wireless products and to a lesser extent the shift in product mix of our networking products 
the margin decreases were slightly offset by decreases in manufacturing subcontract costs realized through a combination of a decrease in the costs of our silicon wafers and efficiencies realized in the costs to test our products 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted in by low yields on our ml product that was shipping in high volume  in the second and third quarters 
these manufacturing problems were identified and fixed during the fourth quarter of during we incurred million in charges due to increases in our inventory provisions for certain legacy wireless products 
these charges impacted the wireless product gross margin by in sales of previously written down inventories were not significant during fixed manufacturing overhead spending decreased by million in as compared to but remained at of net revenue in both of these periods due to the overall decrease in revenue in as compared to research and development expenses r d change change to to in thousands r d research and development expenses include costs associated with the definition  design and development of new products 
in addition  research and development expenses include test development and prototype costs associated with new product development 
we expense wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized  support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
research and development costs decreased in as compared to  a total cost reduction of million 
employee related costs  consisting mainly of wages and benefits  decreased million  and facility expenses decreased by approximately million  due mainly to the action taken to reduce engineering headcount and consolidate facilities as part of our overall restructuring efforts undertaken in may in addition  costs of laboratory equipment and software design tools decreased slightly over million in as compared to  mainly due to a reduction in depreciation expense and amortization on capitalized software  also resulting from our may restructuring efforts  and a renegotiation of certain software license agreements 
these cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in other costs of million  primarily related to development of new products 
the decrease in our expenses compared to was mainly due to our restructuring efforts implemented in may we reduced engineering headcount as part of these restructuring efforts and consolidated most of the design and testing activities in our san jose headquarters and a small design group located in salt lake city  utah 
we expect to continue spending significant funds on research and development activities to deliver leading edge products that have a promise of high volume shipments within a short time following their introduction 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a change change to to in thousands sg a the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in compared to was due mainly to a million reduction in employee related expenses resulting from the restructuring that we undertook in the second quarter of and million in reduced marketing prototype costs in compared to the reduction in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in our bad debt expense of million in compared to  an increase in consulting expenses of million resulting primarily from our sarbanes oxley act section implementation project  and an increase in travel expenses of million related to the introduction of new products 
the decrease of million in selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to  was primarily a result of the restructuring efforts we undertook in may and the associated headcount reductions across all selling  general and administrative functions 
these cost reductions were offset somewhat by the increase in costs associated with marketing prototypes for new products 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase over the coming year as we incur higher consulting  auditing and legal expenses related to the cost of complying with the sarbanes oxley act 
fixed asset impairment  restructuring charges and sale of land and buildings in the third quarter of  we completed an impairment review of our land and buildings 
the review was undertaken due to an unsolicited offer to purchase our facilities  continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets  local vacancy rates and recent real estate transactions in our local market 
upon completion of our review  we determined that the carrying values of these assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million to write down the assets to their current estimated market value 
in july  we sold our san jose facilities for approximately million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately million and the sale generated cash of approximately million  net of a million mortgage payoff and million of closing costs 

table of contents in the second quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan to better align our organizational structure with current business conditions 
this realignment process included workforce reductions across all functions of the company s operations and a consolidation of our design centers into our san jose facility 
the activity in our restructuring reserve  consisting of restructuring charges and related utilization  for the fiscal year ended december  is shown in the table below 
in we provided million for our remaining lease obligations  net of expected sublease payments  on our utah facility which we vacated in the first quarter of when these facilities were vacated  the related accrued rent was reclassified to our restructuring reserves 
the remaining balance of the reserve relates to our continuing charges for rent and leased equipment obligations 
severance excess and benefits facilities total in thousands balance  december  additional provisions utilizations balance  december  additional provisions reclassification utilizations balance  december  we recorded restructuring charges in of approximately million  consisting primarily of employee severance and related termination costs of million and a fixed asset impairment charge of million for assets to be disposed of due to headcount reductions and vacating facilities 
we did not maintain any restructuring reserves at the beginning of but had a  ending reserve balance to provide for employee severance costs that had been incurred but not paid during during we recognized million in asset impairment charges relating to capitalized software that was purchased specifically for our a development project that was cancelled in october interest and other income and interest expense change change to to in thousands interest and other income interest and other expense the decrease in interest and other income from to and from to was primarily due to the reduction in interest income affected by changes in our cash balances 
the decrease in interest and other expense from to is mainly due to the repayment of the mortgage on our san jose facility  which was repaid in july when the property was sold 
provision benefit for income taxes change change to to in thousands our effective tax rate was for  for and a tax benefit for the provision for the twelve months ended december  consists mainly of minimum state tax obligations and minor taxes incurred by our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
the effective tax rate for is primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset as of december  and taxes 
table of contents associated with our uk operations 
the effective rate for is primarily due to tax refunds resulting from a tax law change in that allowed us to carryback net operating losses to prior years 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities cash used by operating activities during was due mainly to our net operating loss of million  which was net of a gain of million from the sale of our san jose facilities in july excluding this gain our net operating loss was million 
our major uses of cash are operating expenses and cost of product manufactured 
during the major additional uses of cash were an increase of accounts receivable of million  due primarily to higher sales in december as compared to  and a decrease of million in our trade payables at december  as compared to we expect trade payable balances to continue to fluctuate from period to period due to variations in our production cycle and timing of other operating expenses 
these uses were partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million  and the inventory provision charge of million 
cash used in operating activities during was primarily due to our million net loss  offset by a non recurring non cash charge of million recorded for impairment in the value of our san jose facilities  non cash restructuring charges of million  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million 
in addition  during we collected million in income tax refunds due to net operating loss carrybacks that were recorded in cash used in operating activities during also included cash provided by an increase in our accounts payable balances of million  million of which related to a customer refund due for products which were returned in december 
these favorable cash items were offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of million due primarily to lower stocking levels at our largest distributor and a million decrease in accrued liabilities due in large part to a decrease in a legal accrual related to the successful outcome of the pioneer magnetics litigation 
cash used in operating activities during was primarily due to our net loss of million 
the net loss included a million tax benefit primarily due to the carryback of net operating losses to profitable years  million of which was received in tax refunds in other components of operating cash flows for  and are set forth in detail in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
net cash provided by or used in investing activities net cash provided during included net proceeds from the sale of our san jose facilities 
the net sales price for the facilities was million and we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately million 
the sale generated cash of approximately million after the payoff of the remaining balance on the mortgage of million and payment of sales commission and sales transaction costs of million 
we also generated cash from the net proceeds from sales of short term investments of million  and used million to purchase capital equipment consisting mainly of engineering equipment and software design tools used in research and development projects 
capital expenditures for this type of equipment are expected to stay near levels in the coming year and we anticipate that we will be able to provide for these expenditures without any additional sources of financing 

table of contents net cash provided by used in investing activities during and consisted primarily of net proceeds from sales purchases of short term investments 
in  cash used for capital expenditures increased to million compared to million in net cash provided by or used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities for  and consists primarily of principal payments on our real estate mortgage of million  million and million  respectively  offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options of million  million  and million  respectively 
the mortgage on our san jose facilities was paid off when the buildings were sold during contractual obligations by year in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years inventory commitment operating and facility leases total working capital was million at december   including cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
we anticipate that existing cash resources will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment  and provide adequate working capital for at least the next months 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  including  among others  the extent to which we pursue additional wafer fabrication capacity from existing foundry suppliers or new suppliers  capital expenditures  the level of our product development efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us 
factors that may affect future operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected our operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly 
they may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results are difficult to predict and have fluctuated significantly in the past 
they are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level and timing of spending by our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  including seasonal and cyclical fluctuations  timing  amount  cancellation or rescheduling of customer orders  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  timing of revenue recognition from contracts  which may span several quarters  competitive market conditions  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products by us  or competitors  or both  
table of contents any delay in the introduction of new or enhanced products by us  market acceptance of our new products and continuing demand for our existing products  cost and availability of wafers  other components and testing services  mix of products sold  fluctuations in end user demand for wireless products manufactured by our customers which incorporate our technology  economic conditions specific to the networking and wireless industries and markets  as well as general economic conditions  ability to hire and retain qualified technical and other personnel  development of new industry standard communication protocols  and availability and performance of advanced silicon process technologies from foundry sources 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our operating results in one or more future periods fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate  possibly by a significant amount 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive  and many competitors are larger and more established 
if we do not compete successfully  our business could be harmed 
intense international and domestic competition  decreasing selling prices  rapid technological change  short product life cycles and cyclical patterns characterize the markets for our products 
competitors include significantly larger corporations 
new entrants in these markets could provide additional competition 
most of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in spending by customers in these markets 
they often have broader product lines and market focus  and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market 
in addition  many competitors have focused on the wireless market for longer than we have  and therefore have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers 
the computer networking equipment and wireless markets have undergone a period of rapid growth and consolidation in recent years 
we expect our dependence on sales to digital cordless phone and network equipment manufacturers to continue 
our business and results of operations would be harmed in the event of a significant slowdown in the digital cordless phone or computer networking equipment market 
in addition  as a result of competitive pricing pressures  we have experienced lower margins on some of our products 
such pricing pressures will continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations  and our business could suffer unless they can be offset by higher margins on other products or lower operating expenses 
we do not currently manufacture our own semiconductor wafers 
as a result  we are vulnerable to process technology advances competitors use to manufacture products offering higher performance and lower cost 
larger companies with wafer manufacturing facilities  broader product lines  greater technical and financial resources and greater service and support capabilities have an advantage in this market 
in addition  our products are generally sole sourced to our customers 
if our customers were to develop other sources for our products  our operating results would be harmed 
the market for wireless applications is characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to these changes 
rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards make it difficult to accurately predict the market s future growth rate  size or technological direction 
in view of the evolving nature of this market  suppliers of wireless products may decide to adopt alternative standards or 
table of contents technologies that are incompatible with our products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that are compatible with these new standards or technologies  our business and operating results would be harmed 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to successfully compete in our industry 
continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards characterize the wireless and computer equipment networking markets 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability  meet performance or other objective specified parameters  are cost effective  are brought to market in a timely manner  are in accordance with existing or evolving industry standards  and achieve market acceptance 
the development of these new circuits is highly complex 
we have sometimes experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on many factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
we must be able to adjust to changing market conditions quickly and cost effectively to compete successfully 
furthermore  we must introduce new products in a timely manner  and achieve market acceptance for these products 
in addition  our customers products which incorporate our products must be introduced in a timely manner and achieve market acceptance 
if we  or our customers  fail to develop and introduce new products successfully  our business and operating results would suffer 
to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products  we may need to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
if we cannot enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  our ability to develop and market new products could suffer  and our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
customers typically take a long time to evaluate our new products 
it takes three to six months or more for customers to test new products  and at least an additional three to months until customers begin significant production of products incorporating our products 
we may therefore experience a lengthy delay between product development and the generation of revenue from new products 
delays inherent in such a long sales cycle raise additional risks that customers may decide to cancel or change their product plans 
such changes could result in the loss of anticipated sales 
our business  financial condition  and results of operations would suffer if customers reduce or delay orders  or choose not to release products incorporating our products 
we have a history of losses and  because of continued investment in product development  expect to incur losses in the future 
we may not become profitable 
we have incurred quarterly net losses from june through december  except for a profit in the third quarter of which was attributable to an income tax refund  and a profit in the third quarter of 
table of contents which occurred from the sale of our land and buildings 
because of those losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  successful engineering development and market penetration in the product areas we have chosen to compete in require high levels of engineering and product development expense 
we intend to continue to spend significant amounts on new product and technology development 
our networking products are reaching maturity  and revenue from this product line has declined and is expected to decline further over the next months 
we anticipate that our existing cash will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment  and provide adequate working capital for at least the next months 
we expect to incur losses in the future and may not achieve our goals of positive net income and cash flow 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional capital 
if funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to hire or retain employees  fund our operations or compete effectively 
we believe that our existing capital resources and cash generated from operations will enable us to maintain our operations for at least the next months 
however  if our capital requirements or results of operations vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms  our ability to hire  train or retain employees  to fund our operations and sales and marketing efforts  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on networking  wireless  and telecommunications spending for our revenue 
any decrease or delay in spending in these industries would negatively impact future operating results and financial condition 
demand for our products in the future will depend on the amount and timing of spending by network providers  manufacturers of wireless consumer products  and telecommunications equipment suppliers 
spending in these areas depends upon a variety of factors  including competitive pressures  discretionary consumer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
during and new orders slowed  customers cancelled or placed holds on existing orders  and orders dropped from prior periods  due to developments in the general economy and capital markets 
this situation could recur in the future 
because the majority of our revenue comes from sales to a few customers  a delay in orders from one customer could have a significant negative effect on future revenue 
relatively short product life cycles characterize the computer network equipment and digital cordless telephone markets 
if one or more of our significant customers were to select circuits manufactured by a competitor for future products  our business would suffer 
the loss of one or more of our current customers  failure to attract new customers  or disruption of our sales and distribution channels could harm our business and operating results 
our customer base is concentrated 
the loss of one or more key customers or distributors would harm our business 
a significant majority of our revenue comes from sales to relatively few customers 
sales to the ten largest customers  excluding domestic distributors  in   and accounted for approximately   and of net revenue  respectively 
sales to domestic distributors in   and accounted for approximately   and of net revenue 
we anticipate that a limited number of key customers and distributors will continue to provide a significant portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
during 
table of contents  two customers each accounted for more than of our net revenues  uniden corporation accounted for of our total sales and giant electronics limited a subcontractor for plantronics accounted for of our total sales 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our current customers and attract new customers 
a reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers could materially harm our operating results 
in addition  our operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to develop other sources for the products we now supply them 
generally  customers may cancel or reschedule orders to purchase standard products without significant penalty until days prior to requested shipment 
customers frequently revise delivery schedules  and the quantities of products to be delivered  to reflect changes in their needs 
since backlog can be canceled or rescheduled  our backlog at any time is not necessarily indicative of future revenue 
we depend on international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our business 
sales to customers outside of the united states in   and represented   and of net revenue  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to generate a substantial proportion of net revenue for the foreseeable future 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including changes in regulations and laws of foreign governments and telecommunications standards  import and export legislation and license requirements  tariffs  taxes  quotas and other trade barriers  compliance with foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulty in managing foreign operations  loss of one or more international distributors  geopolitical risks  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and economic instability  and political and economic instability  including wars  acts of terrorism  political unrest  boycotts and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide 
substantially all of our international sales must be licensed by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties in obtaining export licenses 
our international sales are typically denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  while competitors products denominated in local currencies become less expensive 
this may lead to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country  which could adversely affect our business 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other international assets and liabilities may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  international customers typically take longer to pay for purchases than customers in the united states 
if foreign markets do not continue to develop  or foreign sales cycles prove unpredictable  our revenue and business would be adversely affected 

table of contents selling prices for wireless products typically decrease  which could lead to lower operating results 
average selling prices for products in the wireless markets have rapidly declined due to many factors  including rapidly changing technologies  price performance enhancements  product introductions by competitors  price pressure from significant customers  and product maturity and obsolescence 
the decline in the average selling prices of our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
we continue to develop and market new products that incorporate valued new features and sell at higher prices 
failure to deliver new products offering increased value would result in a decline in both revenue and margins  harming our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
defects in our products  product returns and product liability could result in a decrease in customers and revenue  unexpected expenses and loss of market share 
complex products such as ours frequently contain errors  defects  and bugs upon release 
despite thorough testing by micro linear  our test houses and customers  these errors  defects and bugs are sometimes discovered after we begin to ship products 
we expend significant resources to remedy these problems  but occasionally have faced legal claims by customers and others 
product defects can also cause interruptions  delays or cancellations of sales to customers  in addition to claims against us  all of which could adversely affect our operating results 
we depend on the health of the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical 
the decline in demand in the semiconductor industry could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry experiences significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry also experiences significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this causes significant variances in product demand and production capacity  and aggravates both our manufacturing costs and product selling prices 
these cyclical patterns  which we expect to continue  may substantially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products  we may incur product shortages or excess product inventory 
we regularly request indications from customers as to their future plans and requirements  to ensure that we will be prepared to meet production demand for our products 
however  we may not receive anticipated purchase orders for our products 
we must be able to effectively manage the expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting potential demand 
if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we expend resources and purchase materials  or enter into commitments to acquire materials and manufacture products  and customers do not purchase these products  our business and operating results would suffer 
design wins  which require significant expenditures  often precede the generation of volume sales by a year or more 
the value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer s product  and on the extent to which the design of the customer s product accommodates components manufactured by our competitors 
we cannot assure that we will achieve design wins  or that any design win will result in significant future revenue 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of outside foundries and test subcontractors in the manufacturing process  and any failure to obtain sufficient foundry or testing capacity could significantly delay our ability to ship our products  damage our customer relationships  and result in reduced revenue 
we utilize outside foundries for all wafer production 
we believe that utilizing outside foundries enable us to focus on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and access diverse manufacturing technologies 
we currently intend to continue to rely exclusively upon our outside foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements 
however  there are significant risks associated with the reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of assured wafer supply and control over delivery schedules  delays in obtaining access to key process technologies  and limited control over manufacturing yields and production costs 
the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technically demanding process 
we have diversified our sources of wafer supply and have worked closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields 
however  our foundries have sometimes experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new processes 
reduced yields have  at times  negatively affected our operating results  a situation which may recur in the future 
dependence on foundries located outside of the united states subjects us to numerous risks  including exchange rate fluctuations  export and import restrictions  trade sanctions  political instability and tariff increases 
one of our main foundries is located in singapore  which presents specific risks due to political instability in that region 
we purchase wafers from outside foundries pursuant to customers purchase orders 
we generally do not have a guaranteed level of wafer capacity or wafer costs at our foundries 
our wafer suppliers could prioritize capacity for other uses  or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
in addition  we depend upon a limited number of foundries for our wafer requirements 
any sudden demand for an increased amount of wafers  or sudden reduction or elimination of any source of wafers  could result in a material delay in the shipment of products 
disruptions in supply  which have occurred in the past  may occur in the future 
if such a disruption occurred  and we were unable to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner  or if such sources were unable to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields  our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we rely on four outside test service subcontractors to test our products 
the same risks described in the paragraphs above  concerning guaranteed capacity  dependence upon a limited number of test service subcontractors  and disruptions in service  also apply to our test and assembly subcontractors 
rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions characterize the markets for our products 
to remain competitive  we must develop or obtain access to new semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce die size  increase die performance and functional complexity  and improve manufacturing yields 
if we are unable to obtain access to advanced wafer processing technologies  limiting our ability to introduce competitive products on a timely basis  our future operating results would be harmed 
minute levels of contaminants in the semiconductor manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process and other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these manufacturing problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming and expensive to remedy 
our foundries have  at times  experienced lower than anticipated yields  which have adversely affected production and operating results 
the manufacturing processes utilized by our foundries are continuously being improved in order to increase yield and product performance 
process changes can  however  result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields 
new process technologies and new products are especially susceptible to wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
irregularities  adverse yield fluctuations or other manufacturing problems at our foundries could result in production interruption or delivery delays  which would harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents we have granted nontransferable  limited process licenses to some of our foundries to utilize our processes to manufacture and sell wafers to other customers 
we protect our proprietary technology  particularly our design methodology  but may not be able to prevent its misappropriation by our foundries or others 
we and the independent foundries and subcontractors we use to manufacture and test our products are subject to environmental laws 
failure to comply with these laws could delay manufacturing of our products and result in unexpected expenses 
our wafer suppliers and test and assembly subcontractors are subject to a variety of us and foreign government regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in their manufacturing processes 
failure by our suppliers or subcontractors to comply with environmental regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
environmental regulations could also require our suppliers or subcontractors to acquire equipment or incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
if our suppliers or subcontractors incur substantial additional expenses  product costs could significantly increase  adversely affecting our results of operations 
we are also subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to our operations 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  the government could impose fines on us  or compel us to suspend or cease operations 
if we or our suppliers or subcontractors fail to control the use or discharge of hazardous substances  we could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities  which could harm our business and operating results 
because competition for qualified personnel is intense  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel  which could have an impact upon the development or sales of our products 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  especially those with engineering design experience and expertise 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such qualified personnel 
competitors may attempt to recruit our employees 
while employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we do not have employment contracts or non competition agreements with most of our personnel 
the loss of the services of key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  or delays in hiring personnel  particularly engineers and other technical personnel could negatively affect our business and prevent us from achieving our business goals 
our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we own eight us patents  and have nine us patent applications 
we own two foreign patents  and have foreign applications pending 
through a sale of a portion of our assets  we maintain a royalty free license to several us patents  foreign patents  us patent applications  and foreign patent applications 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures 
however  any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights we own may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
we cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages  or that any pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us 
competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate technological expertise and innovation into new and enhanced products 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology 

table of contents in addition  we have taken legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  and defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
if a third party makes a valid claim  and we cannot obtain a license to the technology on reasonable terms  our operations could be harmed 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of the proprietary rights and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming  and could divert our management s attention away from running our business 
we have in the past  and may in the future  be parties to legal proceedings that could have a negative financial impact on us 
from time to time we have received correspondence from vendors  distributors  customers or end users of our products regarding disputes with respect to contract rights  product performance or other matters that occur in the ordinary course of business 
some of these disputes may involve us in costly litigation or other actions  the outcome of which cannot be determined in advance and may adversely affect our business 
the defense of lawsuits or other actions could divert our management s attention away from running our business 
in addition  negative developments with respect to litigation could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile because of stock market fluctuations that affect the price of technology stocks 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us  which could divert management s attention and harm our business 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
between january  and december   our stock price has traded as high as on january   and as low as on december  our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements about us or about our competitors  including technological innovation or new products  litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the computer networking equipment and wireless markets  governmental regulation and legislation  and changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the objects of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a change in control  even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  the shareholder rights plan  our stock option plans and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
under the shareholder rights plan  adopted in august  each share of our outstanding common stock carries one right to purchase of a share of series a participating preferred stock at an exercise price of per right 
if someone acquires or more of our common stock  each right not owned by a holder of or more of our common stock entitles the holder  upon payment of the exercise price  to receive common stock having a current market value of 
this issuance of additional common stock would significantly reduce the percentage of common stock held by a potential acquirer 
the rights expire in august in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of micro linear 
specifically  section prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless specific conditions are met 
also  in the event outstanding options granted pursuant to certain of our stock option plans are not assumed by an acquiring corporation  the unvested portion of such options may be accelerated upon a change of control 
in addition  some individual stock option grants provide for the partial or complete acceleration of vesting upon a change of control 
recently enacted regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the sec and nasdaq  could cause us to incur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements 
the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or as executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new and proposed rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations and cause us to change our business practices 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
changes to those rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  accounting policies affecting many aspects of our business  including rules relating to employee stock option grants  have recently been revised or are under review 
the financial accounting standards board and other agencies have finalized changes to us generally accepted accounting principles that will require us  starting in our third quarter of  to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives 
we may have significant and ongoing accounting charges resulting from option grant and other equity incentive expensing that could reduce our overall net income 
in addition  since we historically have used equity related compensation as a component of our total employee compensation program  the accounting change could 
table of contents make the use of equity related compensation less attractive to us and therefore make it more difficult to attract and retain employees 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting  we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
this legislation is relatively new and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in complying with its requirements 
as a result  we expect to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section compliance 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions of our company may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december  our investment portfolio consisted of us government obligations  commercial paper and money market funds  typically with maturities of less than months see note to the consolidated financial statements 
some of these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  and december   the fair market value of these investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
foreign currency exchange risk our international sales are significant in relation to our total sales  however  substantially all of our sales are in united states dollars 
we do maintain small amounts of foreign currencies to fund our international operations  but to date  our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant
