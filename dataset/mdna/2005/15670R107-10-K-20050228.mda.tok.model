our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the scope and timing of actual usps funding and deployment of the bds  the rate of environmental testing using the bds conducted by the usps  which will affect the amount of consumable products sold  whether the bds  as built  performs to specifications  development and manufacturing problems  including with respect to the genexpert system and reagents  the need for additional licenses for new tests and other products and the terms of such licenses  our ability to successfully commercialize our stand alone genexpert system  our ability to successfully sell products in the clinical market  lengthy sales cycles in certain markets  the performance and market acceptance of our new products  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and introduce new products into the clinical market  our reliance on distributors to market  sell and support our products  the occurrence of unforeseen expenditures  acquisitions or other transactions  our success in increasing our direct sales  the impact of competitive products and pricing  our ability to manage geographically dispersed operations  underlying market conditions worldwide and the other risks those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we assume no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report or to conform these forward looking statements to actual results 
overview we develop  manufacture  and market fully integrated systems that perform genetic analysis  including dna or rna analysis  for the clinical genetic assessment  life sciences and biothreat markets 
our systems enable rapid  sophisticated genetic testing of organisms and genetic based diseases by automating otherwise complex manual laboratory procedures 
genetic testing involves a number of complicated steps  including sample preparation  amplification and detection 
based on state of the art microfluidic and microelectronic technologies  our easy to use systems integrate these steps and analyze complex biological samples in our proprietary test cartridges 
we are focusing our efforts on those applications where rapid genetic testing is particularly important  such as the infectious disease  cancer and biothreat testing markets 
in particular  we have designed our systems to be capable of use in clinical genetic assessment 
we have designed our systems to perform a broad range of genetic tests that are used to identify infectious organisms  enhance cancer management and care and identify organisms that could be used as bio terrorism agents 
our two principal product platforms are our smartcycler and genexpert systems 
our initial product platform  the smartcycler  integrates dna amplification and detection to allow rapid genetic analysis of a sample 
we commenced sales of the smartcycler in may and we have sold more than  units to date to a wide range of customers 
our second product platform  the genexpert  integrates automated sample preparation with our smartcycler amplification and detection technology 
we launched the genexpert system in the biothreat market in the third quarter of and anticipate its commercial launch in the clinical genetic assessment market in the first half of we sell our products through both direct sales and various distribution channels worldwide 
in addition to our own activities  we are collaborating with strategic partners to co develop assays 
a northrop grumman led consortium that includes cepheid and other subcontractors has developed the biohazard detection system bds for the united states postal service usps 
this consortium was awarded a production contract that included a million first phase  with the usps having an option for a second phase  which was exercised subsequent to the close of the quarter ended december  based on the orders received through the end of the first quarter of  we have received approximately to of the first phase amount 
we expect to begin shipping genexpert modules to be utilized with phase installations during the first quarter in december  we entered into an agreement for a strategic commercial relationship with biomerieux for biomerieux to develop dna testing products using their proprietary nucleic acid sequence based amplification nasba technology to be run on systems employing our genexpert platforms 
under the agreement  biomerieux has paid us a million license fee  and an additional million payment will become due when and if biomerieux commercializes its first product based on our technology 
we may also receive potential product purchases and royalty payments on end user genexpert test cartridge sales under the agreement if any such products are introduced 
the million license fee received from biomerieux was deferred and is being amortized over the period of approximately five years from the effective date  which represents the estimated period of our continuing involvement under the collaboration agreement 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a patent license agreement with applera corporation  through applied biosystems group abi and celera diagnostics  and  effective july   we entered into a patent license agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche  each of which provides for non exclusive worldwide licenses to make  use  and sell our products incorporating technologies covered by applera and roche s respective patents 
under the license agreements  we agreed to pay aggregate license fees of million  of which million had been paid as of december   million will be paid in  and million will be paid in we also agreed to pay applera and roche ongoing royalties on sales of products incorporating their licensed patents 
in connection with the license agreements  we recorded intangible assets of million  representing the present value of license fee obligations which is net of imputed interest of million 
the intangible assets related to the applera and roche licenses are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of approximately and years  respectively  with the amortization recorded as part of the cost of product sales 
sales channels we sell our products through both direct and other various distribution channels 
in the united states  we sell through our direct sales force in life sciences and clinical genetic assessment markets  as well as through a non exclusive distributor  fisher scientific company llc fisher  in the life sciences market 
in europe  we sell primarily through distributors 
in japan and other parts of the world  we sell solely through distributors 
through cepheid sa  our french subsidiary  we have established additional distributors in europe  the middle east  india and south africa  leading to increased product sales in those regions 
we expect to continue to expand sales into other territories throughout the world by adding new distributors 
for example  we added distributors in mexico  brazil and china in research and development since our inception  we have devoted significant resources to research and development  particularly in developing the technologies for our smartcycler and genexpert platforms and  more recently  developing assays and asrs for use on those platforms 
research and development expenses were approximately million in  million in  and million in we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in as we increase our assay development costs and incur clinical trial and regulatory costs related to the initiation of clinical trials for our gbs and enterovirus test for use on our genexpert system 
revenues during  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales of genexpert anthrax cartridges and modules to northrop grumman and smiths detection for use in the usps program  from sales of smartcyclers and associated disposables and reagents and  to a lesser extent  from contract revenue primarily derived from the amortization of the up front license payments in connection with our collaboration with biomerieux described above 
in  we expect sales of genexpert anthrax cartridges to contribute a substantial portion of our revenue as the usps bds program continues 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  impairment of intangible assets  inventory reserve  warranty accrual and stock based compensation to be critical accounting policies 
inherent in our determination of when to recognize revenue  and in our calculation of our asset impairment  inventory reserve and warranty accrual  are a number of significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments include deciding whether the elements required to recognize revenue from a particular arrangement are present and estimating the amount of inventory obsolescence and warranty costs associated with shipped products 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products and contract arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
determining whether the elements required for us to recognize revenue are present including  for example  determining whether there is sufficient evidence that an arrangement exists  the collectibility of billings and whether contractual performance obligations and milestones have been met requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect our operating results 
for example  our determination of the probability of collection is based upon assessment of the customer s financial condition through review of their current financial statements or publicly available credit reports 
for sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also considered in assessing probability of collection 
we are required to exercise significant judgment in deciding whether collectibility is reasonably assured  and such judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenues and our results of operations 
product sales 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped  there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
no right of return exists for our products except in the case of damaged goods 
we have not experienced any significant returns of our products 
contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of fees earned under technology license arrangements  fees for services rendered under research and development arrangements  for grants and government sponsored research agreements and for milestone payments and royalties received under license and collaboration agreements 
deferred revenue is recorded when funds are received in advance of technologies to be delivered or services to be performed 
license revenue is generally recognized only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
however  in multiple element revenue arrangements  if the delivered technology does not have stand alone value or if we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered products or services  the amount of revenue allocable to the delivered technology is deferred and amortized over the related involvement period in which the remaining products or services are provided to the customer 
research and development and government sponsored research contract revenues are recognized as the related services are performed based on the performance requirements of the relevant contract 
under the agreements  we are required to perform specific research and development activities and are compensated based on the costs  or costs plus a mark up  associated with each specific contract over the term of the agreement 
incentive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone  assuming there are no continuing performance obligations related to that milestone 
incentive milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of the arrangement and are normally triggered by events external to cepheid 
royalties are based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured  and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the customer 
impairment of intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of rights to certain patented technologies that we purchased in intangible assets are recorded at cost  less accumulated amortization 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years  on a straight line basis 
amortization of intangible assets is included in cost of product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we will review our intangible assets for impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we conduct the impairment review at least annually  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from an asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets  the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
there were no impairment charges taken in inventory reserve and warranty accrual we maintain reserves for inventory obsolescence and warranty costs that we believe are reasonable and that are based on our historical experience and current expectations for future performance 
the inventory reserve is established using management s estimate of the potential future obsolescence or excess of inventory 
as of december   reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million 
a substantial decrease in demand for our products or the introduction of new products could lead to excess inventories and could require us to increase our reserve for inventory obsolescence 
our current estimate or assumption is consistent with prior periods and  in the past  there have not been significant adjustments of the actual results to our estimates 
our warranty accrual is established using management s estimate for the future costs of any instrument failures during the to month warranty period and is based on the actual historical rates of instrument failure  adjusted for any known conditions that would impact future instrument failure 
as of december   warranty accrual was approximately million 
a significant change in failure rates of our smartcycler system could lead to increased warranty costs and could require us to increase our warranty reserve 
if such adverse conditions were to occur  we cannot readily predict what effect on our financial condition or results of operations would result  as any such effect would depend on both future results of operations and the magnitude and timing of the adverse conditions 
our current estimate or assumption is consistent with prior periods and  in the past there have not been significant adjustments of the actual results to our estimates 
stock based compensation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in fasb statement  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  we expect to adopt sfas r on july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirement using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  we currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the amounts related to the adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  and whether we will be in a taxable position 
there is no tax impact related to the prior periods since we are in a net loss position 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
sfas no clarifies treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage  specifying that such costs should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
the new statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  companies must apply the standard prospectively 
we believe the adoption of this statement will have no material effect on us 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues years ended december  change amounts in thousands revenues instrument sales   reagent and disposable sales   total product sales   contract revenues  grant and government sponsored research revenue  total revenues   total revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in total revenues in as compared to was primarily due to an overall increase in product sales which was driven in large part by sales related to the usps bds  and  to a lesser extent  by sales of our products in the life sciences and clinical genetic assessment markets 
product sales total product sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased sales volume of genexpert modules and cartridges to smiths detection and northrop grumman for deployment of bds units in selected usps mail sorting facilities throughout the united states 
in  product sales to northrop grumman and smiths detection represented and  respectively  of total product sales 
in  product sales to northrop grumman represented of total product sales 
in  there was no one direct customer that represented greater than of total product sales 
in and  product sales through distributors represented and  respectively  of our total product sales including instruments  reagents and disposables 
the following table provides a breakdown of our product sales by geographic regions years ended december  as of total product sales total product sales north america europe japan rest of world total product sales product sales through distributors in north america europe japan rest of world total product sales through distributors no single country outside of the united states represented more than of our total revenues in any period presented 
contract revenue contract revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the amortization of license fees in conjunction with our collaboration agreement with biomerieux  inc we do not expect contract revenue to be a significant component of revenue 
grant and government sponsored research revenue grant and government sponsored research revenue decreased to  in from million in the revenue was derived principally from our research and development contract with the usamriid 
the decline in grant and government sponsored research revenue in resulted from the expiration of the usamriid contract in november and our decision not to emphasize these sources of revenue 
years ended december  change amounts in thousands costs and operating expenses cost of product sales   collaboration profit sharing  research and development   selling  general and administrative   expense for patent related matter  n a total costs and operating expenses   cost of product sales cost of product sales consists of raw materials  direct labor  manufacturing overhead  facility costs and warranty costs 
cost of product sales also includes royalties on product sales and amortization of intangible assets related to technology licenses 
as a result of the increased product sales discussed above  cost of product sales increased to million in from million in our product gross margin percentage in was consistent at when compared to increased sales of higher gross margin products were offset by an increase in royalty and license costs resulting from our new license agreements with applera and roche  as well as manufacturing inefficiencies related to scale up on our anthrax cartridge production 
we expect our gross margin in to improve marginally as we improve our economies of scale 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of salaries and personnel related expenses  research and development materials  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in as compared to was comprised of a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses  a million increase in facilities allocation and a million increase in travel expenses 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in outside engineering and consulting costs and a million decrease in research supplies 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in as we increase our assay development costs and incur clinical trial and regulatory costs related to the initiation of clinical trials for our gbs and enterovirus test for use on our genexpert system 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  facility  legal  accounting and other professional fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase included a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses resulting from increases in sales and marketing and executive headcount  a million increase in consulting  legal and accounting expenses related to compliance with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  licensing and other strategic activities  a million increase in advertising  a million increase in travel expenses due to the increased sales activities and a million increase in insurance expenses 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in as we make additions to our clinical genetic assessment sales force 
expense for patent related matter in march  before we reached a final and definitive license agreement with applera  we recorded a charge and accrued a corresponding liability in the amount of million related to estimated royalties on past product sales based on agreed upon royalty rates 
the amount was fully paid in the second quarter of upon execution of the license agreement in that quarter 
collaboration profit sharing collaboration profit sharing represents the amount that we pay to abi under our collaboration agreement to develop reagents for use in the bds developed for the usps 
under the agreement  computed gross margin on anthrax cartridge sales are shared equally between the two parties 
the collaboration profit sharing was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in collaboration profit sharing was the result of increased anthrax cartridge sales under the usps bds program 
other income  net years ended december  change amounts in thousands other income expenses  net interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss total other income expenses  net other income  net consists of interest income  interest expense and foreign exchange gain or loss 
interest income increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our higher average cash and cash equivalents balance in due to our follow on offering in february interest expense increased to million in from 
million in the increase was due to a million amortization of imputed interest related to the license fee payments in income taxes we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december  and  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards  research credit carryforwards and capitalized research and development costs 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million 
our federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in total revenues in as compared to was primarily due to an overall increase in product sales 
total product sales increased to million in from million in out of the increase in  came from increased sales volume of our existing products and the remainder came primarily from the sales of our new products such as smartcycler ii and gbs 
the growth in product sales in as compared to resulted from the growth of sales volume of our smartcycler system  particularly in europe as well as increasing sales volume of genexpert anthrax cartridges and modules to northrop grumman and smiths detection under the usps program 
the increase in product sales in europe was due primarily to the establishment of several new distributors in this region through our wholly owned french subsidiary  cepheid sa 
in and  product sales through distributors represented and  respectively  of our total product sales including instruments  reagents and disposables 
we had one direct customer that represented of product sales for the year ended december  and had no direct customers that represented more than of product sales for the year ended december  the following table provides a breakdown of our product sales by geographic regions year ended december  as of total product sales total product sales north america europe rest of world product sales through distributors north america europe rest of world no single country outside of the united states represented more than of our total revenues in any period presented 
contract revenue contract revenues increased to  in from  in this increase resulted from work performed in conjunction with our participation in the pilot program to develop the bds for the usps 
grant and government sponsored research revenue increased to million in from million in the revenue was derived principally from our research and development contract with the usamriid 
cost of product sales cost of product sales decreased to million in from million in our product gross margin percentage in was as compared to in the increase of in product gross margin in as compared to was due primarily to a change in product mix to higher gross margin products and overall higher sales volume leading to increased manufacturing economies of scale 
out of the increase in  a shift in our product mix to higher gross margin products accounted for and increased manufacturing economies of scale due to increased volumes of our existing products along with new product introductions accounted for most of the remainder of the increase as compared to research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the primary reason for the decrease in as compared to was a reduction in work force that we completed in september specifically  the decrease in as compared to was comprised primarily of a million decrease in salaries and personnel related expenses  a million decrease in outside engineering and consulting costs  a million decrease in facilities allocation and a million decrease in amortization of deferred stock compensation  partially offset by a million increase in research and development materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the organization and establishment of our wholly owned french subsidiary in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  and increases in sales and marketing and executive headcount 
specifically  the increase in as compared to was comprised primarily of a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses  a million increase in travel expenses due to the increased sales activities  a million increase in consulting costs and a million increase in insurance costs  partially offset by a million decrease in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
collaboration profit sharing the  in collaboration profit sharing in was related to the profit sharing provision under our collaboration agreement with applied biosystems to develop reagents for use in the bds developed for the usps 
under the agreement  computed gross margin on anthrax cartridge sales is shared equally between the two parties 
other income  net other income  net decreased to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from our lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as well as lower interest rates  partially offset by foreign exchange gain in income taxes we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december  and  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards  research credit carryforwards and capitalized research and development costs 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million 
our federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities including million in restricted cash 
in  we received a total of million in cash proceeds  net of issuance costs  from sales of our common stock 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in short term commercial paper  auction rate securities and money market funds in order to minimize market risk and preserve principal 
through december   we had raised approximately million in aggregate net proceeds from sales of our equity securities 
net cash used for operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  net cash used for operating activities primarily consisted of million in cost of sales  million in research and development costs  million in selling  general and administration expenses  million in collaboration expenses and a million increase in inventory  largely offset by million in cash received from customers  million in accounts payable increases and million in other miscellaneous changes 
in  net cash used for operating activities primarily consisted of million in cost of sales  million in research and development costs  million in selling  general and administration expenses and a million increase in inventory  largely offset by million in cash received from customers  which included million in payments from biomerieux 
in  net cash used for operating activities consisted of million in cost of product sales  million in research and development costs and million in selling  general and administration expenses  partially offset by million in cash received from customers and a million decease in payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the above amounts for cost of sales  research and development costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are net of stock based compensation expenses and depreciation and amortization on property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
in  net cash used in investing activities consisted of million in capital expenditures  million in purchases of marketable securities and million for technology license payments 
net cash used in investing activities in consisted of million in capital expenditures partially offset by a million decrease in restricted cash due to the termination of two standby letters of credit resulting in the return of corresponding collateral 
net cash provided by investing activities in consisted of million from the maturity of marketable securities  partially offset by million in capital expenditures and million in restricted cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively

the million in consisted of proceeds of million from sales of common stock  including net proceeds of million from our august common stock offering  and million in proceeds from equipment and mortgage loans  partially offset by repayments of million on our equipment and mortgage loans 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years equipment loans    operating leases      purchase obligations   line of credit   license fee    minimum royalties    total      through december   we had financed a total of approximately million in equipment purchases under an equipment financing agreement 
our total obligation under this agreement was approximately million at december  the equipment loans are secured by the financed equipment  bear interest at a weighted average interest rate of and are due in monthly installments 
under the equipment financing agreement  a balloon payment is due at the end of each individual lease term of the underlying equipment 
as of december   there was no remaining credit available under this agreement 
purchase obligations include purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for six months 
minimum royalty payments represent technology license fees we are obligated to pay under our license agreements 
total obligation amount presented in the table does not include contractual obligations recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet as of december  in november  the company entered into an agreement with a financial lending institution for a revolving line of credit totaling million of which up to million may be used for letters of credit  which is collateralized by the company s accounts receivables and bears an annual interest rate equal to the lender s prime rate 
the line of credit contains a financial covenant that requires the company to maintain at least a million balance in investments with the lender and a minimum of million in unrestricted cash in total 
the line of credit expires in november   at which time any outstanding balance on the line of credit will be due 
as of december   we borrowed million under this line 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid could vary in some circumstances depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec and in fr financial condition outlook we plan to continue to make expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity  to support our activities in sales and marketing and research and development  to support our working capital needs  and to obtain technology licenses 
in  we expect to spend approximately million for capital equipment 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations through at least the end of we used million in cash excluding the purchases of million in marketable securities in our operations and investing activities during we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for the next several years 
this expectation is based on our current and long term operating plan and may change as a result of many factors  including our future capital requirements and our ability to increase revenues and reduce expenses  which  in many instances  depend on a number of factors outside our control 
for example  our future cash use will depend on  among other things  market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology or to use our technology in new markets  and the availability of other financing 
in the future  we may seek additional funds to support our strategic business needs and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements  or other available means 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or equity related securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms to meet our business needs  our business may be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our investments in interest bearing assets are subject to interest rate risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our interest bearing portfolio  which consists of cash and cash equivalents  in short term commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the short term nature of the investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore we have not included quantitative tabular disclosure in this form k 
we do not enter into financial investments for speculation or trading purposes and are not a party to financial or commodity derivatives 
we have operated primarily in the united states and a majority of our revenue  cost  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars for accordingly  we do not have material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
