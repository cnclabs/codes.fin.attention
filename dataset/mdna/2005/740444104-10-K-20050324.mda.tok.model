item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market overview in utility customers within our domestic energy market continued to make moderate increases in expenditures for maintenance of existing lines and for new construction projects previously deferred 
we believe the improving general economy will enable the utility customers in the energy market to continue moderate increased spending in however  any additional significant increases in investment by the utility customers in the energy market to rebuild the nation s transmission system are uncertain until pending regulatory issues are resolved 
the energy bill remains stalled in congress  and the federal energy regulatory commission continues discussion on the development of a deregulated market model acceptable to all affected parties 
we believe domestic communication companies are still cautiously managing their construction projects for digital subscriber loops dsl and doing minimal maintenance to their copper wire networks 
however  we believe these companies are recognizing the need to increase their network capabilities in order to be competitive with the cable television catv operators  competitive local exchange carriers  and broadband over power companies 
companies in the communication market continue their commitment to bring fiber to the premise fttp 
verizon recently stated its target for is to pass two million homes and businesses with fiber

we have commitments under operating leases primarily for office and manufacturing space  transportation equipment and computer equipment and capital leases primarily for equipment 
see note e in the notes to 
table of contents consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the future minimal rental commitments under these leasing arrangements 
one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk for the residual value in excess of the market value of the aircraft 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be immaterial because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value 
our financial position remains strong and our current ratio at december  was compared to at december  working capital of million has increased from the december  amount of million primarily due to greater receivables and inventory due to higher sales levels 
at december   our unused balance under our main credit facility was million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 
the revolving credit agreement contains  among other provisions  requirements for maintaining levels of working capital  net worth  and profitability 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our existing cash position  together with our untapped borrowing capacity  provides substantial financial resources 
if we were to incur significant additional indebtedness  we expect to be able to meet liquidity needs under the credit facilities but at an increased cost for interest and commitment fees 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are summarized in the following tables payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years thousands of dollars long term debt a leases purchase commitments pension contribution b amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial less than after commitments total year years years years thousands of dollars letter of credit guarantees a interest is not included in the table  as all amounts are variable 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements b amount represents expected contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plan for the year ending december  future expected amounts have not been disclosed as such amounts are subject to change based on performance of the assets in the plan as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation 
see note c in the notes to consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million and at december  the allowance represented of our trade receivables  compared to at december  excess and obsolescence reserves we have provided an allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence based on estimates of future demand  which is subject to change 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be utilized 
at december   the allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence was of gross inventories  compared to at december  if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or reversals of existing reserves may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
our measurement date for our annual impairment test is january of each year 
we perform interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
there were no trigger events during or and as such only an annual impairment test was performed 
during the fourth quarter of  the market valuation of one domestic reporting unit had decreased  such that it was highly probable that the related goodwill would not be recoverable 
therefore  at december   we had recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the 
table of contents company established a valuation allowance to record its deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made

as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
