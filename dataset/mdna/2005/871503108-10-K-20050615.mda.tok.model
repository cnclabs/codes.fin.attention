critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in symantec s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on symantec s consolidated statement of income  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and symantec s financial condition 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we also refer you to our summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page in this annual report on form k 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of symantec s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and they require us to make many estimates 
we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory to meet future customer demand  which is generally to weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends 
we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on their valid purchase orders 
our distributors and resellers base the quantity of their orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand  which may exceed our expected level of a to week supply 
we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a to week supply 
we estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level 
because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned  we do not recognize revenue or record accounts receivable for the amount in excess of the expected inventory levels 
on the same basis  we reduce the associated cost of revenues  which is primarily related to materials  and include this amount in inventory 
we recognize these revenues and the associated cost of revenues when the liberal rights of return expire  which is when the inventory levels no longer exceed the expected level of a to week supply 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented 
as of each of the fiscal years ended march    and  the amount of net revenues not recognized related to excess inventory represented no more than of total net revenues recognized during each of the years then ended 
associated costs that were included in inventory as of each of the fiscal years ended march    and represented no more than of the total cost of revenues recorded during each of the years then ended 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and consumer product content updates and totaled billion as of march   of which million was represented as long term deferred revenue  on the consolidated balance sheet 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the 
table of contents respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
reserves for product returns end users may return our products  primarily within our consumer products and enterprise administration segments  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
our estimated reserves for such end user product returns  which are recorded as an offset to revenue  are based primarily on historical trends 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to revenue 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
more or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual results 
for additional information see schedule ii on page reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves as an offset to revenue for channel and end user rebates  related primarily to products within our consumer products  enterprise security  and enterprise administration segments 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program  and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
for additional information see schedule ii on page business combinations when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities acquired and identifiable intangible assets 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
at march   goodwill was billion  acquired product rights were million  and other identifiable intangible assets were million 
we assess the impairment of goodwill within our reporting units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model  or changes in operating performance 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in write downs of net long lived and intangible assets  which would be reflected by charges to our operating results for any period presented 

table of contents accounting for excess facilities we have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating  moving  and relocating various groups or sites as a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions 
in determining our estimates  we obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub lessee 
market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates 
our ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual for site closures 
differences between estimates of related broker commissions  tenant improvements  and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation 
if we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess facilities costs  the amount recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded 
income taxes we make significant estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income taxes payable 
our estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon future united states taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
our estimates regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in united states or international tax laws  and other factors 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 
legal contingencies from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in legal proceedings as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
when the likelihood of the incurrence of costs related to our legal proceedings is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs  we provide for estimates of external legal fees and any probable losses through charges to our consolidated statements of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and intervening events 
our accrual for legal contingencies as of march  represented insignificant amounts related to external legal fees and no amounts were accrued for probable losses as we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if we are successful  estimated costs for external legal fees could be more than anticipated 
if we are unsuccessful  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees for which we have not accrued any amounts for loss contingencies  or to modify our business practices 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
results of operations overview in fiscal  we continued to pursue our goal of serving customer needs while reshaping the competitive landscape by offering new versions of integrated solutions 
we believe that we continued to make progress 
table of contents toward this goal as we introduced several new product offerings while posting substantial growth in revenue and earnings 
we operate our business within five operating segments consumer products  enterprise security  enterprise administration  services  and other 
within the consumer products segment  we continued to grow our base of individual users and accelerated our expansion into the small business market 
our norton brand of consumer security products continued as a market leader in desktop protection 
in addition  we released new versions of our award winning consumer products  including norton tm internet security  norton antivirus  norton personal firewall  norton antispam tm  and norton systemworks 
these new products provide protection from viruses  intrusion attempts  and piracy threats  and offer expanded protection from emerging threats 
within the enterprise security segment  we continued to enhance and expand our product portfolio in order to address the evolving threat environment with the release of new versions of our integrated solutions symantec gateway security  symantec enterprise security manager  and symantec incident manager 
in addition  we maintained our focus on enhanced manageability and more comprehensive intrusion protection 
the enterprise administration segment continued to benefit from our new product introductions  including the on icommand tm product family related to our business acquisition of on technology  and symantec client migration and the livestate tm recovery product family related to our business acquisition of powerquest  both of which were acquired in the second half of fiscal sales of our pcanywhere product continued to decline and we expect this trend to continue due to the extended functionality of microsoft operating system products 
on a worldwide basis  we closed bigger deals driven by the depth and breadth of our product and service offerings 
specifically  we generated  enterprise deals greater than  each  including deals greater than  each  and deals greater than million each 
deals greater than million increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  of the deals greater than  involved multiple symantec enterprise products and services 
cashflows were strong in fiscal as we delivered over billion in operating cash flow 
we no longer carry any debt due to the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes during fiscal and we ended fiscal with billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
net revenues during fiscal increased as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased sales of our consumer and enterprise security products 
we believe that a significant portion of the growth in demand was attributable to the continued increase in vulnerabilities  internet attacks  and malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of awareness of these threats around the world 
this growth in demand may not continue and  if it does not  our revenue growth rate may not be sustainable 
net revenues during fiscal increased as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased sales of our consumer and enterprise security products  which can be attributed to the numerous security threat outbreaks that occurred during fiscal  including the beagle  welchia  blaster  sobig  mydoom  and netsky viruses 
increased demand for our security protection solutions from large organizations as well as from small businesses and consumers also contributed to the growth 
from a regional standpoint  sales outside of the united states contributed strongly to revenue growth while sales in the united states also grew during these periods 
strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal and fiscal also positively impacted our international revenue growth 
a significant portion of our deferred revenue balance of million as of march  contributed to our total net revenues during fiscal deferred revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased maintenance obligations 
our net income was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and net income per diluted share  respectively 
our increased profitability is primarily the result of revenue growth offset in part by an increase in operating expenses largely 
table of contents attributable to an increase in employee headcount and related compensation 
approximately of our headcount increase was due to the growth of the company and approximately was due to business acquisitions 
during fiscal  we acquired the following businesses on june   we acquired brightmail  a developer of email services and software for application service providers  internet service providers  or isps  portals  and enterprises  for million in cash and assumed stock options 
on july   we acquired turntide  a developer of antispam routers  for million in cash 
on october   we acquired stake  a digital security company that helps corporations secure their critical infrastructure and applications  for million in cash 
on october   we acquired liric associates  a uk based consultancy firm that offers expertise in assessing the security needs of highly complex global networks and designing the architecture and policies to secure these networks  for million in cash 
on december   we acquired platform logic  a technology company that had developed a single host intrusion prevention product  for million in cash 
on january   we purchased technology patents from reefedge  inc for  in cash  which we recorded as acquired product rights 
on december   we announced a definitive agreement with veritas software corporation  or veritas  a leading independent supplier of storage and infrastructure software products and services 
under this agreement  we would acquire all of the outstanding stock of veritas in exchange for shares of symantec common stock for each outstanding share of veritas common stock 
in addition  we would assume all outstanding veritas stock options with an exercise price less than or equal to per share  as well as each outstanding option that was granted under certain specified veritas option plans  as adjusted in accordance with the exchange ratio 
all other outstanding veritas stock options would be cancelled 
the estimated purchase price is billion  which includes the estimated fair value of symantec common stock to be issued and veritas options to be assumed  as well as estimated direct transaction costs 
we derived this estimate using an average market price per share of symantec common stock of  which was based on an average of the closing prices for a range of trading days december  through december   inclusive around the announcement date december  of the proposed transaction 
the final purchase price would be determined based upon the number of veritas shares and options outstanding at the closing date 
completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions that include  among others  receipt of required approvals from symantec and veritas stockholders 
under terms specified in the merger agreement  symantec or veritas may terminate the agreement and as a result either symantec or veritas may be required to pay a million termination fee to the other party in certain circumstances 
while we currently anticipate that we will be in a position to complete the merger on or prior to june   we believe that there may be administrative benefits to completing the merger at the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal symantec and veritas have therefore discussed the possibility of closing the merger during the first week of that fiscal quarter 
unless otherwise indicated  the discussions in this document relate to symantec as a stand alone entity and do not reflect the impact of the pending business combination transaction with veritas 
information about the various factors that management deems important in contributing to our operating results for fiscal year   and is provided in the discussion below 

table of contents total net revenues year ended march  in thousands net revenues period over period increase net revenues increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to increases of million and million in sales of our consumer and enterprise security products  respectively 
the increased sales of these products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for our consumer security protection products and our enterprise virus protection solutions 
we believe that a significant portion of the growth in demand was attributable to the continued increase in vulnerabilities  internet attacks  and malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of awareness of these threats around the world

specifically  the increase in our consumer products revenue during fiscal was due primarily to an increase of million in sales of our norton internet security products  a comprehensive security solution  and an increase of million in sales of our norton antivirus products 
sales through our electronic distribution channel which includes sales of our norton internet security products and our norton antivirus products  including original equipment manufacturer  or oem  subscription renewals  grew by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe that a significant portion of the increase in revenues from our consumer products segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that occurred in august and february specifically  the increase in revenue from our consumer products segment during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to increases of million and million in sales of our norton antivirus and norton internet security products  respectively 
we experienced growth in our electronic distribution channel  including oem subscription renewals  where sales grew by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were offset slightly by a decrease in sales of our other consumer products

revenue from our enterprise security segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to an increase of million in sales of our antivirus products 
in addition  revenue increased due to sales of antispam products formerly associated with brightmail  which we acquired in june similarly  revenue from our enterprise security segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to a million increase in sales of our antivirus products 
this increase was attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that occurred in august and february net revenues from our enterprise administration segment year ended march  in thousands enterprise administration revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase our enterprise administration segment offers open and modular products and services that enable companies to effectively and efficiently manage their it infrastructures 
revenue from our enterprise administration segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to sales of products formerly associated with powerquest of million and on technology of million  which were acquired in the second half of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a continued decline in sales of our pcanywhere product 
we expect sales of our pcanywhere product to continue to decline in the future 
revenue from our enterprise administration segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to sales of powerquest products of million and sales of on technology products of million  after the respective dates of acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our pcanywhere product of million

we believe this increase in sales is attributable to increased customer awareness related to security threats 
in addition  strength in major foreign currencies positively impacted our international revenue growth during fiscal by million  as compared to fiscal the strength in foreign currencies is due primarily to the strength of the euro 
we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates 
if international sales become a greater proportion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
the increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal was due primarily to increased sales of our norton internet security and norton antivirus products in our consumer products segment and our

cost of revenues consists primarily of payments to oems under revenue sharing arrangements  costs for producing manuals and cds  fee based technical support costs  costs of services  royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements  packaging costs  manufacturing expenses  and amortization of acquired product rights 
gross margin remained flat at approximately during fiscal years   and we anticipate that our net revenues from our services segment may grow and comprise a higher percentage of our total net revenues  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin  as our services typically have higher cost of revenues than our software products 
acquired product rights acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies  patents  and revenue related order backlog and contracts from acquired companies

provision for income taxes year ended march  in thousands tax provision on earnings effective tax rate on earnings tax provision on repatriation total tax provision total effective tax rate 
table of contents our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately   and during fiscal   and respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under the american jobs creation act 
american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings on october   the american jobs creation act of  or the jobs act  was signed into law 
under the jobs act  we may elect an dividends received deduction for repatriating eligible dividends from our foreign subsidiaries in either the year ended march  or certain criteria must be met to qualify for the deduction  including the establishment of a domestic reinvestment plan by our chief executive officer  and the approval of the plan by our board of directors  whereby the repatriated earnings must be reinvested in the united states 
the maximum amount of our foreign earnings that qualify for the deduction is million 
during the march quarter  we repatriated million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries under the jobs act provisions 
we recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of approximately million in accordance with tax laws existing at the time 
the million repatriation under the jobs act was deemed to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had been previously treated as indefinitely reinvested 
however  this distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position going forward that future earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested 
in may  clarifying language was issued by the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated under the jobs act 
as a result of this clarifying language  we will reduce the million tax expense attributable to the million repatriation by approximately million  to million 
this reduction in tax expense will be recorded in our first quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents our principal source of liquidity as of march  is our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of billion  as well as cash that we generate over time from our operations

table of contents contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of march  payments due in total payments fiscal fiscal fiscal due fiscal and and and thereafter in thousands purchase obligations operating leases total contractual obligations pending merger on december   we announced a definitive agreement with veritas under which we would acquire all of the outstanding stock of veritas in exchange for shares of symantec common stock for each outstanding share of veritas common stock

development agreement during the march quarter  we entered into a development agreement in the amount of million in connection with the refurbishment of a building in dublin  ireland 
payment of this amount is contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones 
as none of these milestones have been reached as of march   there is no accrual relative to the million commitment included in our liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of underlying revenue and has not been included in the table above 
certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations  however  as of march  all such obligations are immaterial 
indemnification as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion or all of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal

business risk factors the following risk factors present certain risks relative to symantec without giving effect to the proposed merger with veritas 
we have provided in the joint proxy statement prospectus that was first mailed to our stockholders on may   under the caption risk factors risks related to symantec after the merger  risks that we believe may apply to symantec and veritas operating as a combined company if the merger is completed 
the joint proxy statement prospectus is included in our registration statement on form s which is on file with the securities and exchange commission 

table of contents there are numerous risks associated with our recent entry into an agreement to merge with veritas 
on december  we announced that we had entered into an agreement to merge with veritas in a transaction where veritas would become our wholly owned subsidiary and the outstanding shares of veritas common stock would convert into the right to receive shares of our common stock representing approximately of our outstanding shares following the merger 
there are numerous risks associated with our having entered into this agreement  including the following we cannot assure you that all conditions to the merger will be completed and the merger consummated 
the merger is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions  including the approval of our and veritas stockholders  and we cannot assure you that the merger will be completed 
in the event the merger is not completed  we may be subject to many risks  including the costs related to the proposed merger  such as legal  accounting  and advisory fees  which must be paid even if the merger is not completed  or the payment of a large termination fee to veritas under specified circumstances 
if the merger is not completed  the market price of our common stock could decline 
completion of the merger may result in dilution of net income per share 
the completion of the merger may not result in improved net income per share of symantec or in a financial condition superior to that which we would have achieved on a stand alone basis 
the merger could fail to produce the benefits that we anticipate  or could have other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
in addition  some of the assumptions that we have relied upon  such as the achievement of operating synergies  may not be realized 
in this event  the merger could result in a reduction of our net income per share as compared to the net income per share that we would have achieved if the merger had not occurred 
if we and veritas fail to successfully integrate our operations  the combined company may not realize the potential benefits of the merger 
if the merger is completed  the integration of symantec and veritas will be a time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our operations if it is not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
if this integration effort is not successful  our results of operations could be harmed  employee morale could decline  key employees could leave  and customers could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones 
in addition  we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger 
following the merger  symantec and veritas must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls  and human resources practices 
we may encounter the following difficulties  costs  and delays involved in integrating these operations failure to successfully manage relationships with customers and other important relationships failure of customers to accept new services or to continue using the products and services of the combined company difficulties in successfully integrating the management teams and employees of symantec and veritas challenges encountered in managing larger  more geographically dispersed operations loss of key employees diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns potential incompatibility of technologies and systems potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of the merger potential incompatibility of business cultures if the combined company s operations after the merger do not meet the expectations of existing customers of symantec or veritas  then these customers may cease doing business with the combined company altogether  which would harm our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents costs associated with the merger are difficult to estimate  may be higher than expected  and may harm the financial results of the combined company 
we have incurred substantial direct transaction costs associated with the merger and additional costs associated with consolidation and integration of operations and we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for these purposes 
if the total costs of the merger exceed estimates or the benefits of the merger do not exceed the total costs of the merger  our financial results could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock or securities convertible into  or exercisable for  our stock 
you should not rely on the results of prior periods as predictors of our future performance 
factors associated with the conduct of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
a number of factors associated with the operation of our business may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate  including our ability to effectively align sales resources to meet customer needs and address market opportunities timely release of new or enhanced versions of our products effectively manage the integration of recent acquisitions  including our proposed merger with veritas effectively respond to competitive pressures effectively manage our operating expense levels quarterly changes in our financial results could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
factors associated with our industry and the markets for our products may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
a number of factors associated with our industry and the markets for our products  many of which are outside our control  may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate  including reduced demand for any of our products entry of new competition into our markets timing and impact of threat outbreaks eg worms and viruses cancellation  deferral  or limitation of orders by customers fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the rate of adoption of new product technologies and new releases of operating systems weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the timing of orders by customers and channel partners may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
the timing and amount of orders by customers and channel partners and seasonality in the buying patterns of customers may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate 
the risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our quarterly net revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter 
most resellers have tended to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter 
in addition  many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter 
due to the unpredictability of these end of period buying patterns  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are 
table of contents less favorable to us 
if we do not achieve our forecasted results for a particular quarterly period  our stock price could decline significantly 
accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
our financial results have been in the past  and may continue to be in the future  materially affected by non cash and other accounting charges  including amortization of intangible assets  including acquired product rights stock based compensation expense restructuring charges and reversals of those charges our proposed merger with veritas would result in increases in the foregoing types of charges 
in particular  we expect to record approximately billion of intangible assets  including acquired product rights  in connection with the merger on which we will be required to record future amortization charges 
we also expect to record stock compensation expense related to the stock options to purchase veritas common stock assumed by us 
the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with other business acquisitions 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 
our markets are competitive and our financial results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition 
our markets are competitive 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to competition or if existing or new competitors gain market share  our sales may decline or be impaired and we may experience a decline in the prices we can charge for our products  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our competitive position depends on several factors  including our ability to respond to product price decreases implemented by our competitors our ability to adapt effectively to the continued development  acquisition  or licensing of technology or product rights by our competitors our ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and operating systems our ability to adapt to changing technological demands our strategic decisions regarding the best allocation of our limited resources our competitors include or may include the following independent software vendors who may offer products that directly compete with our products or bundle their software products with software offered by another vendor either directly or as part of a hardware appliance large operating system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers who may include security  remote access  or virus protection tools in their product offerings isps that provide security functionality to their subscribers at no additional fee microsoft has added security and remote access features to new versions of its operating system products 
in addition  microsoft has recently announced the acquisition of companies that offer security products that compete more directly with our security products 
microsoft s recent acquisitions include a provider of server based antivirus  antispam  and content filtering products  and a provider of antispyware and other internet security products 
in addition  microsoft has recently announced and has launched the internal testing of an online suite that includes automated protection  maintenance  and performance tuning 
this consumer subscription service  windows onecare  is expected to be a fee based service available to the general public by the end of calendar microsoft has also recently introduced a free antispyware product for the consumer market 
in the future  microsoft may offer additional security features or products that compete with our security products 

table of contents many of our strategic partners offer software products  and customers may prefer to purchase software and hardware that is produced by the same vendor 
in addition  these vendors may choose not to offer our products to their customers or to limit our access to their hardware platforms 
similarly  some software vendors may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform 
several of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  and other resources than we do and consequently may have an ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours 
our future and existing competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability  and functionality at lower prices than our products  and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products in order to compete with us 
our competitors could also gain market share by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our other competitors and isps such as aol and comcast 
in addition  because new distribution methods offered by the internet and electronic commerce have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by start up companies in the software industry  we may face additional sources of competition in the future 
if we do not adapt our business in the face of this competition  our business and operating results may be harmed 
because we derive a majority of our license revenues from sales of a few product lines  any decline in demand for these products could severely harm our ability to generate revenues 
we derive a majority of our revenues from a limited number of software products  including our antivirus and internet security products 
in addition  our software products are concentrated within the markets for data security 
net revenues from sale of our antivirus products within our consumer products and enterprise security segments represented   and of our total net revenues for fiscal   and  respectively 
net revenues from sales of our norton internet security product within our consumer products segment represented   and of our total net revenues during fiscal   and  respectively 
as a result  we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for these products  whether as a result of competition  product obsolescence  technological change  budget constraints of our potential customers  or other factors 
if our revenues derived from these software products were to decline significantly  our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
there is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth rates in sales of our products  particularly our consumer security products 
over the last several quarters  we have experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer security protection products  and we expect that we will not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a consistent basis 
we believe that consumer security protection sales have been spurred by a number of factors  including increased broadband usage and increased awareness of security threats to consumer systems  including several well publicized viruses 
the impact of these factors may diminish over time with greater market penetration  and it is possible that our growth rates in sales of consumer security protection products may decline 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance  we may be unable to recover product development costs  and our earnings and revenues may decline 
our future success depends on our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing new products  product upgrades  and services on a timely basis 
we have incurred  and we will need to continue to incur  significant research and development expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain competitive 
new product development and introduction involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges  including keeping pace with technological developments by competitors and customers extending the operation of our products to new platforms and operating systems entering into new and unproven markets with which we have limited experience managing new product and service strategies managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements  which has frequently been longer than we originally expected 
table of contents adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards incorporating acquired products and technologies developing new sales channels obtaining source code licenses from operating system owners on reasonable terms if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges  or if our new product introductions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance  we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenues in return  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 
we have in the past acquired  and we expect in the future to acquire  other businesses  business units  and technologies 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including complexity  time  and costs associated with integration of acquired business operations  employees  products  and technologies into our existing business  workforce  and product lines diversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities loss or termination of employees  including costs associated with the termination of those employees assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related to alleged liabilities of the acquired business the incurrence of additional acquisition related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders or earnings per share increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act substantial accounting charges for amortization of intangible assets  restructuring and related expenses  stock based compensation expense  write offs of in process research and development  and impairment of goodwill integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming  and expensive process 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
our success in completing the integration of acquired businesses may impact the market acceptance of such acquisitions  and our willingness to acquire additional businesses in the future 
other challenges of integration include our ability to incorporate acquired products and business technology into our existing product lines  including consolidating technology with duplicative functionality or designed on a different technological architecture  and our ability to sell the acquired products through our existing or acquired sales channels 
we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns common interests 
further  the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges  and increase our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
we may face difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 

table of contents we have authorized the use of a substantial amount of our cash for the repurchase of our shares  and this use of funds may limit our ability to complete other transactions or to pursue other business initiatives 
in march  our board of directors approved the expansion of our previously authorized share repurchase program by authorizing an additional billion of cash to be used for this purpose following completion of our merger with veritas 
with this increase  we have approximately billion of funding authorized for the repurchase of shares under this program 
we expect to repurchase shares for cash as business conditions warrant between the date of the completion of the merger and the end of our fiscal year  which ends on march  the full implementation of this repurchase program will use a significant portion of our cash reserves 
this use of cash could limit our future flexibility to complete acquisitions of businesses or technology or other transactions or make investments in research and development  new employee hiring  or other aspects of our operations that might be in our best interests  or could require that we borrow money or issue additional equity securities for such purposes 
any incurrence of debt may not be on terms favorable to us and could result in our being subject to covenants or other contractual restrictions that limit our ability to take advantage of other opportunities that may arise 
any such incurrence of debt would likely increase our interest expense  and any issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of existing stockholders 
we have in the past repurchased shares under our repurchase program at prices that are higher than the current trading prices of our common stock  and the prices at which we repurchase shares under the expanded repurchase program may exceed the prices at which our shares trade following such repurchases 
our international operations involve special risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results  and require increased time and attention of our management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us  including engineering  sales  customer support  and production operations 
we plan to expand our international operations  but such expansion is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities 
our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations  including potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation  or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations enactment of additional regulations or restrictions on the use  import  or export of encryption technologies  which could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation  which could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or which could make our products more expensive in those countries limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating our international operations  including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages 
table of contents political unrest  war  or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
although we hedge against our foreign currency exposure  hedging foreign currency transaction exposures is complex and subject to uncertainty 
we may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 
we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non us customers 
these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in both the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
if we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  our ability to manage our business could be impaired 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  and the results of our operations 
in addition  the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees and manage our employee base effectively  we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products  effectively manage or expand our business  or increase our revenues 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  sales  marketing  financial  and technical personnel 
however  competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant 
in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace  we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package  including cash and equity based compensation 
the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans and recent changes in accounting rules will require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity based compensation as compensation expense  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we may decide to issue fewer stock options and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  or conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
if we fail to manage our distribution channels effectively  or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we sell our consumer products to individuals and small offices home offices around the world through a multi tiered distribution network 
our products are available to customers through indirect channels that include distributors  retailers  direct marketers  internet based resellers  educational institutions  and isps  as well as through oems 
we separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to end users primarily via the internet 
we also sell some of our products and product upgrades through direct mail email and over the internet  in conjunction with channel partners 
indirect sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from sales through indirect channels  including distributors that sell our products to end users and other resellers 
this channel involves a number of special risks  including our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end users our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers 
table of contents our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our resellers and distributors may market and distribute competing products  in part due to pricing  terms  and promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict oem sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into  or bundle our products with  their products 
our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks  including our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems shipped our oem partners are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable in recognition of our increasingly competitive relationship with certain partners our oem arrangements subject us to factors affecting the products of our oem partners  which may result in changes in strategic direction  competitive risks  and other issues that could result in reduction of oem sales the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no associated revenues the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market our oem partners may develop  market  and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors  which could reduce our sales if we fail to manage our distribution channels successfully  our distribution channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate  which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses  as well as weaken our competitive position 
some distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past  and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future  we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense  which would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that cause unpredictability in demand 
this increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future  which could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
increased reliance on sales of enterprise licenses may result in greater fluctuations in  or otherwise adversely affect  our financial results 
sales of enterprise licenses through our enterprise security segment represent a major portion of our business 
enterprise licensing arrangements involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels  require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship  may involve greater pricing pressure  and sometimes result in lower operating margins 
the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their non renewal by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  longer license periods impede our ability to increase prices due to increased costs and may adversely impact our operating margins 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales by our direct sales force to enterprise customers 
there is a substantial amount of training required for sales representatives to become productive and that training must be updated to cover new and revised products 
if we are unable to maintain an adequate direct sales force  it could have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations 
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 
from time to time  we have received claims that we have 
table of contents infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims  including patent  copyright  and trademark infringement claims 
we have received several trademark claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future from third parties who may also be using our name or another name that may be similar to one of our trademarks or service marks 
we have also received patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties 
in addition  former employers of our former  current  or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling  to delay shipping  or to redesign our products require us to pay monetary amounts as damages  for royalty or licensing arrangements  or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
also  these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including patent and copyright infringement claims  which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software 
our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology  our financial results could be harmed 
our software and underlying technology are proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws 
however  all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by third parties 
third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization 
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently  including by designing around our patents 
our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products 
although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products  software piracy may depress our net revenues 
while this would adversely affect revenues domestically  lost revenues are believed to be even more significant outside of the united states  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected  and we cooperate with the business software alliance and the software information industry association in their efforts to combat piracy 
however  these efforts may not affect the piracy of our products 
our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures  or bugs may occur  especially when the products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software  and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in 
table of contents our products or may expose undetected errors  failures  or bugs in our products 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
in addition  despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures  or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures  and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
errors  failures  or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of competitive position  or claims by customers or others 
many of our end user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other less critical software products 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end user customer s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays  or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect our operating results 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that a court could rule that these provisions are unenforceable 
if a customer is successful in proving its damages and a court does not enforce our protective provisions  it could prove expensive and time consuming to defend against these claims  and we could be liable for the damages suffered by our customers and other related expenses  which could adversely affect our operating results 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions 
as such  we are highly dependent on the on going business success of the companies with whom we have contracted to provide these services 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
our inability to timely distribute our products and services over the internet  including security patches and content updates  could adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain and increase the speed with which we provide services to customers and to increase the scope of these services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the internet 
we are increasingly reliant on the internet as a means to distribute our security patches and content updates to our customers 
accordingly  if we  or our customers  are unable to utilize the internet due to a failure of technology or infrastructure  terrorist activity  or other reasons  our ability to provide services may suffer  which could lead to a decrease in revenues 
our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption  which could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be 
table of contents unable to anticipate these techniques 
our activities could be adversely affected  and our reputation and future sales harmed  if these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  and as a result you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and earnings forecasts by us  our competitors  or our customers failure to achieve financial forecasts  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us rumors  announcements  or press articles regarding changes in our management  organization  operations  or prior financial statements changes in revenue and earnings estimates by securities analysts announcements of planned acquisitions by us or by our competitors announcements of new or planned products by us  our competitors  or our customers gain or loss of a significant customer inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement  or other regulatory bodies acts of terrorism  the threat of war  and economic slowdowns in general the stock market in general  and the market prices of stocks of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price volatility  which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 
factors outside of our control may adversely affect our operations and operating results 
our operations and operating results may be adversely affected by many different factors which are outside of our control  including deterioration in economic conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate  which could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services political and military instability  which could slow spending within our target markets  delay sales cycles  and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively budgetary constraints of customers  which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives disruptions in our highly automated business operations caused by earthquakes  floods  or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley  california  an area known for seismic activity  or our other locations worldwide acts of war or terrorism malicious software programs  such as viruses and worms  or security breaches any of these factors could result in a loss of revenues and or higher expenses  which could adversely affect our financial results 
if the carrying value of our long lived assets is not recoverable  an impairment loss must be recognized which would adversely affect our financial results 
we will evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights  and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
for example  we estimate that we will record approximately billion of goodwill as a result of our merger with veritas and may record additional 
table of contents goodwill in connection with future acquisitions 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  regardless of events and circumstances 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  and we may incur substantial impairment charges  which could adversely affect our financial results 
our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate  which have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock based compensation the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and non recurring charges  which may cause fluctuations between reporting periods tax assessments against acquired entities with respect to tax periods prior to the acquisitions  which may significantly affect our effective tax rate for the period in which the settlements take place item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
all financial instruments used are in accordance with our global investment policy and global foreign exchange policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies 
these investments were recorded at cost  and are classified as other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are inherently risky and we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
as of march   these investments had an aggregate carrying value of million 
interest rate sensitivity we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale securities as of the balance sheet dates 
our available for sale securities are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a component in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of corporate securities  taxable auction rate securities  us government and government sponsored securities  and money market funds

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity we conduct business in international currencies through our worldwide operations 
we believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency cash  investments  receivables  and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange forward contracts as of march  were as follows in millions resulting increase decrease in fv of foreign forward exchange contracts given x appreciation devaluation of foreign currency notional foreign forward exchange contracts amount purchased sold we believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
all contracts have a maturity of no more than days 
gains and losses are accounted for as interest and other income  net each period 
we regularly review our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this review
