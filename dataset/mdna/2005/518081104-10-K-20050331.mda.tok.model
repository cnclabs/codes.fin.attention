item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our discussion and analysis of laserscope s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based upon laserscope s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our 
table of contents estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
overview laserscope is a leading provider of medical laser systems for surgical and aesthetic applications 
founded in  we are a pioneer developer of innovative technologies with over lasers installed worldwide in doctors offices  out patient surgical centers and hospitals 
our product portfolio consists of lasers and other light based systems and related energy delivery devices for medical applications including ktp  nd yag  and er yag 
laserscope primarily serves the needs of two medical specialties urology and aesthetic surgery 
our greenlight laser offers a breakthrough treatment for a urological disorder called benign prostatic hyperplasia bph  an enlargement of the prostate gland experienced by most men after the age of fifty 
for aesthetic applications  we offer a full line of products used to perform a wide variety of treatments including the removal of leg and facial veins  unwanted hair  pseudo folliculitis and wrinkles 
in the united states  we distribute our products to hospitals  outpatient surgical centers and physician offices through our own direct sales force and through the mckesson corporation medical group mckesson 
in december  we signed a distribution agreement that grants to mckesson the exclusive distribution rights for our core aesthetic laser products in the united states 
mckesson medical group s primary care division has a sales force of more than representatives throughout the united states who are supported by our own direct sales force 
in the united kingdom and france we distribute our products to hospitals  outpatient surgical centers and physician offices through our own direct sales force 
elsewhere  we sell our products through regional distributor networks throughout europe  the middle east  latin america  asia and the pacific rim 
laserscope is both iso and ce certified 
we have from time to time experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business 
during the months of july and august  certain of our international markets have exhibited slowdowns in the aesthetics business 
during  our revenues and net income grew substantially from the prior year as a result of continued growth in sales of our main urology products  the greenlight laser system and disposable fiber optic delivery devices  in addition to strong aesthetic sales 
our reported revenue for the year ended december  was million  a increase as compared to total revenues of million in  and net income in was million  or per diluted share  a increase when compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in an increase of in unit sales of disposable fibers over the prior year was a key factor in our financial success 
we expect revenues in our urological products  fueled by sales of the greenlight laser system and disposable fibers  to grow at a faster rate than our aesthetic products in the market for light based cosmetic treatment devices in which we sell our aesthetic products is characterized by low barriers to entry and marginal technological differentiation among product offerings 
we expect intense competition in the aesthetic market will continue to create price pressure on our aesthetic products 
as a result  we intend to address this challenge by focusing on the key features of  and the mix within  our product offerings affecting the value proposition to the customer  in particular the speed and comfort of light based aesthetic treatments 
there can be no assurance that our existing products and newly offered products will be competitive in an increasingly difficult market for light based cosmetic treatment devices 
adoption of the pvp procedure grew at a rapid rate in both domestically and internationally and we expect this trend to continue in our priority in the urology segment of our business is to establish the pvp procedure using the greenlight laser system as the worldwide standard for treating bph 
demonstrating and maintaining the clinical effectiveness and safety of the pvp procedure using our product is essential to 
table of contents achieving this goal 
demonstrating the cost effectiveness of our procedure as compared to other therapies will be important to penetrate the two tiered health care finance systems in the us and internationally 
with that in mind  we expect to make significant investments in sales  marketing and professional education and training in our efforts to increase adoption of pvp using our product in the united states  europe and the asia pacific region will be especially important to our continued success 
the international market for pvp  which we believe to be substantially greater than the us market offers great promise but also a greater variety challenges and uncertainties than our domestic efforts  which are discussed in greater detail in the risk factors section below 
we enjoyed a significant event in march  when the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced the assignment of the company s pvp procedure to the new technology ambulatory payment classification apc code 
the new classification provided for a payment rate of  for the pvp procedure performed in an outpatient hospital site of service  which was approximately twice that of the previous rate 
this reimbursement rate is effective until december  we believe that this development encouraged performance of the pvp procedure at those hospitals  where previously  due to economic considerations  it would not have been made available to patients 
as a result  pvp procedural volume and purchases of our greenlight laser system and disposable fibers increased 
obtaining satisfactory heath care reimbursement rates for the pvp procedure using the greenlight laser system from government and private insurers will continue to be a critical factor for our success in the domestic bph market 
obtaining government approvals of the pvp procedure as well as securing satisfactory reimbursement rates from public and private payers in the various foreign countries where we have introduced our greenlight product will be important for our future success in those markets 
our sensitivity to public and private payer reimbursement rates makes us subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  which are discussed in greater detail in the risk factors section below 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for laser returns  warranty obligation  excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  litigation costs  functional currency  and income tax revenue recognition we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue which includes lasers  instrumentation  and disposables and ii service revenue 
the company recognizes revenue on products and services when the persuasive evidence of an arrangement is in place  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  remaining obligations are insignificant  and title and risk of ownership has been transferred 
transfer of title and risk of ownership generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer or when the customer receives the product  depending on the nature of the arrangement 
service revenue is recognized as the services are provided and for service contracts on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers prior to making a sale in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  to account for the possibility that a customer may not pay us  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate losses based on the overall business climate  our accounts receivable aging profile  and an analysis of the circumstances associated with specific accounts which are past due 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of laserscope s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   and our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled approximately   and  respectively 
allowance for laser returns 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers prior to making a sale in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  to account for the possibility that a customer may not pay us and will instead return the laser system to us  we maintain an allowance for losses on laser returns 
we estimate losses based on a two year history of actual laser returns 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of laserscope s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we estimate losses based on a two year historical analysis of the margin impact of returns 
as of december   and our reserves for laser returns totaled approximately   and  respectively 
warranty obligation 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
in addition to these proactive measures  we also provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the cost of our warranty obligation based on product failure rates over the last twelve months and the actual material usage and service delivery costs experienced in correcting those failures 
however  should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
warranty reserves as of december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we maintain reserves for our estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
inventory reserves are recorded when conditions indicate that selling price may be less than cost due to factors such as estimates about future demand  reductions in selling prices  physical deterioration  usage and obsolescence 
the reserves are equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
as of december   and  our reserves were million  million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in july  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result do not amortize goodwill 
instead  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually  by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its book value 
a reporting unit is the lowest level of an entity that is a business and can be distinguished from other activities  operations  and assets of the entity 
if  during the annual impairment review  the book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
sfas no 
requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit  other than goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit  taken as a whole  and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  a decrease in the market value of an asset  the asset s inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  a decision to change the manner in which an asset is used  a physical change to the asset or a change in business climate 
we calculate estimated future undiscounted 
table of contents cash flows  before interest and taxes  of the related operation and compare it to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based upon a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a related reporting unit may require us to record an impairment charge in the future 
the effect of a change in the company s estimates and assumptions related to goodwill could be an impairment loss equal to as much as the total of goodwill we have reported  which is  litigation 
our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and related pronouncements 
also in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not record gain contingencies 
functional currency 
we have a foreign subsidiary in france which sells to customers in france  and we also have a subsidiary in the united kingdom which sells to customers in all of europe  except france  as well as customers in pacific rim countries 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records into united states dollars 
our two subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their functional currencies which are also their respective local currencies  the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billing  financing  payroll  and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
since our two subsidiaries functional currencies are deemed to be the local currencies  any gain or loss associated with the translation of those subsidiaries financial statements is included  as a component of shareholders equity  in cumulative translation adjustments 
if in the future we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary from its local currency to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
income tax 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management reviews its assumptions regarding the realization of deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
continued profitability and future changes in management s assumptions may result in a partial or full release of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
a release of the valuation allowance would have a favorable impact on the tax provision within the statement of operations 
for the year ended december  the company has decided to not reverse its deferred tax valuation allowance since the weight of evidence does not exceed the threshold of more likely than not as required by sfas no 
that the company would be able to realize its deferred tax asset

we also generate export sales through our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france and sell to independent distributors in the rest of the world 
we operate in a technologically advanced  dynamic and highly competitive environment 
our future operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
while we attempt to identify and respond to these conditions in a timely manner  these conditions represent significant risks to our performance 
international sales accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
we believe that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
a large portion of our international sales occur through our foreign subsidiaries and exports to foreign distributors 
our international sales and operations are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  particularly the financial impact of currency fluctuations  more limited intellectual property protections  greater difficultly in monitoring and ensuring positive clinical outcomes and regulation by foreign governmental entities among others described in the risk factors section below 
these risks could harm our financial condition  results of operations and future cash flows 
through december   sales outside of the united states have been denominated in the local currencies of the united kingdom and france and in united states dollars for the rest of the world 
during  and  fluctuations in foreign currencies did not materially affect the results of operations reported by laserscope 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency risk in a number of areas 
although our revenues denominated in united states dollars represented over of total revenues in  in and in  market risk exists in foreign countries where we sell in united states dollars  and a major strengthening of the united states dollar could have a material negative impact on our business

results compared to during  total revenues increased approximately million  or  from during  revenues from the sales of laser equipment and instrumentation increased to million  or of total net revenues  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in the increases in sales of these products is attributed to higher sales of greenlight laser systems for the treatment of bph as well as higher sales of lasers and instrumentation for aesthetic applications 
during the year ended december   we sold greenlight laser systems compared to in the corresponding period of this increase is attributed to higher demand for the product created by the growing popularity of the photo vaporization of the prostate pvp procedure that uses the greenlight laser system 
the increase in sales of lasers and instrumentation for aesthetic applications is attributed to continued demand for products used in these types of applications 
sales of these products increased during the year ended december  compared to the demand comes from growing numbers of doctors particularly family practice doctors and ob gyn doctors adding aesthetic procedures to their traditional practices as well as the continued strong demand from patients seeking these types of procedures 
we expect to see higher sales of greenlight laser systems and aesthetic laser systems and instrumentation during as we expect demand for the procedures which use these systems to continue to grow 
net revenues from shipments of disposable supplies were higher in than  and were approximately million  or  of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues in these higher revenues are principally due to increasing demand for the addstat disposable fiber optic devices which are used with the greenlight laser system in the pvp procedure 
since the introduction of the greenlight laser system and the pvp procedure  laserscope has sold over  addstat devices for use in the pvp procedure 
table of contents we believe that our future sales of disposable supplies depend on our ability to increase our installed base of systems and also to develop and promote surgical procedures that use these products including the pvp procedure and or other procedures that we may develop and commercialize 
service revenues were higher in than  and were approximately million  or of total revenues in  compared to million  or of revenue in service revenues increased in all geographic regions  but the growth rate was marginally higher at our foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that future revenues will depend on increases to the installed base of lasers as well as customers purchasing service contracts 
product gross margin as a percentage of net product revenues was in  an improvement of percentage points compared to results for in  gross margin increased due to a shift in the product mix towards higher margin disposable devices 
we expect that product gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues in  will be marginally higher than the level of however  we expect that these amounts may vary from quarter to quarter during and will depend on product demand and distribution mix 
gross margin from service activities as a percentage of net service revenues was in compared to in the decrease reflects an increase in material costs 
we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues from service activities in  will be similar to levels 
research and development expenses result from activities related to the development of new laser  instrumentation and disposable products  the enhancement of our existing products and the development of surgical applications for new and existing products 
in  amounts spent on research and development increased from amounts spent in we expect that amounts spent in research and development during will be higher in absolute terms than that spent in but lower as a percentage of net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to this was due in part to higher commissions paid commensurate with the increase in aesthetic and surgical revenues  higher marketing and education expenses related to expanding the presence of the company s products in both domestic and international markets  as well as increased costs related to compliance with the new requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute terms will be higher during than in but lower as a percentage of net revenues 
this will be the result of direct selling expense increases relating to higher revenues and continued investment in educational programs and marketing initiatives for our products 
in  we recorded an income tax provision of  while the united states operations reported a book income before tax  due to net operating loss carry forwards  the united states entity s tax liability was limited to the alternative minimum tax 
the united kingdom subsidiary incurred a charge of  for income taxes due to its profitability 
while the french subsidiary reported a net income in  no tax provision was required due to that entity s net operating loss carry forwards

the united kingdom subsidiary incurred a charge of  for income taxes due to its profitability 
however  the french subsidiary reported a net loss in  and so no tax provision was required due to utilization of that entity s net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million 
we have evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   we had no apparent near term ability to realize our deferred tax assets through carry backs or available tax planning strategies 
additionally  based on cumulative pre tax losses we have sustained in the three years ended december  and the current economic uncertainty in our industry that limits our ability to generate verifiable forecasts of future domestic taxable income  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to our deferred tax assets was recorded as of december  the valuation allowance increased by approximately million in and decreased by approximately million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents results compared to during  total revenues increased approximately million  or  from during  revenues from the sales of laser equipment and instrumentation increased to million  or of total net revenues  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in increases in revenues from sales of laser equipment and instrumentation resulted from a commensurate increase in unit shipments 
the united states distributor relationship which we formed with mckesson effective december contributed to the higher aesthetic laser sales 
this also enabled us to sell more instruments that are used with the aesthetic lasers 
mckesson made purchases from laserscope of approximately million and million which was and of our total and revenue  respectively 
in addition  we saw growth in unit shipments of greenlight pv tm lasers which are used for bph 
fiscal revenue shipments of greenlight pv lasers was units  which is an approximate three fold increase over the shipments of units 
net revenues from shipments of disposable supplies were higher in than  and were approximately million  or  of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues in these higher revenues are principally due to increasing demand for the disposable fiber optic devices which are used with the greenlight pv laser 
until recently  our sales had trended towards lower priced physician office based lasers for aesthetic procedures and away from lasers used in hospitals for non aesthetic procedures 
this resulted in lower sales of disposable supplies since office lasers used in aesthetic procedures  generally do not create a stream of sales of disposable supplies such as the addstat disposable fiber optic delivery device 
however  with the introduction of the greenlight tm laser system in early  we sold approximately  and  disposable fiber optic delivery devices in and respectively  which increased our disposables revenue 
service revenues were higher in than  and were approximately million  or of total revenues in  compared to million  or of revenue in service revenues increased in all geographic regions  but the growth rate was marginally higher at our foreign subsidiaries 
product gross margin as a percentage of net product revenues was in which was even with that of in  gross margin increased due to greenlight tm addstat fibers sold 
however  this was offset by less favorable manufacturing variances and higher warranty cost which was driven by longer warranty periods associated with promoting sales of greenlight tm laser systems 
gross margin from service activities as a percentage of net service revenues was in compared to in the decrease reflects an increase in material and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue 
research and development expenses result from activities related to the development of new laser  instrumentation and disposable products and the enhancement of our existing products 
in  amounts spent on research and development increased from amounts spent in this was primarily due to an increase in permanent staff and consultants to work on development of the new gemini laser as well as continuing refinements to the greenlight pv and aesthetic lasers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to this was due in part to an increase in headcount as we increased the size of our sales force and marketing staff in the united states and in our foreign subsidiaries primarily to promote the greenlight laser system 
in addition  commission expenses were higher following from an increase in revenue of both greenlight tm and aesthetic lasers 
in  we recorded an income tax provision of  our united kingdom subsidiary incurred a charge of  for income taxes due its profitability 
however  while the united states operations reported a profit  due to net operating loss carry forwards  the united states entity s tax liability was limited to the alternative minimum tax 
the french subsidiary reported a net loss in  and so no tax provision was required for that entity 
the united states and the french entity have significant net operating loss carry forwards 
in  we recorded a tax provision of  for our united kingdom subsidiary and recorded no 
table of contents tax provision for france 
in the united states in we recorded a tax provision of  for state tax  none for federal tax since tax law at that time permitted alternative minimum tax to be offset by tax loss carry forwards 
financial review liquidity and capital resources the following table contains selected balance sheet information at december  and in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents working capital total assets the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in compared to was due to cash provided by operating and financing activities  partially offset by cash used in investing activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million 
this was the combined result of the following sources net income million  an increase in accrued compensation million due to an increase in accrued salaries  wages and employee bonuses  an increase in deferred revenue million as a result of higher volume of contract revenue bookings and higher contractual obligations  which are the result of increased laser sales  an increase in other accrued liabilities million primarily due to higher customer rebates  audit and sarbanes oxley consulting costs coupled with accrued travel expenses  depreciation and amortization million  an increase in warranty reserve million as a result of higher laser sales  an increase in tax benefit of stock option exercises million  an increase in tax payable million 
these sources were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable million which was a result of higher sales volume  an increase in inventory million due to increased production to accommodate growing demand for products  a decrease in accounts payable million due to the timing of payments to suppliers  a decrease in provision for doubtful accounts million due to improved collection activities  a decrease in reserve for excess and obsolete inventory million  and an increase in prepayments and other current assets million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million 
this is the result of the sales of common stock under stock option plans  employee stock purchase plans and the exercise of warrants 
cash used in investing activities totaled million  of which million was due to capital expenditures 
a significant portion of total capital spending is attributable to in progress enterprise resourse planning erp costs 
additional spending was in office equipment  test and production equipment  licenses and intangibles  and capitalized laser systems used by service and research and development 
in addition  spending on acquisition of licenses or other intangibles totaled million 
laserscope has in place an asset based line of credit that provides up to million in borrowings and expires in september credit is extended based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
laserscope s assets collateralize the credit line which bears an interest rate equivalent to the bank s prime rate plus 
the prime rate at december  was 
borrowings against the line of credit are paid down as the company collects its accounts receivable 
provisions of the bank loan agreement prohibit the payment of dividends on non preferred stock  or the redemption  retirement  repurchase or other acquisition of laserscope stock 
the agreement further requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line and were in compliance with all covenants 
capital expenditures totaled million in and million in during  laserscope began the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp software 
although we will still be incurring costs related to the erp implementation  we expect the level of capital expenditures in to be lower than that of 
table of contents our research and development expenditures in and were million and million respectively 
we expect the amounts spent in research and development during will be higher in absolute terms than that spent in but lower as a percentage of net revenues 
in the first six months of   of the debentures were converted to  shares of laserscope common stock by renaissance 
during the last six months of  renaissance converted the remaining million of debentures into  shares of laserscope common stock 
we anticipate that future changes in cash and working capital will be dependent on a number of factors including our ability to effectively manage non cash assets such as inventory and accounts receivable  our ability to anticipate and adapt to the changes in our industry such as new and alternative medical procedures  our ability to scale efficiently the company s infrastructure to accommodate the current rapid growth in our business  our level of profitability  and our determination to acquire or invest in products and businesses complementary to ours 
we have historically financed acquisitions using our existing cash resources 
while we believe our existing cash resources  including our bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months  additional financing will likely be required for our currently envisioned long term needs 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  future equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders  and future debt financings could result in certain financial and operational restrictions contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases capital leases total off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions

risk factors in determining whether to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the information below in addition to all other information provided to you in this report  including the information incorporated by reference in this report 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose 
demand for our products in the united states and internationally is highly dependent on satisfactory reimbursement rates from private and governmental third party payers for procedures using our products 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain satisfactory reimbursement rates  demand for our products would decline and our business  financial results and cash flows would suffer 
the ability of our customers to obtain satisfactory reimbursement for our products and services using our products from government and third party payers is essential to our success 
demand for certain of our products depends on government and private insurance reimbursement of hospitals and physicians for health care costs  including  but not limited to  reimbursement of capital equipment costs 
reductions or delays in such insurance coverage or reimbursement may negatively impact hospitals  physicians and other health care providers decisions to purchase our products  adversely affecting our future sales 
a substantial portion of our laser sales are for aesthetic procedures that are generally not subject to reimbursement by government or private health insurance 
the general absence of insurance coverage for these cosmetic procedures may restrict the development of this market 
major third party payers for health care services such as the pvp procedure using the greenlight laser system in the united states  such as medicare  medicaid  private healthcare insurance and managed care plans  and in our key international markets such as the european union and the asia pacific region continue to work to contain healthcare costs 
public and private initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  are underway in the us and our key international markets 
implementation of healthcare reforms in these significant markets may limit the price of  or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products 
the current facility fee reimbursement for pvp in the united states could be reduced  eliminated or utilized by a competitor 
demand in the united states for our greenlight laser system and disposable fibers is highly dependent on the reimbursement rate established for the pvp procedure when it is performed in the hospital site of service  which is established by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms under an ambulatory payment classification apc reimbursement code 
the apc code applicable to the pvp procedure has varied in recent years 
in november  cms announced its final rule with respect to apc reimbursement codes to be implemented in january one of the apc codes  known as the facility fee  that was affected was used by hospitals to bill medicare for the pvp procedure 
in february  cms issued a technical correction to this apc code which represented the reimbursement under this code for the reimbursement rate for this code reduced the amount paid to the hospital for the pvp procedure by approximately for the hospital site of service for medicare patients compared to the reimbursement during in november  cms notified laserscope that its application for assignment of pvp to a new technology apc had been accepted 
cms determined that pvp met the new technology apc qualification criteria and assigned a new apc code effective april  for pvp and other similar procedures 
the national average facility fee reimbursement rate under the new technology apc is  the rate is 
table of contents scheduled to be maintained until march   at which time cms may assign a new reimbursement value to the procedure based on data accumulated during the two year assessment period or may re assign pvp to an existing apc code 
there can be no assurance that the current rate will be maintained  raised or lowered 
additionally  the new technology apc is not solely specific to laserscope s products and can be used by other technologies that meet the requirements of the apc coding guidelines 
if a competitor were able to obtain reimbursement under the current apc code for the pvp procedure using its product  demand for our product could be reduced and our financial results could suffer 
physician fee schedule reimbursement for pvp in the united states remains uncertain 
demand in the us for our greenlight laser system and disposable fibers is also highly dependent on the physician reimbursement rates applicable to the pvp procedure under the national physician s fee schedule determined by cms 
we believe that physicians may obtain reimbursement for pvp procedures pursuant to the fee schedule under two reimbursement codes  including one applicable to the office site of service and the other applicable to the hospital or ambulatory surgery site of service 
each of these reimbursement codes may not provide physicians a reimbursement level and reimbursement structure reflecting the actual time  effort and resource costs associated with the procedure  which would discourage physicians from performing the pvp procedure 
should cms reduce the current codes under the fee schedule relative to other procedures it will likely negatively affect pvp adoption 
failure to adequately and fairly reimburse physicians  hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for the pvp procedure in all sites of service will impair adoption of the pvp procedure  reduce demand for our products and harm our financial performance 
cms reimbursement decisions regarding the physician fee schedule for pvp in any site of service remain uncertain and could result in maintenance of the current reimbursement structure or a decrease in reimbursement rates  or an upward adjustment  affecting pvp procedural volume and sales of our products 
pvp physician reimbursement is typically lower  on a per procedure basis  compared to other bph therapies 
the current national average rate of reimbursement paid to physicians for performing the pvp procedure on a per procedure basis is  in some cases  substantially lower than the reimbursement rate paid for performing certain other bph therapies on a per procedure basis 
while we believe that this disparity results in physicians and hospitals not being reimbursed commensurate with the necessary resources and work required to do the pvp procedure in all sites of service currently being used by physicians  there can be no assurance that cms will adjust reimbursement rates to address this disparity 
further  there can be no assurance that physician reimbursement for these other therapies will not be maintained at current levels or raised relative to reimbursement for pvp or that the physician reimbursement for pvp will be maintained at current levels or increased relative to other bph therapies 
the adoption rate of the pvp procedure in the united states is highly dependent upon hospital and physician economics 
a substantial reduction in either the facility fee and or a continuation of the disparity which currently exists between the physician reimbursement for certain other bph therapies and that for pvp could cause a reduction in the adoption of pvp by hospitals and physicians  which would reduce demand for our products and harm our business 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property adequately  we will lose a critical competitive advantage  which will reduce our revenues  profits and cash flows 
our patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property are critical to our success 
we hold several patents issued in the united states  generally covering surgical laser systems  delivery devices  calibration inserts and the laser resonator 
we have also licensed certain technologies from others 
we cannot assure that any patents or licenses that we hold or that may be issued as a result of our patent applications will provide any competitive advantages for our products 
nor can we assure that any of the patents that we now hold or may hold in the future will not be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure that competitors  many of which have substantial 
table of contents resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  will not seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  issue  use and sell our products 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we have not attempted to secure patent protection in foreign countries  and the laws of some foreign countries may not adequately protect our ip as well as the laws of the united states 
as we increase our international presence  we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor the development of competing technologies that may infringe on our rights as well as unauthorized use of our technologies 
we believe that we own or have the right to use the basic patents covering our products 
however  the laser industry is characterized by a very large number of patents  many of which are of questionable validity and some of which appear to overlap with other issued patents 
as a result  there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the industry regarding patent protection and infringement 
because patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the united states until such patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a period of time outside the united states  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications of others 
if we are unable to protect the integrity  safety and proper use of our addstat disposable fiber optic delivery device with the greenlight laser system  it could result in negative patient outcomes and reduce our disposable fiber recurring revenue stream 
ensuring the integrity  safety and proper use of the addstat disposable fiber optical delivery device  referred to elsewhere in this report as the disposable fiber  used with the greenlight laser system is crucial to achieving optimal patient outcomes from the pvp procedure 
with this is mind  we manufacture the addstat fiber using high quality materials and exacting production standards 
we inspect each unit carefully to check that it conforms to our specifications and use diligent efforts to ensure that the disposable fiber is used appropriately in connection with the greenlight laser system 
however  if a third party were to produce and distribute a counterfeit version of the addstat fiber or an inferior substitute fiber to our customers  use of inferior materials  poor design  shoddy construction or improper handling or use of such products could result in severe adverse patient events 
while we are constantly making diligent efforts to promote positive clinical outcomes by protecting the safety  integrity and proper use of our products  particularly the addstat fiber  one or more third party manufacturers may produce counterfeit or inferior quality fibers that our customers may  knowingly or unknowingly  purchase for use with the greenlight laser system 
in addition  it is possible that our customers may seek to violate our prohibition on reuse of fibers or reuse inferior substitute fibers on unwitting patients  reducing the efficacy of the procedure and exposing such patients to the risk of blood borne pathogens such as hiv or hepatitis c 
use of such third party fibers or misuse of our genuine addstat fibers could result in adverse clinical outcomes  reducing demand for pvp and decreasing demand for our products 
we use a variety of methods to protect patients from inferior fibers and the reuse of our addstat disposable fibers  including legal and regulatory safeguards  system enabling  patient education and safety packaging among other measures 
moreover  use of counterfeit or substitute disposable fibers for use with the greenlight laser system or unauthorized reuse of fibers  would displace sales of our addstat disposable fibers reducing our recurring disposable fiber revenue stream and harming our business 
we participate in competitive markets with companies that have significantly greater technical  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and or who produce standard  entrenched medical technologies 
we compete in the non ophthalmic surgical segment of the worldwide medical laser market 
in this market  lasers are used in hospital operating rooms  outpatient surgery centers and individual physician offices for a wide variety of procedures 
this market is highly competitive 
our competitors are numerous and include 
table of contents some of the world s largest organizations as well as smaller  highly specialized firms 
our ability to compete effectively depends on such factors as market acceptance of our products  product performance  price  customer support  the success and timing of new product development  and continued development of successful distribution channels 
some of our current and prospective competitors have or may have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
to compete effectively  we will need to continue to expand our product offerings  periodically enhance our existing products and continue to enhance our distribution 
certain surgical laser manufacturers have targeted their efforts on narrow segments of the market  such as angioplasty  orthopedics  and lithotripsy 
their products may compete for the same capital equipment funds as our products  and accordingly  these manufacturers may be considered our competitors 
generally  surgical laser manufacturers such as laserscope compete with standard surgical methods and other medical technologies and treatment modalities 
we cannot assure that we can compete effectively against such competitors 
in addition  we cannot assure that these or other companies will not succeed in developing technologies  products or treatments that are more effective than ours or that would render our technology or products obsolete or non competitive 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our business may be harmed 
our future success depends on our ability to successfully manage our growth 
our ability to manage our business successfully in a rapidly evolving and extremely competitive market requires an effective planning and management process 
our rates of growth in recent years have been high 
should our business continue to grow and demand for our products continue to increase at similar rates  it will increase the strain on our personnel in all aspects of our business 
our historical growth  international expansion  and our strategy of being the provider of the leading solutions for the treatment of bph and aesthetic laser surgery  have placed  and are expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial and financial resources as well as our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
although some new controls  systems and procedures have been implemented  our future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis  together with maintaining effective cost controls 
our inability to manage any future growth effectively would be harmful to our revenues and profitability 
our dependence on certain single source suppliers and certain other third parties  could adversely impact our ability to manufacture lasers 
certain of the components used in our laser products  including certain optical components  are purchased from single sources 
while we believe that most of these components are available from alternate sources  an interruption of these or other supplies could adversely affect our ability to manufacture lasers 
problems associated with international business operations could affect our ability to sell our products 
as our international business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from the unique and potentially adverse factors in the countries in which we operate 
our international revenues were of total revenues in the year ended december  and in the year end december  our international sales are made through international distributors and wholly owned subsidiaries with payments 
table of contents to us typically denominated in the local currencies of the united kingdom and france  and in united states dollars in the rest of the world 
we intend to continue our operations outside of the united states and potentially to enter additional international markets  we anticipate that sales to customers located outside north america will increase and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
these activities  require significant management attention and financial resources and further subject us to the risks of operating internationally 
these risks include  but are not limited to changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  customs  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with our international operations  such as differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and war 
in addition  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our ability to compete in terms of price against products denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  if these risks actually materialize  our international operations may be adversely affected and sales to international customers  as well as those domestic customers that use foreign fabrication plants  may decrease we do not engage in hedging transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
our business has significant risks of product liability claims  which could drain our resources and exceed our insurance coverage which is limited 
our business has significant risks of product liability claims 
we have experienced product liability claims from time to time  which we believe are ordinary for our business 
while we cannot predict or determine the outcome of the actions brought against us  we believe that these actions will not ultimately have a material adverse impact on laserscope s financial position  results of operations  and future cash flows 
at present  we maintain product liability insurance on a claims made basis with coverage of million in the aggregate with a deductible of million per occurrence and an annual maximum aggregate deductible of million 
we cannot assure that such insurance coverage will be available to us in the future at a reasonable cost  if at all 
nor can we assure that other claims will not be brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage 
our products are subject to government regulation  and so we cannot assure that all necessary regulatory approvals  including approvals for new products or product improvements  will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  and that we won t be subject to product recalls or warnings and other regulatory actions and penalties that could materially affect our operating results 
government regulation in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacturing and marketing of many of our products 
laserscope and its products are regulated in the united states by the food and drug administration under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act and the radiation control for health and safety act 
the fdc act provides two basic review procedures for medical devices 
certain products qualify for a section k k procedure under which the manufacturer gives the fda pre market notification of the manufacturer s intention to commence marketing the product 
the manufacturer must  
table of contents among other things  establish that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to a previously marketed product 
in some cases  the manufacturer may be required to include clinical data gathered under an investigational device exemption ide granted by the fda allowing human clinical studies 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant marketing clearance for our future products on a timely basis  or at all 
if the product does not qualify for the k procedure  the manufacturer must file a pre market approval application pma based on testing intended to demonstrate that the product is both safe and effective 
the pma requires more extensive clinical testing than the k procedure and generally involves a significantly longer fda review process 
approval of a pma allowing commercial sale of a product requires pre clinical laboratory and animal tests and human clinical studies conducted under an ide establishing safety and effectiveness 
generally  because of the amount of information required  the k procedure takes less time than the pma procedure 
to date  all of our products except for the series dye module have been marketed through the k procedure 
future products  however  may require clearance through the pma procedure 
there can be no assurance that such marketing clearances can be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
delays in receiving such clearances could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to compete in our industry 
the fda may also require post market testing and surveillance programs to monitor certain products 
certain other countries require medical device manufacturers to obtain clearances for products prior to marketing the products in those countries 
the requirements vary widely from country to country and are subject to change 
obtaining necessary regulatory approvals in key international markets and retaining such regulatory licenses is essential to international expansion of our business  which is an important strategic objective 
we are also required to register with the fda and state agencies  such as the food and drug branch of the california department of health services cdhs  as a medical device manufacturer 
we are inspected routinely by these agencies to determine our compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice regulations 
those regulations impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon medical device manufacturers concerning manufacturing  testing and quality control activities 
if these inspections determine violations of applicable regulations  the continued marketing of any products manufactured by us may be adversely affected 
in addition  our laser products are covered by a performance standard for laser products set forth in fda regulations 
the laser performance standard imposes certain specific record keeping  reporting  product testing  and product labeling requirements on laser manufacturers 
these requirements also include affixing warning labels to laser systems  as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products 
complying with applicable governmental regulations and obtaining necessary clearances or approvals can be time consuming and expensive 
there can be no assurance that regulatory review will not involve delays or other actions adversely affecting the marketing and sale of our products in the united states and internationally 
we also cannot predict the extent or impact of future legislation or regulations in the united states and abroad 
we are also subject to regulation under federal and state laws regarding  among other things  occupational safety  the use and handling of hazardous materials and protection of the environment 
while we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements  noncompliance with any such requirements 
as we have limited working capital  we may need additional capital that may not be available to us and  if raised  may dilute our stockholders ownership interest in us 
we may need to raise additional funds to develop or enhance our technologies  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 

table of contents as of december   our total assets were million and our total liabilities were million 
as of the same date  our working capital was million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
current and anticipated demand for our products as well as procurement and production affect our need for capital 
changes in these or other factors could have a material impact on capital requirements and may require us to raise additional capital 
for example  to address our capital needs  on january  we completed a private placement of our common stock providing net proceeds of approximately million to accredited investors 
we issued million shares of our no par value common stock at a price of per share 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
similarly  on february   we completed a private placement of subordinate convertible debentures pursuant to regulation d of the securities act of  as amended  to affiliates of renaissance with gross proceeds to laserscope of million 
the debentures were to mature seven years from issuance and had an interest rate of 
the debentures were convertible into laserscope common stock with an initial conversion price  which was subject to adjustment  of 
the private placement also included warrants convertible into  shares of laserscope common stock at per share and expire in in the first six months of   of the debentures were converted to  shares of laserscope common stock by renaissance 
during the last six months of  renaissance converted the remaining million of debentures into  shares of laserscope common stock 
in  except for shares issued through the company s employee stock purchase plan and the incentive stock option plans  the only other capital raised was through the exercise of warrants  which resulted in the issuance of  shares 
we anticipate that future changes in cash and working capital will be dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage effectively non cash assets such as inventory and accounts receivable  our ability to anticipate and adapt to the changes in our industry such as new and alternative medical procedures  our level of profitability  and our determination to acquire or invest in products and businesses complementary to ours 
we have historically financed acquisitions using our existing cash resources 
while we believe our existing cash resources  including our bank line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months  additional financing may be required for our currently envisioned long term needs 
additional financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
we may have difficulty sustaining profitability and may experience additional losses in the future 
although we recorded net income of million  million  and million for fiscal years   and respectively  prior to  we had prolonged periods of consecutive quarterly net losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in order to maintain and improve our profitability  we will need to continue to generate new sales while controlling our costs 
as we plan on continuing the growth of our business while implementing cost control measures  we may not be able to successfully generate enough revenues to remain profitable with this growth 
any failure to increase our revenues and control costs as we pursue our planned growth would harm our profitability and would likely negatively affect the market price of our stock 

table of contents we may be unable to respond to the rapid technological changes that often affect the markets in which we compete 
if we fail to rapidly develop  manufacture and market technologically innovative products at acceptable costs  our operating results will suffer 
we operate in an industry that is subject to rapid technological change 
our ability to remain competitive and future operating results will depend upon  among other things  our ability to anticipate and respond rapidly to such change by developing  manufacturing and marketing technologically innovative products in sufficient quantities at acceptable costs to meet such demand 
as we introduce new products this may cause some of our existing products to become obsolete  which may result in the write off of inventory 
however  without new products and enhancements  our existing products will likely become obsolete due to technological advances by other companies  which could result in the write off of inventory as well as diminished revenues 
therefore  we intend to continue to invest significant amounts in research and development 
our expenditures for research and development were million in  million and million in each year of and  respectively 
we anticipate that our ability to compete will require significant research and development expenditures with a continuing flow of innovative  high quality products 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in designing  manufacturing or selling enhanced or new products in a timely manner 
nor can we assure that a competitor could not introduce a new or enhanced product or technology that could have an adverse effect on our competitive position 
our current research and development programs are directed toward the development of new laser systems and delivery devices 
we cannot assure that these markets will develop as anticipated or that our product development efforts will prove successful 
nor can we assure that such new products  if developed and introduced  will be accepted by the market 
we may become a party to a patent infringement and other intellectual property related actions or disputes  which could result in significant royalty or other payments or in injunctions that can prevent the sale of our products 
our industry has been characterized by frequent patent infringement and other intellectual property related action  including demands for licenses and litigation 
our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our products and the methods we employ are covered by their patents 
in addition  we do not know whether our competitors will apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use  sell or import our products 
although we may seek to resolve any potential future claims or actions  we may not be able to do so on reasonable terms  or at all 
if  following a successful third party action for infringement  we cannot obtain a license or redesign our products  we may have to stop manufacturing and marketing our products  and our business would suffer as a result 
we may become involved in litigation not only as a result of alleged infringement of a third party s intellectual property rights but also to protect our own intellectual property 
we have and may hereafter become involved in litigation to protect the trademark rights associated with our company name or the names of our products 
if we have to change the name of our products  we may experience a loss in goodwill associated with customer confusion and a loss of sales 
infringement and other intellectual property related claims  with or without merit  can be expensive and time consuming to litigate  and could divert management s attention from our core business 
we do not know whether necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or whether we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement 
if we lose this kind of litigation  a court could require us to pay substantial damages  and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents any acquisitions we make may not provide us the expected benefits and could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
any acquisitions we make may not provide us the expected benefits and could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have acquired businesses and technologies in the past  and we may continue to acquire businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
any future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  the integration of acquisition targets may prove to be more difficult than expected  and we may be unsuccessful in maintaining and developing relations with the employees  customers and business partners and other acquisition targets 
since we will not be able to accurately predict these difficulties and expenditures  it is possible that these costs may outweigh the value we realize from a future acquisition 
future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders ownership interest  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities  deferred stock based compensation or expenses related to the valuation of goodwill or other intangible assets and the incurrence of large  immediate write offs 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel who are critical to the success of our business our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain engineers and other highly skilled personnel and senior managers 
in addition  in order to meet our planned growth we must increase our sales force  both domestic and international  with qualified employees 
hiring qualified technical  sales and management personnel is difficult due to a limited number of qualified professionals and competition in our industry for these types of employees 
we have in the past experienced delays and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel and believe that at times our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and start up companies 
our employees are at will and may leave our employment at any time 
as a result  we may experience significant employee turnover 
failure to attract and retain personnel  particularly sales and technical personnel would make it difficult for us to develop and market our technologies 
in addition  our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key personnel  including eric reuter  our president and chief executive officer  bob mathews  group vice president  operations and product development  and robert mann  group vice president  worldwide sales and marketing 
we do not have formal employment agreements with messrs 
reuter  mathews and mann and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on their lives 
if such individuals were to leave or become unable to perform services for our company  our business could be severely harmed 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations for any fiscal quarter may cause our stock price to decline 
a number of factors affect our quarterly financial results including the timing of shipments and orders 
our laser products are relatively expensive pieces of medical capital equipment and the precise shipment date of specific units can have a marked effect on our results of operations on a quarterly basis 
additionally  our fiber optic disposable devices are relatively complex assemblies requiring components that can have long lead times 
failure of suppliers to provide materials in a timely manner or other disruptions in the continuous production of these fiber optics components could have a substantially marked effect on our results of operations on a quarterly basis 
any delay in product shipments near the end of a quarter could cause our quarterly results to fall short of anticipated levels 
furthermore  to the extent we receive orders near the end of a quarter  we may not be able to fulfill the order during the balance of that same quarter 
moreover  we typically receive a disproportionate percentage of orders toward the end of each quarter 
to the extent that we do not receive anticipated orders or orders are delayed beyond the end of the applicable quarter  our results may be adversely affected and may be unpredictable from quarter to quarter 
in addition  because a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter  we base our production  inventory and operating expenditure levels on anticipated revenue levels 
thus  if sales do not occur when expected  expenditure levels could be disproportionately high and operating results for that quarter and 
table of contents potentially future quarters  would be adversely affected 
we cannot assure that laserscope will accomplish revenue growth or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
nor can we assure that revenue growth or profitability will not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if we are unable to continue our relationship with mckesson on favorable contractual terms  our business may be harmed 
in december  laserscope and mckesson entered into a five year agreement whereby mckesson would obtain exclusive distribution rights for the company s aesthetic product lines to doctors offices in the united states 
during  sales to mckesson accounted for approximately of our total revenues and at december   accounts receivable from mckesson accounted for approximately of our total accounts receivable 
if we are unable to maintain a favorable relationship with mckesson or if mckesson encounters financial difficulties  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and future cashflows 
if our products contain defects that harm our customers patients  it would damage our reputation  subject us to potential legal liability and cause us to lose customers and revenue 
laser systems and fiber optic delivery devices are inherently complex in design and manufacturing 
laser systems require ongoing regular maintenance 
the manufacture of our lasers  laser products  disposable delivery devices  and systems involve highly complex and precise processes 
as a result of the technical complexity of our products  changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability 
to the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability  our business  operating results  financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected 
our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition some of our products are combined with products from other vendors  which may contain defects 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  increased costs of product  returns and warranty expenses  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our financial results and stock price are affected by a number of factors which are beyond our control 
a number of factors affect our financial results and stock price including  but not limited to product mix  competitive pricing pressures  material costs  revenue and expenses related to new products and enhancements to existing products  
table of contents delays in customer purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by laserscope or its competitors  and the risk of loss or interruption to our operations or increased costs due to earthquakes  the availability of power and energy supplies and other events beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to laserscope  such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  changes in analysts estimates of future results  changes in investors perceptions of our products  announcement of new or enhanced products by us or our competitors  announcements relating to acquisitions and strategic transactions by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical equipment industry  and general conditions in the financial markets 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly among stocks of high technology companies  which  on occasion  have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
factors not directly related to laserscope s performance  such as negative industry reports or disappointing earnings announcements by publicly traded competitors  may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of outstanding common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
we are a party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
laserscope is a party to a number of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of the actions brought against us  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will not ultimately have a material adverse effect on laserscope s financial position  results of operations  or future cash flows 
we typically assume warranty obligations in connection with the sales of our products  which could cause a significant drain on our resources if our products perform poorly 
we have a direct field service organization that provides service for our products 
we generally provide a twelve month warranty on our laser systems 
after the warranty period  maintenance and support is provided on a service contract basis or on an individual call basis 
our warranties and premium service contracts provide for a uptime guarantee on our laser systems 
under provisions of this guarantee  at the request of the customer  we extend the term of the related warranty or service contract if specified system uptime levels are not maintained 
natural catastrophic events  such as earthquakes  or terrorist attacks may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
our corporate headquarters  including our research and development operations  our manufacturing facilities  and our principal sales  marketing and service offices  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or a flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer 
table of contents viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september  disrupted commerce throughout the world and intensified the uncertainty of the united states and other economies 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to these economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
no dividends 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
the payment of dividends on the common stock will depend on our earnings  financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant 
the exercise of outstanding options and warrants granted under laserscope s stock option plans and other options and warrants may result in dilution of our shareholders equity interests 
shareholders may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants granted under laserscope s stock option plans and other options and warrants 
other risks 
other risks are detailed from time to time in our press releases and other public disclosure filings with the united states securities and exchange commission sec  copies of which are available upon request from the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on investments  outstanding debt balances and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents 
in and  we did not use derivative financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in money market funds 
our debt financings generally consisted of convertible debentures and bank loans requiring either fixed or variable rate interest payments 
investments in and borrowings under both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
on the investment side  fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
in addition  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
on the debt side  borrowings that require fixed rate interest payments require greater than current market rate interest payments if interest rates fall  while floating rate borrowings may require greater interest 
table of contents payments if interest rates rise 
additionally  our future interest expense may be greater than expected due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk international revenues were approximately of total revenues in and of total revenues in and our international sales are made through international distributors and wholly owned subsidiaries with payments to us typically denominated in the local currencies of the united kingdom and france  and in united states dollars in the rest of the world 
we intend to continue our operations outside of the united states and potentially to enter additional international markets 
these activities  require significant management attention and financial resources and further subject us to the risks of operating internationally 
these risks include  but are not limited to changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  customs  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with our international operations  such as differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and war 
in addition  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our ability to compete in terms of price against products denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulatory  geopolitical and other factors 
we do not engage in hedging transactions for speculative or trading purposes
