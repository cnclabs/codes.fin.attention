no individual client accounted for more than of annual revenue for the three years ended february  the company was incorporated in delaware in our fiscal year end is february th or th 
we completed our initial public offering of common stock in  a secondary public offering of common stock in and a private placement of convertible subordinated notes in we subsequently registered the convertible subordinated notes for resale early in fiscal we have invested significant resources to develop new software  to enhance existing software and to acquire additional software products and solutions through acquisitions 
a summary of our acquisitions over the past five fiscal years follows company date description digital freight exchange  inc dfe may collaborative transportation logistics services western data systems of nevada  inc wds april maintenance  repair and overhaul and make to order software spaceworks inc acquired technology only july order management software partminer csd  inc may product design and sourcing software one release  llc may software development services stg holdings  inc stg january advanced factory planning  scheduling and simulation software talus solutions  inc talus december pricing and revenue optimization software asset acquisitions industry background increasing global competition  shorter product life cycles  more demanding customers and higher standards are forcing businesses to be more responsive to customer demand  bring their products to market more quickly and efficiently  provide improved levels of customer service  and improve margins by lowering costs to market and improving pricing decisions 
to meet these challenges  companies are demanding greater visibility of operations throughout their own organization and their extended trading networks and the capability to make and execute decisions in response to rapidly changing conditions of demand and supply 
effective demand and supply chain management solutions allow companies to share information throughout their own organizations and extended trading networks and to monitor  measure and improve their business processes over time 
they also enable informed  responsive  rapid decision making that is cost and price effective 
we believe that traditional enterprise application systems  such as enterprise resource planning erp systems  do not provide the visibility  flexibility  responsiveness or efficiencies required to meet effectively the demands of today s competitive environment 
we believe that companies need to pursue the integration of the supply side and demand side of their businesses to lower operational costs and increase the value derived from their processes and technology systems 
to meet these challenges  many companies are seeking information technology solutions based on open standards that operate in a fast  effective and secure environment and can be integrated with their existing systems  as well as those of the companies in their trading networks 
they require that these solutions provide quick realization of benefits and rapid return on their systems investments 
the competition in these markets includes enterprise application software companies  such as traditional erp companies and other transaction based application software companies  supply chain management companies  pricing and revenue management companies and other information technology services companies  in addition to software solutions custom developed within the user company 
information technology companies are engaging offshore global workforces on an increasing basis to take advantage of technical expertise and lower personnel costs in countries such as india and china 
companies may utilize their own or out sourced operations to provide development  consulting and implementation services

software license  support and implementation service agreements and pricing software revenue consists principally of fees generated from licensing our software products 
in consideration of the payment of license fees  we generally grant nonexclusive  nontransferable  perpetual licenses  which are primarily business unit  user specific and geographically restricted 
software license fee arrangements vary depending upon the type of software product s being licensed and the customer s computer environment 
software license fees are based primarily on which products are licensed  the size and complexity of the customer problem being addressed  the size of the client s business and the number of users and locations 
the amount of software license fees may reach many millions of dollars for initiatives that are large in scope and complexity 
clients may obtain solution support for an annual fee 
our clients may select from three levels of support that our customers choose from to accommodate their needs standard  premium and signature 
support fees are calculated on an escalated scale  based on the level of service chosen and the size of the related software license fees 
support fees are generally billed annually and are subject to changes in support list prices 
we also provide implementation services  training and hosting of our software applications and other related services  generally on a time and materials basis

if we are unable to continue to license certain of this software on commercially reasonable terms  including the reporting software from cognos and the application platform suite from bea systems  we may face delays in releases of certain of our software solutions until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our current product

overview business and products we are a leading global provider of supply chain management and demand and revenue management software products and services 
we combine these products and services to deliver solutions that address specific business needs of our clients 
our solutions enable our clients to reduce operating costs  improve customer service and increase their top line revenue by allowing them to plan  optimize and synchronize their entire demand and supply chain and to improve their revenue management practices 
these benefits create efficiencies in how goods and services are brought to market  how they are priced and sold and how they are serviced and maintained 
our software solutions provide the further benefit of simultaneously optimizing cost and revenue on an enterprise wide basis by integrating pricing  forecasting  operational planning and execution  enhancing margins across the client s enterprise and extended trading network 
in addition  our software solutions help our clients derive more benefits from their existing it investments with other software vendors  such as legacy erp and other transaction based systems  and help ensure the security and integrity of their global supply chains 
our approach to client delivery is to advise our clients how to best use our solutions and other technologies across their entire demand and supply chain to integrate pricing  forecasting  operational planning and execution in a manner that will allow them to enhance margins across their entire enterprise and extended trading network and to improve their revenue management practices 
we deliver our solutions using commercially available products and will provide additional functionality addressed through product extensions for industry specific capabilities 
certain of our clients and prospects are also asking for unique capabilities on top of our core capabilities to give them a competitive edge in the market place which we may provide on a case by case basis 
in these instances  this could lead to an increase in software license revenue being recognized on a contract accounting basis over the course of the delivery of the solution rather than upon delivery and contract execution 
we are also entering new markets such as china  which require that software license revenue be recognized over the period that services and support are performed 
we are primarily focused on the consumer goods  retail  and government  aerospace defense markets 
we are also focused on providing revenue management solutions for the travel  transportation hospitality markets 
business environment and factors that affected our fiscal year ended february  results our operating results for the past three fiscal years were affected by several broad based factors including global macro economic conditions and cautious capital spending by corporations  especially for information technology such as enterprise application software 
we believe changing conditions over the last three fiscal years caused changes in the behavior patterns in our markets as our clients and prospects intensified their efforts to reduce costs 
many shifted their focus from longer term strategic initiatives to short term tactical initiatives with more rapid paybacks 
we also believe that our clients and prospects are focused on realizing benefits from earlier investments in information technology 
in addition  we believe that some of our clients and prospects are still deferring capital spending on enterprise application software in part as a result of the challenges they have faced in complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and other related regulatory requirements 
we believe that our financial results in the fiscal year ended february  were also affected by the magnitude of changes in our workforce  including our executive management and sales organization  difficulties in execution  a market focus that was too broad for existing market conditions and a strong competitive environment 
as a result  over the past three fiscal years we have faced challenges in our ability to stabilize revenue and improve our operating performance 
in addition to the trends in our operating environment  we also recognize that our performance did not meet our expectations 
as previously announced  during our second quarter of fiscal we developed and began executing plans to improve our overall financial performance  which we discuss in more detail below 
focus on future improvements in our financial performance in response to our recent financial performance  we continue to make focused changes within our business to reduce cost and improve our financial performance 
these changes include  among others  the continued development of a more focused product and market strategy and strategic restructuring of the organization  and efforts to reduce our operating expenses to a level that may allow us to become profitable 
during fiscal and march  we hired a new chief executive officer  a chief technology officer and a vice president of mid markets  consolidated our senior management team  eliminating several positions including that of president  and organized into business units to address the consumer goods  retail  government  aerospace defense and revenue management markets 
in two european countries where we do not presently have a critical mass of resources  we eliminated certain offices  which are now being serviced from other locations in the region 
we also intend to provide more focused sales and marketing efforts to small and medium sized business in europe and the asia pacific region through third party marketing and reseller agreements 
as part of these initiatives  in our second quarter of fiscal  we approved and began to implement exit and disposal plans 
as of february   we had achieved quarterly cost savings of approximately million  compared to the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of these initiatives 
these exit and disposal plans included the abandonment of certain office space and related asset write offs and the involuntary termination of employees 
we recorded exit and disposal charges of million in the twelve months ended february  related to these cost cutting initiatives  including million in lease abandonment and related asset write offs and million in severance and other benefits related to headcount reductions 
we have completed most of the planned initiatives approved in our second quarter exit and disposal plans and will complete the remainder of the initiatives in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we commenced operations at our new product development center in hyderabad  india 
we intend to move a substantial portion of our product development capabilities to our new facility over the course of the next year while keeping our core product development capabilities at our headquarters in rockville  maryland 
we believe this will allow us to both increase our product development resources and to lower our product development costs 
if market conditions for our products and services do not improve  we may need to make further adjustments to our cost structure to improve performance 
summary of fiscal operating results and financial metrics as we entered fiscal  difficult market conditions continued 
certain industries have been more or less likely to invest in enterprise application software depending on the condition of their business and industry 
our customers generally licensed fewer software modules in fiscal than in past years 
we have not lost any major customers in recent quarters that had a negative material impact on revenue 
our cost containment and cost reduction measures enacted in fiscal and fiscal have lessened the adverse impact on our financial performance of our declining revenue 
during fiscal  our employee workforce decreased from employees to employees  or  while total revenue declined compared to the same period 
key financial metrics fiscal our fiscal results and key financial metrics were negatively affected by decreased revenue  however  we have made progress in decreasing our operating costs  particularly in the second half of fiscal the following is a summary of our performance relative to certain key financial metrics during fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as a summary of our quarterly performance in fiscal year ended february or  year ended february  q q q q in thousands  except number of employees and dso revenue software support services reimbursed expenses total revenue operating expenses and employee headcount exit and disposal activities and acquisition related expenses all other operating expenses total operating expenses total employees period end total average employees total revenue per average employee financial condition  liquidity and capital structure cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments days sales outstanding dso convertible debt total stockholders equity common shares outstanding period end cash flows from operating activities includes exit and disposal activities plus acquisition related expenses such as amortization of acquired technology and intangibles and non cash stock option compensation expense 
includes cost of software  cost of support and services  cost of reimbursed expenses  sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative costs 
the following is a brief discussion of the above financial metrics and analysis of the reasons for the changes between fiscal and fiscal and recent trends 
software revenue our software revenue decreased during fiscal by to million 
the following table highlights some of the significant trends impacting our software revenue average software significant selling price transactions software asp million quarter ended transactions in s or greater may  august  november  february  may  august  november  february  fiscal total fiscal total significant software transactions are those with a value of  or greater recognized within the fiscal quarter 
software revenue by industry for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal is as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february or  government  aerospace defense consumer goods revenue management retail other the previous tables indicate the following trends affecting our software revenue over the past two fiscal years the number of significant software transactions consummated during each of the quarters and in all of fiscal was significantly fewer than the number of significant software transactions consummated during each of the same periods in fiscal the average selling price asp of software has been relatively stable during the past seven quarters 
asp has ranged from  to  during this period 
the asp for the quarter ended may  was significantly higher than the past seven quarters as it included software revenue from installments under a large multi year government contract 
software revenue declined for all industries with the exception of an increase in the retail and revenue management industries during fiscal compared to fiscal we believe the increase in our revenue from the retail industry in the past two fiscal years is partially a result of the efforts by retailers to compete more effectively with wal mart through increased investments in information technology 
in addition  retailers have benefited from increased consumer spending which has enabled them to increase their investments in information technology 
the increase in revenue in the revenue management industry other than airlines reflects a recovery in travel  transportation and hospitality  following a few years of decreased spending in these areas following the september  terrorist attack 
software revenue in the government  aerospace defense industry decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal  after having increased significantly in fiscal we believe the decline in our government  aerospace defense software revenue resulted from the federal government shifting monies especially within the department of defense to the war on terror 
the increase in software revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from i continued spending by the united states department of defense on business modernization initiatives  including procuring and installing commercial off the shelf software  such as supply chain management software  to replace legacy applications and processes and ii increased sales to aerospace and defense customers acquired in the acquisition of wds assets in april software revenue in the consumer goods industry decreased in fiscal compared to the fiscal we believe that the decrease in consumer goods spending is due to lack of capital spending by these customers who are now largely focused on realizing benefits from earlier investments in information technology rather than investing in new capabilities 
in addition  we believe that some consumer goods prospects have delayed purchasing decisions due to budget constraints and challenges in complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and other regulatory requirements 
support revenue our support revenue was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our percentage of annual support renewals by our clients remains high  however  decreases in support revenue from non renewals was not fully offset by increases in support revenue from new software sales during fiscal services and reimbursed expense revenue our services and reimbursed expense revenue decreased in fiscal to million 
services revenue tends to track software revenue in prior periods 
as such  we primarily attribute the decrease in services revenue to the decrease in the number of completed software license transactions in fiscal additionally  we experienced competitive rate pressures on consulting engagements and a decrease in the number of consulting employees who generate services revenue  from both voluntary and involuntary terminations in fiscal we have also experienced a decrease in services margin during the past two fiscal years  primarily due to lower volume and lower margins on fixed fee arrangements and services performed on non revenue generating activities 
total revenue per average employee our total revenue per average employee decreased by to  for fiscal calculated as total revenue for the year divided by average employees for the year 
this decrease was due to lower software and services revenue in fiscal partially offset by a decrease in total employee headcount in fiscal total operating expenses our total operating expenses declined by during fiscal to million 
exit and disposal activities and acquisition related expenses declined during fiscal to million 
this decrease was the result of lower exit and disposal charges in fiscal as compared to fiscal as well as the completed amortization of non cash stock option compensation expense in the second quarter of fiscal related to the unvested portion of stock options assumed with the acquisition of talus 
all other operating expenses declined during fiscal to million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in average employee headcount and reduced office space costs as a result of exit and disposal plans executed during fiscal and fiscal in addition  we had lower outside contractor costs in both the product development and consulting services areas  partially offset by higher bad debt expense see critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts 
financial condition  liquidity and capital structure during fiscal  we experienced declines in our financial condition  liquidity and capital structure  including the following cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments decreased by million to million primarily as a result of negative cash flows from operations of approximately million and a decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately million from the prior year 
the convertible debt to equity ratio increased from at february  to at february  primarily as a result of reported net losses in fiscal use of estimates and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software development costs  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill  income taxes  exit and disposal related expenses and stock option based compensation plans 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue our revenue consists of i fees from licenses of our software  ii fees from technical support and product updates  iii fees from professional services  including implementation  training and hosting and iv reimbursed expenses 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the requirements of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license  support and professional services revenue to be recognized each accounting period 
software license revenue is generally recognized using the residual method described below when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery occurs when media containing the licensed program is provided to a common carrier  typically fob shipping point or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the license fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is payable within twelve months of the agreement date  based upon our successful collection history on such arrangements 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is probable we perform a credit review for all significant transactions at the time the arrangement is executed to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer recognition of the revenue until collection 
if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  recognition of the software revenue is deferred until the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
typically  payments for software licenses are due within twelve months of the agreement date 
when software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the agreement date  software revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
under the residual method  we defer revenue for the fair value of any undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue when the basic criteria in sop and sab have been met 
our customer arrangements typically contain multiple elements that may include software  options for future purchases of software products not previously licensed to the customer  support  consulting  training  hosting and reimbursed expenses 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements using the residual method  based on vsoe 
each software license arrangement requires careful review to identify each individual element and to determine the proper amount of software revenue to be allocated among the various elements based on vsoe 
under the residual method  if an arrangement contains one or more undelivered elements  the vsoe of the undelivered elements are deferred and the revenue is recognized once the elements are delivered 
if vsoe for one or more of the undelivered elements in an arrangement does not exist  we recognize the entire arrangement fee over the period the undelivered elements are delivered 
in addition to evaluating the vsoe of fair value of each element of an arrangement  we also consider whether such elements can be separated into separate units of accounting in accordance with sop when making this determination  we consider the nature of services provided when purchased with a software license ie  consideration of whether services are essential to the functionality of software products licensed  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors and timing of payments  among other things 
when we provide services deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software products licensed or the licensed software requires significant production  modification or customization  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in these cases  software revenue is recognized based on labor hours or costs incurred to date compared to total estimated labor hours or costs for the contract 
implementation services are separately priced and sold  are generally available from a number of suppliers and typically are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
implementation services  which include project management  systems planning  design and implementation  customer configurations and training are billed on an hourly basis time and materials or under fixed price contracts 
implementation services are recognized as the work is performed 
on fixed price contracts  services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating labor hours or costs incurred to date to total estimated labor hours or costs 
in the event services are billed in advance of work being performed  the billed amount is initially recorded as deferred services revenue and recognized as services revenue when the work is performed 
when total cost estimates exceed revenue  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
vsoe of fair value for implementation services is based upon separate sales of services at stated hourly rates 
the process of estimation inherent in the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue is subject to judgments and uncertainties and may affect the amounts of software and services revenue under certain contracts and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates to complete client engagements  including skill level and experience of project managers  staff assigned to engagements and continuity and attrition level of implementation consulting staff 
changes in the estimated stage of completion of a particular project could create variability in our revenue and results of operations if we are required to increase or decrease previously recognized revenue related to a particular project or if we expect to incur a loss on the project 
support revenue includes post contract customer support and the rights to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements 
support services are separately priced and stated in our arrangements 
customer support is generally billed annually  initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as support revenue ratably over the support period 
vsoe of fair value for support services is typically provided by renewal rates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we initially record our provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers  among other factors  i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable eg  license  consulting  maintenance  etc  iv our historical provision for doubtful accounts  which has ranged between approximately and of total revenue over the three years ending february   v our historical write offs and recoveries  vi the credit worthiness of each customer  vii the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and viii general economic conditions 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
based on our total revenue reported for fiscal  our provision for doubtful accounts would change by approximately million annually for a change in proportion to total revenue 
the provision for doubtful accounts is included in sales and marketing expense for software license receivables and cost of services and support for services and support fees receivable  in the consolidated statement of operations 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize the development cost of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients 
software development costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  commencing with the date the product is first available for general release 
generally  an economic life of two years is used to amortize capitalized software development costs 
in future periods  if we determine that technological feasibility occurs at a later date  such as coincident with general product release to clients  we may not capitalize any software development costs 
this would increase our reported operating expenses in the short term by the amounts we do not capitalize 
the amounts of software development costs that we have capitalized have ranged between million and million per year during our last three fiscal years 
the estimated economic life of our capitalized software development costs is subject to change in future periods based on our experience with the length of time our products or enhancements are being or are expected to be used 
the amortization of software development costs have ranged between million and million per year during our last three fiscal years 
a change in the expected economic life of our capitalized software development costs of six months would change our annual operating expenses by approximately million if we increased the expected economic life by six months and by million if we decreased the expected economic life by six months 
valuation and impairment review of long lived assets we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development  if any  is recorded as an expense at the acquisition date 
the majority of the entities acquired by us do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
as required by sfas  in lieu of amortizing goodwill  we test goodwill for impairment periodically and record any necessary impairment in accordance with sfas we are amortizing our intangible assets as follows i acquired technology related intangible assets are currently being amortized over their estimated useful life using the straight line method and ii customer relationship related intangible assets are currently being amortized over their estimated useful life based on the greater of the straight line method or the estimated customer attrition rates 
we evaluate all of our long lived assets primarily property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
in accordance with sfas  when a long lived asset or intangible asset is abandoned  the carrying value is charged to expense in the period of abandonment 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  associated with certain furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements that we abandoned in connection with exit and disposal plans 
these assets were located in facilities that we ceased to use 
based on our evaluation of these assets we determined that the assets were not marketable for resale and oftentimes could not be removed from the premises eg  the asset consisted of a dividing wall or other permanent fixture 
in fiscal  million of the aforementioned million was related to the discontinued use of certain internal software used by our sales force that was replaced with another tool 
as of february  and february   our net book value of long lived assets  consisted of the following in thousands property and equipment software development costs software developed for internal use goodwill acquired technology customer relationships other total while we do not currently believe any of our long lived assets are impaired  and we do not anticipate an impairment in the near term  if a change in circumstances were to occur requiring an assessment of impairment  we would be required to evaluate whether the future cash flows related to the asset will be greater than its carrying value at the time of the impairment test 
while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our operations  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives 
if such an evaluation resulted in an impairment of any of our long lived assets  such impairment would be recorded in the period we make the impairment determination 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility below our carrying value 
please see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business 
during the six months ended august   the company experienced adverse changes in its stock price resulting from its poor financial performance 
as a result  we performed a test for goodwill impairment at august  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the company as of august  there was no impairment of goodwill 
we performed goodwill impairment reviews on february  and february   our annual dates for goodwill impairment review  and determined that the implied fair value of the company exceeded the carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment charge was recorded during fiscal or fiscal we performed goodwill impairment reviews during our second and third quarters of fiscal due to a decrease in market capitalization  and no impairment losses were recognized 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment as of february   our annual date for goodwill impairment review  and determined that our implied fair value was less than stockholders equity  including goodwill  an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
therefore  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to the estimated fair value as of that date 
the goodwill impairment loss was determined by calculating the difference between a our implied fair value as of february  less the fair value of our net assets and b the carrying value of goodwill 
the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets of the company were determined by an independent valuation 
our implied fair value was estimated based on the closing quoted market price of our common stock on february  multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares market capitalization plus an implied control premium as if we were owned by a single stockholder 
the implied control premium used for purposes of measuring the implied fair value of the company was determined by review of the premiums paid by other companies in past public technology and software acquisitions 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill involves judgments as to when an impairment may exist  as well as estimates used to compute the implied fair value 
if the estimates used to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill were to change such that the fair value dropped below stockholders equity  this could result in an impairment charge for some or all of our goodwill balance in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the valuation allowance we have recorded 
based on various factors  including our cumulative losses for the three year period ended february   the fiscal year loss  and estimates of future profitability  management recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  which resulted in a million charge to income tax expense in the fiscal year ended february  management performed a similar analysis as of february   and concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our net deferred tax assets as of february  therefore  we have maintained a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
management will continue to monitor its estimates of future profitability and the likelihood of realizing our net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
also  as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our full year income on a quarterly basis and the related income tax expense  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
additionally  we make judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction 
tax liabilities can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can impact our overall income tax expense 
this process involves estimating our current tax liabilities in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
exit and disposal activities during fiscal  and we initiated and completed a series of exit and disposal plans the exit plans 
we have accounted for the exit plans in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
restructuring and impairment charges and other applicable accounting standards as discussed below 
in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas superseded eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs associated with a restructuring eitf and eitf issue no 
costs associated with lease modification or termination eitf 
we adopted sfas effective january   therefore  exit and disposal charges subsequent to december  were accounted for in accordance with sfas the adoption of sfas did not impact our exit and disposal obligations recognized prior to january   as these obligations must continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf and eitf and other applicable pre existing guidance 
the expenses incurred in connection with the exit plans are composed primarily of i severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  ii lease termination costs and or costs associated with ceasing to use certain facilities and iii impairment costs related to certain long lived assets abandoned 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that i liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value  ii one time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee  unless the employee must provide future service  in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period  iii liabilities related to an operating lease contract be measured at fair value and recorded when the contract does not have any future economic benefit to the entity ie  the entity ceases to utilize the rights conveyed by the contract  and iv all other costs related to an exit or disposal activity be expensed as incurred 
for those employees with pre existing employment contracts which specified benefits upon termination  we accounted for severance and related benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits sfas as the amounts were both probable and estimable 
we accounted for costs related to the assets abandoned in connection with the exit plans in accordance with sfas and  accordingly  charged to expense the net carrying value of the long lived assets when we abandoned the assets  primarily leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
please refer to valuation and impairment review of long lived assets described above for a further discussion of our accounting policy and related accounting estimates involved related to assessing whether an asset is impaired 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the exit plans are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities 
in determining the charges related to the exit plans  we were required to make significant estimates related to the expenses associated with our excess facilities 
for example  in determining the charge for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income including both timing and amount of the potential sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities eg  maintenance  utilities  property management fees  etc  and potential brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
we based our estimates of sublease income  operating costs and brokerage commissions  in part  on the opinions of third party real estate advisors  current market conditions and rental rates  the status of negotiations with potential subtenants  and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
these estimates  along with other estimates made by management in connection with the exit plans may vary significantly depending  in part  upon factors that may be beyond our control 
specifically  these estimates will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
changing business and real estate market conditions may affect the assumptions related to the timing and extent of our ability to sublease vacated space 
we periodically review the status of exit and disposal liabilities and  if appropriate  we record changes to our exit and disposal liabilities based on management s most current estimates 
stock option based compensation plans we account for our stock option based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no

the weighted average estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights granted under our employee stock purchase plan was  and per share for fiscal  and  respectively 
we determined the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock options and stock purchase plan shares by estimating the expected useful lives  giving consideration to the vesting and purchase periods  contractual lives  actual employee forfeitures  and the relationship between the exercise price and the fair market value of our common stock  among other factors 
the risk free interest rate is the us treasury bill rate for the relevant expected life

revenue software revenue 
software revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal we believe the decreases in software revenue in fiscal were due to cautious capital spending for supply chain software purchases and to effects resulting from the magnitude of changes in our workforce  including our executive management and sales organization  difficulties in sales execution and a strong competitive environment 
we experienced lengthening sales cycles and reductions in the size of customer orders compared to the same period in fiscal these factors resulted in a decrease in the number of significant software license transactions with a value of  or greater  the number of transactions greater than million and our asp 
the modest decrease in software revenue in fiscal was due to a continued decline in the asp offset by an increase in the number of significant software transactions and increased software revenue from transactions accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
we attribute much of the caution of our clients and prospects to their concerns regarding the sustainability of the current economic recovery and the current geopolitical environment in which we operate 
we saw no driving force to overcome the negative market factors that are holding back companies from supply chain initiatives 
further  we believe the effort by companies to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of consumed the internal resources of our clients and prospects in fiscal and slowed the decision making process for other software purchases 
the following table summarizes significant software transactions consummated during fiscal  and fiscal year ended february or  significant software transactions number of transactions  to  number of transactions million or greater total number of transactions average selling price in thousands significant software transactions are those with a value of  or greater recognized within the fiscal year 
support revenue 
support revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal our percentage of annual support renewals by our clients remains high  however  decreases in support revenue from non renewals were not fully offset by increases in support revenue from new software sales during the year 
we have not lost any of our largest support customers in the past year that had a material negative effect on revenue 
the increase in support revenue in fiscal was due to the increase in the base of clients that have licensed our software products and entered into annual support arrangements  coupled with net renewals of annual support agreements by our existing client base 
there can be no assurance that our historical renewal rate will continue 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
services revenue 
services revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in services revenue in the past two fiscal years was the result of the decrease in the number of completed software license transactions in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  resulting in lower demand for implementation services and competitive rate pressures on consulting engagements 
additionally  we have experienced a decrease in the number of services employees from both voluntary and involuntary terminations 
services revenue tends to track software license revenue in prior periods 
there can be no assurance that the rates we charge for consulting and implementation services will improve  or even remain at current levels 
the market for information technology consulting services is highly competitive and we are affected by these market conditions 
accordingly  services revenue may continue to decline unless and until we experience a sustained increase in our software licenses and maintain adequate resource capacity and capabilities 
we also expect that services revenue will continue to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis  as revenue from the implementation of software is not generally recognized in the same period as the related license revenue 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
reimbursed expenses 
reimbursed expenses decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in reimbursed expenses is consistent with decreases in services revenue in these periods 
international revenue 
we market and sell our software and services internationally  primarily in europe  asia  canada  central america and south america 
revenue outside of the us decreased million  or  to million  in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million  or  to million  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue by geographic area is determined on the basis of the geographic area in which transactions are consummated 
revenue outside of the us as a percentage of total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the percentage of international revenue to total revenue remained consistent in fiscal  the decrease in our international revenue was the result of cautious capital spending for supply chain software purchases and the effects resulting from the magnitude of changes in our workforce  including our executive management and sales organization  difficulties in execution and a strong competitive environment 
the increase in international revenue in fiscal was due to improved sales execution in europe and growth in the emerging markets in the asia pacific region 
customer concentration 
no individual customer accounted for more than of annual revenue in the three years ended february  operating expenses cost of software 
cost of software consists primarily of amortization of capitalized software development costs and royalty fees associated with third party software either embedded in our software or resold by us 
the following table sets forth amortization of capitalized software development costs and other costs of software for the three fiscal years ended february or   and in thousands fiscal year ended february or  amortization of capitalized software percentage of software revenue other costs of software percentage of software revenue total cost of software percentage of software revenue the decrease in the total cost of software in fiscal as compared to fiscal was a result of decreased royalties paid to third parties as a result of a decrease in software revenue  partially offset by an increase in amortization of capitalized software due to the product release of version in february and the write off of one of our capitalized products for which the anticipated future gross revenue were less than the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the product 
the decrease in the total cost of software in fiscal as compared to fiscal was a result of decreased royalties paid to third parties as a result of a decrease in software revenue and changes in the mix of products licensed as well as a decrease in amortization of capitalized software due to product release becoming fully amortized in fiscal while product release was completed in february resulting in no incremental amortization in fiscal amortization of capitalized software development costs does not vary with software revenue while royalty fees do 
amortization of acquired technology 
in connection with acquisitions in fiscal  and  we acquired developed technology that we offer as part of our integrated solutions 
acquired technology is amortized over periods ranging from four to six years 
we expect annual amortization of acquired technology to be approximately million in fiscal cost of services and support 
cost of services and support primarily includes personnel and third party contractor costs 
cost of services and support  excluding the cost of reimbursed expenses and non cash stock option compensation expense  as a percentage of related revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal cost of services and support decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in cost of services and support was attributable to an overall decrease in the average number of services and support employees to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this was a result of the implementation of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives during fiscal and fiscal  as well as from voluntary attrition 
the decrease in cost of services and support as a percentage of related revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects a slight increase in the proportion of this revenue derived from support services  which historically have higher margins than implementation services 
the decrease in cost of services and support during fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to a decrease in the average number of services and support employees to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this was a result of the implementation of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives during fiscal and fiscal and voluntary attrition 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  promotional events such as user conferences  trade shows and technical conferences  advertising and public relations programs 
sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal and fiscal was due to an overall decrease in the average number of sales  marketing and business development employees to for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal  which was primarily a result of the implementation of our exit and disposal plans in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  a decrease in promotional spending  travel  advertising and public relations spending resulting from cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  and a decrease in sales commissions due to lower software revenue 
offset by an increase in bad debt expense in fiscal product development 
product development costs include expenses associated with the development of new software products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities and are reported net of capitalized software development costs 
such costs are primarily from employees and third party contractors 
the following table sets forth product development costs for the three fiscal years ended february or   and in thousands fiscal year ended february or  gross product development costs percentage of total revenue less capitalized software development costs percentage of total revenue product development costs  as reported percentage of total revenue gross product development costs decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal and was due to further consolidation of our us product development function to our corporate headquarters in rockville  maryland  an overall decrease in the average number of product development employees to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this was primarily a result of the implementation of our exit and disposal plans in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  an increase in the proportion of our development work being performed by contractors in india in order to take advantage of cost efficiencies associated with india s lower wage scale  a decrease in the average number of product development contractors in the us in fiscal and fiscal  and lower personnel costs in fiscal as we migrated some of our product development efforts to our new product development center in hyderabad  india 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our legal  finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and information systems functions 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a decrease in the average number of general and administrative employees resulting from the implementation of our exit and disposal plans in fiscal and fiscal  in addition to a decrease in property tax expense related to a settlement with the state of maryland 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in accounting professional fees primarily related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a decrease in the average number of general and administrative employees resulting from the implementation of our exit and disposal plans in fiscal and fiscal amortization of intangibles 
our past acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from four to seven years 
amortization of intangibles increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in amortization of intangibles in fiscal and was due to a change in the talus customer relationships amortization from seven years to five years in late fiscal in fiscal  the increase in amortization of intangibles was partially offset by the completion of amortization in fiscal of acquired technology related to the stg and talus acquisitions 
goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility below our carrying value 
please see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business 
during the six months ended august   the company experienced adverse changes in its stock price resulting from its poor financial performance 
as a result  the company performed a test for goodwill impairment at august  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the company as of august   there was no impairment of goodwill 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment reviews on february  and february  and determined that the implied fair value of the company exceeded the carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment charge was recorded during fiscal details of our amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment are included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and details of our acquisitions are included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
during fiscal we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to the estimated fair value as of that date 
see further discussion in valuation and impairment review of long lived assets 
purchased research and development 
our acquisition of wds in fiscal included the purchase of technology that had not yet been determined to be technologically feasible and had no alternative future use at its then current stage of development 
accordingly  in fiscal the portion of the purchase price for wds allocated to purchased research and development of million  in aggregate  was expensed immediately in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
details of our acquisitions are included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
exit and disposal activities 
in order to adjust our cost structure and resource allocation to increase efficiencies and reduce excess office space  we adopted exit and disposal plans in the second quarter of fiscal  the first and fourth quarters of fiscal and in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal in connection with our decision to implement these plans  we incurred related exit and disposal charges of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the following table sets forth a summary of exit and disposal activity charges  net of adjustments  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in thousands fiscal year ended february or  lease obligations and terminations severance and related benefits impairment charges other total exit and disposal activities the impact to reported basic and diluted loss per share as a result of the exit and disposal charges was   and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in response to the difficulties we faced in our ability to stabilize revenue and operating performance  we enacted a number of cost containment and cost reduction measures over the past four fiscal years to better align our cost structure with expected revenue 
specifically  we took the following actions we reduced our workforce by  and employees through involuntary terminations with the fiscal  and exit and disposal plans  respectively 
we further consolidated our product development function in the us to the corporate headquarters in rockville  maryland as part of the exit and disposal plans in fiscal and fiscal this included the relocation of certain employees from wayne  pennsylvania  san carlos  california  atlanta  georgia  denver  colorado and ottawa  canada to rockville  maryland 
as a result of the workforce reductions  product development consolidation and employee attrition  certain of our facilities were under utilized 
accordingly  we consolidated our remaining workforce in the under utilized facilities and abandoned the then vacated office space 
the facilities permanently removed from our operations during fiscal   and were located in wayne  pennsylvania  irving  texas  detroit  michigan  denver  colorado  ottawa  canada  itasca  illinois  milan  italy  munich and ratingen  germany and stockholm  sweden and the philippines 
a portion of the office space was permanently vacated in certain facilities located in rockville  maryland  atlanta  georgia  calabasas and san carlos  california  bracknell  united kingdom and tokyo  japan 
as part of the consolidation of our facilities  certain leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures were abandoned 
as a result  we recorded non cash charges equal to the net book value of these abandoned assets in exit and disposal activity charges 
as a result of our exit and disposal activities and cost containment initiatives during the past four fiscal years  we have reduced all other operating expenses as shown in the table under key financial metrics fiscal by million to million for the fiscal year ended february  details of our exit and disposal charges are included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
substantially all of the cost savings from our exit and disposal activities and cost containment initiatives implemented in fiscal were reflected in our operating results by the first quarter of fiscal as of february   we had achieved quarterly cost savings of approximately million  compared to the first quarter of fiscal as a result of implementing our exit and disposal plans during fiscal we have completed most of the planned initiatives approved in our second quarter fiscal exit and disposal plans and will complete the remainder of the initiatives in fiscal the total exit and disposal charges reflected in the financial statements are based on management s current estimates  which may change materially if actual lease related expenditures or sublease income differ from current estimates 
see forward looking statements 
non cash stock option compensation expense 
we recognized non cash stock option compensation expense of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  related to unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition of talus 
as part of the talus acquisition  we assumed all outstanding talus stock options  which were converted into our stock options 
options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were unvested at the acquisition date 
fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation requires the acquiring company to measure the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed at the acquisition date in a purchase business combination and record a compensation charge over the remaining vesting period of those options to the extent those options remain outstanding 
the unamortized value of these stock awards is included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
all of these outstanding options are fully vested and all compensation expense has been recognized as of february  repriced options 
in january  the company repriced certain employee stock options  other than those held by executive officers or directors 
this resulted in approximately million options being repriced and the four year vesting period starting over 
under fin  repriced options are subject to variable plan accounting  which requires compensation cost or benefit to be recorded each period based on changes in our stock price until the repriced options are exercised  forfeited or expire 
the initial fair value used to measure the ongoing stock option compensation charge or benefit was based on the closing price of our common stock on june  since our stock price at the beginning and end of fiscal  and was below  no charge or benefit was recorded during fiscal  and as of february   approximately  repriced options were still outstanding  all of which are fully vested 
in future periods  we will record additional charges or benefits related to the repriced stock options still outstanding based on the change in our common stock price compared to the last reporting period 
if our stock price at the beginning and end of any reporting period is less than  no charge or benefit will be recorded 
other expense  net other expense  net  includes interest income from cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  interest expense from borrowings and payments on our capital lease obligations  foreign currency exchange gains or losses and other gains or losses 
other expense  net  decreased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in other expense  net in fiscal compared to fiscal relates to a decrease in interest expense of approximately million primarily related to a reduction in interest expense on our outstanding convertible notes due to the conversion of million of our notes during fiscal see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  an increase in interest income of million in fiscal and a decrease of other expense of million and a foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal compared to a million foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal the increase in other expense  net in fiscal as compared to fiscal relates to a reduction in interest income of million and million foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal  compared to a million exchange gain in fiscal debt conversion expense during fiscal  the company exchanged million of its notes for  shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions with note holders 
the offer and issuance of the common stock underlying these transactions were exempt from registration under section a of the securities act of and were freely traded upon issuance 
at the conversion price of per share  the million of notes exchanged would have been convertible into  shares of common stock 
for accounting purposes  the additional  shares of common stock that the company issued in these transactions are considered an inducement for the holders to convert their notes  which required the company to record a non operating expense equal to the fair value of the additional shares issued to the holders 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash debt conversion expense of approximately million during the year ended february  these transactions resulted in a million reduction of the notes outstanding and increased stockholders equity by million 
the  shares of common stock issued in these transactions represented approximately of the shares outstanding as of february  provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  million  million and million of the income tax provision relates to foreign taxes  respectively 
during fiscal  management concluded that  based on various factors  including our cumulative losses for fiscal  and  the size of our loss for fiscal and estimates of future profitability  future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to cover our net deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of positive and negative evidence regarding recoverability of our net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  which resulted in a million charge to income tax expense in fiscal management will continue to monitor its estimates of future profitability and realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
in fiscal and fiscal  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because we have concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our net deferred tax assets as of february  and february   respectively 
loss per common share loss per common share is computed in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  which requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for entities with complex capital structures 
basic loss per common share is based on net loss divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings or loss per common share includes  when dilutive  i the effect of stock options  warrants and restricted stock granted using the treasury stock method  ii the effect of contingently issuable shares earned during the period  and iii shares issuable under the conversion feature of our notes using the if converted method 
future weighted average shares outstanding calculations will be impacted by the following factors the ongoing issuance of common stock associated with stock option and warrant exercises  the issuance of common shares associated with our employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants  any fluctuations in our stock price  which could cause changes in the number of common stock equivalents included in the diluted earnings per common share calculations to the extent we have positive net income  the issuance of common stock to raise capital or effect business combinations should we enter into such transactions  and assumed or actual conversions of our convertible debt into common stock 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements through cash flows provided from operations  long term borrowings including the sale of convertible notes and sales of equity securities 
the significant components of our working capital are liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued expenses  short term restructuring obligations and deferred revenue 
in fiscal  working capital decreased million  to million  as of february   primarily as a result of cash used in operating activities directly attributed to decreased revenue during fiscal and investing activities 
cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments decreased million during fiscal  to million  as of february  the decrease is due to changes in working capital items  including million in payments for exit and disposal obligations  as well as million in expenditures on property  equipment and software  including million of capitalized software  and million in principal payments on long term debt and capital leases 
offset by million in cash proceeds from the disposal of our right to certain fractional shares of a jet  and million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
although we were a net user of cash in fiscal  we believe that the combination of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund expected capital expenditures  capital lease obligations and working capital needs for the next twelve months 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may elect to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we are able to raise it on terms acceptable to us 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results

upon a change of control of the company  the holders of the notes would have the right to require us or our successor to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase in cash 
the notes do not have any financial covenants 
since november   we have had the right to redeem  from time to time  the notes in whole or in part  at our option 
redemption can be made on at least days notice if the trading price of our common stock for trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the day prior to the mailing of notice of redemption exceeds of the conversion price of the notes 
the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of the principal amount  is redemption period redemption price november  through october  november  through october  november  through maturity we may choose to purchase a portion of the notes in the open market from time to time with cash or enter into alternative transactions to reduce the balance of the notes  such as exchanging notes for shares of our common stock  if we are able to do so on terms favorable to us 
purchases of the notes with cash would reduce our debt outstanding and may result in a decrease to our liquidity and working capital

the financial covenants for the supplemental equipment advances are the same as the financial covenants for the new credit facility 
we had an additional credit agreement the equipment line with svb  as amended  which expired march   under which we were permitted to borrow up to million for the purchase of equipment 
amounts borrowed under the equipment line accrue interest at a rate equal to the greater of the three year treasury note rate plus  or  and are repaid monthly over a month period 
during fiscal  we borrowed million under the equipment line 
the principal balance remaining as of february  was approximately million 
the financial covenants for the equipment line are the same as the financial covenants for the credit facility 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of february  cash flows cash used in provided by operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in operating cash flows of million in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from a decrease in contribution of accounts receivable due to lower revenue  increased payments related to exit and disposal activities  increased payments made to vendors related to the timing of receiving vendor invoices  partially offset by a decrease in the payment of interest on our convertible debt as a result of the decrease in our outstanding debt balance and a lower net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal the improvement in operating cash flows of million in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from a decreased operating loss in fiscal compared to fiscal cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
investing activities consist of the sales and purchases of marketable securities and long term investments  changes in restricted cash  purchases and sales of property and equipment  purchases and capitalization of software and acquisitions of businesses 
total purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal total purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to fiscal due to the completion of the build out of our new corporate headquarters space during fiscal in fiscal  approximately million was provided by the elimination of cash restrictions upon the transfer of our letters of credit from bank of america to svb 
approximately million of this million was recorded as a deposit to secure an international lease 
acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired  of million and million during the fiscal and relates to approximately million which was provided by proceeds held in escrow from prior acquisitions fiscal and the wds and dfe acquisitions fiscal  respectively 
sales of marketable securities  net of purchases  were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales of long term investments  net of purchases  were million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash used in provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used in provided by financing activities consisted of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases  cash proceeds from borrowings on our line of credit and cash payments for principal amounts on our svb equipment line of credit and capital lease obligations 
in the future  we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in addition  we may make strategic investments in businesses and enter into joint ventures that complement our existing business 
any future acquisition or investment may result in a decrease to our liquidity and working capital to the extent we pay with cash 
we have experienced substantial negative cash flows during the three years ended february   primarily due to large declines in our revenue and our inability to reduce our expenses to a level at or below the levels of our revenue 
although we recently initiated additional exit and disposal activities focused on  among other things  further reducing our cost structure  a failure to rationalize expenses  stabilize or grow revenue and achieve positive cash flows will eventually impair our ability to support our operations and adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash position may continue to decline  primarily due to cash outflows associated with our exit and disposal activities  our operations and our debt service obligations 
we are obligated to pay approximately million of interest annually on our million of notes 
additionally  the notes will mature and become due and payable in november although we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investment balances will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months  there can be no assurance that in the longer term we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining an adequate level of cash resources 
we may be forced to act more aggressively in the future in the area of expense reduction in order to conserve cash as we look for alternative liquidity solutions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
lease arrangements 
we have entered into operating leases with unrelated third parties for our us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are oftentimes referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of february  are detailed previously in liquidity and capital resources 
we have a two year unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with svb for million which will expire on march   unless renewed 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may request cash advances  letters of credit  or both 
as of february   million in letters of credit was outstanding under the credit facility to secure our lease obligations for certain office space 
indemnification obligations 
we license software to our customers under contracts which we refer to as software license agreements slas 
each sla contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer  and generally includes provisions for indemnifying the customer against damages  judgments  reasonable cost and expenses incurred by the customer for any claim or suit based on infringement of a trademark or copyright as a result of the customer s use of our software 
the sla generally limits our indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no material claims are outstanding as of february  we account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we have not recorded any liabilities for indemnification obligations as of february  for several reasons  including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the slas  we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments  if any  related to such indemnification provisions 
there can be no assurance that potential future payments will not have a material adverse effect on our operating performance  financial condition and cash flows 
the sla generally provides that in the event of a determination that our software  or the customer s use of our software  infringes any trademark or copyright of any third party  or if we reasonably believe that such is the case  we  at our option and expense  have the right to obtain for the customer the right to continue using the infringing item  replace the infringing item or modify the infringing item so that it is no longer infringing 
warranty obligations 
we warrant to our customers in the sla that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products 
if necessary  we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
however  we have not incurred significant recurring expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these warranties is nominal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of february  recently issued accounting pronouncements sfas no 
revision  share based payment sfas r was issued in december and was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after june  the new statement requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the company currently accounts for its share based payments to employees under the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issues to employees 
additionally  the company complies with the stock based employer compensation disclosure requirements of sfas on april   the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas r 
the new rule allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of their next reporting period beginning after june  the company plans to adopt the new statement beginning in the first quarter of fiscal management believes the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
management is currently in the process of estimating the value the impact of the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp related to the american jobs creation act ajca 
fsp no 
application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities 
fsp requires companies that qualify for a deduction for domestic production activities under the ajca to account for the deduction as a special deduction under sfas no 
and reduce their tax expense in the period or periods the amounts are deductible on the tax return 
fsp no 
accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp allows companies additional time to evaluate whether foreign earnings will be repatriated under the repatriation provisions of the ajca and requires specified disclosures for companies needing the additional time to complete the evaluations 
once a decision is made to repatriate the foreign earnings  companies must reflect the deferred tax liabilities attributable to foreign earnings in the period that the decision is made to remit those earnings 
management does not believe the adoption of fsp and fsp will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment loses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued staff position eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired 
management does not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our indebtedness and financial condition our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in november  we completed a convertible debt offering of million in notes that are due november during fiscal  the balance of the notes was reduced to million as a result of million of notes being exchanged for shares of our common stock 
our indebtedness could have important consequences for investors 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of capital to fund our operations  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
while the terms of our credit facility impose certain limits on our ability to incur additional debt  we are permitted to incur additional debt subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the credit facility 
the terms of the notes set forth no limits on our ability to incur additional debt 
if a significant amount of new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we may have insufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
we will be required to generate sufficient cash to pay all amounts due on the notes and to conduct our business operations 
the notes require interest payments of million annually with million of principal due november as of february   the remaining principal and interest payments due under the notes were million 
our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments totaled million as of february  assuming our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments remain constant from our february  levels  we will have to generate a minimum of million of net cash flow through any combination of normal operations of our company  raising of debt and equity capital or asset sales by november to meet our remaining principal and interest payments under the notes 
we have incurred net losses in the past  and we may not be able to cover our anticipated debt service obligations 
this may materially hinder our ability to make principal and interest payments on the notes 
concerns about our ability to meet our debt service obligations could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we may choose to exchange the notes for shares of our common stock in the open market or purchase a portion of the notes for cash  which could materially dilute existing stockholders or could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
during fiscal  we issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for the notes in privately negotiated transactions under section a of the securities act of  and we may enter into such transactions from time to time if we are able to do so on terms that are favorable to us 
if we choose to enter into privately negotiated transactions to exchange some of our outstanding notes for shares of our common stock  it could materially dilute the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders and result in non cash charges to earnings 
in addition  to the extent we are able to do so on terms favorable to us  we may choose to purchase a portion of the notes outstanding from time to time in the open market with cash 
while the terms of our credit facility impose certain limits on our ability to repurchase our debt securities with cash  we are permitted to do so subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the credit facility 
if purchases of the notes in the open market were funded from available cash and cash equivalents  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
we may violate financial covenants under our credit facility which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
we have an unsecured credit facility with svb with borrowing capacity of million 
under the terms of the credit facility  which expires on march   we are also able to borrow up to an additional million for the purchase of equipment or other capital expenditures through december  as of february   approximately million of letters of credit were outstanding with svb  and approximately million was outstanding under a previous equipment financing credit line 
the terms of the credit facility require us to comply with the following financial covenants i minimum tangible net worth defined as stockholders equity plus convertible debt less goodwill  capitalized software costs and other intangible assets must be at least million plus of consolidated net income generated cumulatively commencing with the first quarter of fiscal and ii our ratio of a unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments deposited with svb and its affiliates plus net accounts receivable to b current liabilities plus long term indebtedness to svb and outstanding letters of credit minus deferred revenue  must be at least to the credit facility requires us to maintain million in funds with svb asset management and its affiliates 
if our future financial performance results in a violation of these financial covenants under our credit facility  or with our previous equipment financing credit line  we could be required to provide cash collateral for letters of credit or repay outstanding borrowings  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
risks related to our business adverse economic and political conditions caused a deterioration of demand in the markets for our products and services and have adversely affected and could further adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition 
our revenue and operating results depend on the overall demand for our enterprise application software and related services 
regional and global adverse changes in the economy and political upheaval and unrest caused a deterioration of the markets for our products and services in recent years 
recent improvements in economic conditions have not yet resulted in improvements in the markets for supply chain management software 
these factors resulted in reductions  delays and postponements of customer purchases  which materially and adversely affected our financial performance during the last four fiscal years 
demand for our solutions designed to optimize pricing and revenue management  a component of our demand management solutions  was more severely affected than our other solutions for which there are more mature markets 
if these adverse conditions continue or worsen  we would likely experience further reductions  delays  and postponements of customer purchases further adversely affecting our operating performance and financial condition 
national and global responses to future hostilities and terrorist attacks may materially and adversely affect demand for our software and services because of the economic and political effects on our markets and by interrupting the ability of our customers to do business in the ordinary course  as a result of a variety of factors  including  among others  changes or disruptions in movement and sourcing of materials  goods and components or possible interruptions in the flow of information or monies 
we believe our recent financial performance was adversely affected by difficulties in execution and a market focus that was too broad for existing market conditions and a strong competitive environment 
if we cannot overcome these difficulties our operating performance and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we incurred significant losses during the past four fiscal years 
we believe our recent financial performance was adversely affected by difficulties in execution and a market focus that was too broad for existing market conditions and a strong competitive environment 
we experienced sequential declines in software and total revenue during our second and third quarters of fiscal total annual revenue decreased in each of fiscal and fiscal  as compared to prior fiscal years 
for the fiscal year ended  there were declines in software and total revenue in comparison to the fiscal year ended the losses incurred during these periods were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal if we do not successfully align our cost structure with our revenue without hindering our ability to grow revenue  or if we do not successfully overcome the recent internal factors that have hindered our performance  our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed  and we could continue to incur significant losses 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of significant declines in our stock price during fiscal if our stock price decreases to levels such that the implied fair value of our company is significantly less than stockholders equity for a sustained period of time  we may be required to record additional significant non cash charges associated with goodwill impairment 
on march   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only method 
as required by sfas  we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our implied fair value below our carrying value 
during fiscal  we experienced adverse changes in our stock price resulting from a decline in our financial performance caused by adverse business conditions that affected the technology industry  especially enterprise application software companies 
as a result of these tests  we determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  our market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of our company as of february   there was an impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the impairment of goodwill as of february   we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
we performed our fiscal goodwill impairment review on february   our annual date for goodwill impairment review  and determined that the implied fair value of the company exceeded its carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment charge was recorded for fiscal we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value 
if our stock price is significantly lower than recent levels such that the implied fair value of our company is significantly less than stockholders equity for a sustained period of time  among other factors  we may be required to record an additional impairment loss related to goodwill below its carrying amount 
our future results will be adversely affected by several types of significant non cash charges which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we will incur significant non cash charges in the future related to the amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets from past acquisitions 
during fiscal  we announced that we were required to write off our investment in converge  inc  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
during fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets which resulted in a million non cash charge to income tax expense 
also during fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
during fiscal   and  we recorded net write downs of long lived assets associated with exit and disposal activities of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  consisting of the abandonment or disposal of certain furniture  fixtures  computer equipment  leasehold improvements related to vacating office space and other long lived assets 
during fiscal  we exchanged million of the notes for million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions  which resulted in a non cash debt conversion expense of million 
we may also incur non cash charges in future periods related to impairments of long lived assets and future exchanges of notes for shares of our common stock  if any 
to achieve profitability  we must grow our revenue sufficiently to cover these charges 
our failure to achieve profitability could cause our stock price to decline 
if our exit and disposal plans and our cost containment and cost reduction measures fail to achieve the desired results or result in unanticipated negative consequences  we may suffer material harm to our operating performance and financial condition 
in response to deteriorations in our markets  during fiscal   and  we implemented exit and disposal plans and cost containment and cost reduction measures and are continuing to implement cost containment and cost reduction measures to align our cost structure with our revenue 
these actions have included  among other things  reductions in workforce and consolidations of our operational facilities 
headcount at the end of fiscal was compared to at the end of fiscal we also abandoned additional idle space in our rockville  maryland  tokyo  japan  san carlos and calabasas  california and bracknell  united kingdom facilities and closed two offices in europe and one in the philippines during fiscal as part of the consolidation of our facilities  we negotiate lease termination agreements or subleases for certain of our facilities 
we cannot predict when or if we will be successful in negotiating lease termination agreements or subleases on terms acceptable to us 
should we be unsuccessful in such negotiations or if the negotiated terms are less favorable than currently anticipated  we may be required to materially increase our exit and disposal related expenses in future periods 
further  if we consolidate additional facilities in the future  we may incur additional exit and disposal related expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we also cannot assure you that we will not reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce again in the future or that related transition issues associated with such a reduction will not occur again 
in fiscal   and  we recorded exit and disposal charges of million  million  million and million  respectively 
if we fail to achieve the desired results of our exit and disposal plans and our cost containment and cost reduction measures  we may suffer material harm to our operating performance and financial condition 
we reduced our workforce as part of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives 
if we fail to attract and retain a qualified workforce  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
further  our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives may hinder or impair our ability to take advantage of improvements in market conditions 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to motivate and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  marketing and services personnel 
competition for skilled personnel can be intense  and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining the personnel we need to improve our financial performance and grow 
as part of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives  we have recently reduced our workforce 
during the fiscal year ended february   voluntary employee attrition increased compared to recent periods 
in addition  the recent trading levels of our stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees under our stock option plans 
we consider stock options to be critically important in attracting and retaining employees 
as a result of these factors  our employees  whether or not affected by our reduction in workforce  may seek employment elsewhere 
continuity of personnel is a very important factor in our success 
moreover  the cost of hiring  training and retaining skilled employees is high  and we may have difficulty attracting such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions 
our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives may yield further unintended consequences  such as reduced employee morale  decreased productivity and disclosures of confidential information about us by employees that seek employment with others in violation of their confidentiality agreements with us 
failure to attract  motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
further  our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives may hinder or impair our ability to take advantage of improvements in market conditions 
we have experienced significant changes in senior management recently 
the success and growth of our business may suffer if we experience too many changes in key personnel in too short a period of time 
we have recently undergone significant changes in our senior management 
as a result  our senior management team has only recently begun to work together 
in july  gregory j 
owens resigned as our chief executive officer and was replaced by joseph l 
cowan as chief executive officer 
in april  mr 
owens resigned as chairman of the board 
in august of  our president  jeremy p 
coote resigned and the position of president was eliminated 
in addition  two other senior management personnel left the company during our third quarter of fiscal and one  whose position was eliminated  left the company at the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal in september  jeffrey l 
kissling was hired as our chief technology officer  and two other senior management personnel were promoted to new positions 
in march  we reorganized our sales and marketing organization under four primary business units which resulted in further management changes within the organizational structure 
our success depends significantly on the continued service of our executive officers and their ability to work together effectively as a management team 
we do not have fixed term employment agreements with any executive officers  other than with joseph l 
cowan  who has a two year employment agreement with our company that commenced in july   and we do not maintain key person life insurance on our executive officers 
the loss of services of any of our senior management for any reason or their inability to manage our company effectively could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we have restructured  and may in the future restructure  our sales force  which can be disruptive 
we have also reduced our sales force as part of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives 
our failure to field an effective sales organization could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we continue to rely heavily on our direct sales force 
in recent years  we reorganized our sales force in response to management changes and other internal considerations  most recently in march in fiscal  and  we reduced our sales force as a result of the deterioration in our markets and restructuring of our operations 
decreasing software revenue has resulted in reduced compensation earned by members of our sales force  it also has resulted  and may continue to result  in voluntary attrition of our sales force over time 
in order to stabilize and then grow our revenue  we will have to field an effective sales force 
changes in the structure of the sales force and sales force management have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to field a more productive sales force or successfully attract and retain qualified sales people at levels sufficient to support growth 
we cannot assure you that we will not continue to restructure our sales force or that the transition issues associated with restructuring the sales force will not recur 
such restructuring or associated transition issues can be disruptive and adversely impact our operating performance and financial condition 
sales cycles for our products and services can be long and unpredictable 
variations in the time it takes us to license our software may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
each client s decision to license and implement our products and services is discretionary  involves a significant commitment of resources and is subject to the client s budget cycles 
the time it takes to license our software to prospective clients varies substantially  but historically has ranged between three and twelve months 
prior sales and implementation cycles should not be relied upon as any indication of future cycles 
as a result of current economic conditions and increased competition  our sales cycle has recently become longer than historical sales cycles 
variations in the length of our sales cycles will cause our revenue to fluctuate widely from period to period 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and we typically recognize a substantial portion of our software revenue in the last month of a quarter  any delay in the licensing of our products could cause significant variations in our revenue from quarter to quarter 
these delays have occurred on a number of occasions in the past and have materially and adversely affected our financial performance  most recently in the fiscal year ended february  the length of our sales cycle depends on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following the complexities of client challenges our solutions address  the breadth of the solution required by the client  including the technical  organizational and geographic scope of the license  the size  timing and complexity of contractual terms of licenses and sales of our products and services  wide variations in contractual terms  which may defer recognition of revenue  customer financial constraints and credit worthiness  the evaluation and approval processes employed by the clients and prospects  which has become more complex and lengthy  economic  political and market conditions  and any other delays arising from factors beyond our control 
as a result of these and other factors  revenue for any quarter is subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
our future quarterly operating results from time to time may not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which would likely have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
an increase in sales of software products that require customization would result in revenue being recognized over the term of the contract for those products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recognize software license revenue upon delivery of our solutions and contract execution 
recently  more of our clients and prospects have been asking for unique capabilities in addition to our core capabilities to give them a competitive edge in the market place 
these instances could cause us to recognize more of our software license revenue on a contract accounting basis over the course of the delivery of the solution rather than upon delivery and contract execution 
the period between initial contact and the completion of the implementation of our products can be lengthy and is subject to a number of factors over many of which we have little or no control that may cause significant delays 
these factors include the size and complexity of the overall project 
as a result  a shift toward a higher proportion of software license contracts requiring contract accounting would have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
failure to maintain our margins and service rates for implementation services could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from implementation services 
if we fail to scope our implementation projects correctly  our service margins may suffer 
implementation services are predominately billed on an hourly or daily basis time and materials and sometimes under fixed price contracts 
implementation services billed on an hourly or daily basis are generally recognized as work is performed 
if we are not able to maintain the current service rates for our time and materials implementation services  without corresponding cost reductions  or if the percentage of fixed price contracts increases and we underestimate the costs of our fixed price contracts  our operating performance may suffer 
the rates we charge for our implementation services depend on a number of factors  including the following perceptions of our ability to add value through our implementation services  complexity of services performed  competition  pricing policies of our competitors and systems integrators  the use of globally sourced  lower cost service delivery capabilities within our industry  and economic  political and market conditions 
changes in the size or number of our software transactions may cause material fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the size and number of our software license transactions fluctuate 
fluctuations in the size and number of our software transactions have occurred  and may in the future occur  as a result of changes in demand for our software and services 
losses of  or delays in concluding  larger software transactions which typically are more complex  take longer to negotiate and are more subject to delays have had and could have a proportionately greater effect on our revenue and financial performance for a particular period 
we have experienced declines in the number of software transactions of million or greater since fiscal specifically  we recorded such software transactions in fiscal  such software transactions in fiscal  such software transactions in fiscal and such software transactions in fiscal  as a result of these changes in the size and number of our software transactions  our quarterly revenue and financial performance have fluctuated significantly and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
we experienced declines in software revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal lower software license revenue has resulted and may continue to result in reduced services and support revenue 
our ability to maintain or increase services and support revenue depends on our ability to maintain or increase the amount of software we license to customers 
during fiscal  and  we experienced declines in services revenue primarily as a result of declining software revenue in prior periods 
additional decreases of software license revenue or slowdowns in licensing may have a material adverse effect on our services and support revenue in future periods 
further declines in software revenue  a reduction in the renewal rate of annual support contracts  or both  could result in a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
in our third quarter of fiscal  second and fourth quarters of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  we experienced sequential quarterly declines in support revenue resulting from both the recent decline in software revenue and clients not renewing or partially renewing existing support contracts 
our support revenue includes post contract support and the rights to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements 
support contracts are generally renewable annually at the option of our customers 
we have experienced high rates of renewed annual support contracts from our customers 
if our software revenue does not grow and if our customers fail to renew or to fully renew their support contracts at historical rates  our support revenue could materially decline 
our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq  have recently issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to recent laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditor s audit of that assessment have required  and continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
moreover  because these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
during our recent audit  we recognized one material weakness regarding the accounting treatment for one large transaction involving complex judgment 
although the accounting error was detected and corrected prior to the release of our financial results for the period  if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could cause our stock price to decline 
effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our system of internal control over financial reporting that need improvement 
for example  during the recent audit of our system of internal control over financial reporting  we recognized one material weakness regarding the accounting treatment for one large transaction involving complex judgment as to whether services in the transaction were essential to the functionality of the software sold 
the accounting error was detected and corrected prior to the release of our financial results for the period 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure of our system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
inadequate internal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our markets are very competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for our solutions are very competitive 
the intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased in part as a result of the deterioration in our markets 
we expect this intensity of competition to increase in the future 
in addition  many leading companies in the business of providing enterprise application software have been the subject of mergers and acquisitions during the last several years 
we expect this trend towards consolidation to continue 
this industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole source vendors for customers 
if there is significant consolidation among enterprise application software companies  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
some competitors are offering software that competes with ours at little or no charge as components of bundled products or on a stand alone basis 
smaller niche software companies have been and will likely continue to develop unique offerings that compete effectively with some of our solutions 
further  our current or prospective clients and partners may become competitors in the future 
increased competition has resulted and in the future could result in price reductions  lower gross margins  longer sales cycles and the loss of market share 
each of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and therefore  we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them 
we directly compete with other enterprise application software vendors including aspen technology  demandtec  global logistics technologies  i technologies  jda software  logility  manhattan associates  profit logic  pros revenue management  rapt  retek acquired by oracle  sabre  sap and teradata a division of ncr 
certain enterprise resource planning erp vendors  in addition to sap  all of which are substantially larger than manugistics  have acquired or developed demand driven and supply chain management software companies  products  or functionality or have announced intentions to develop and sell demand and supply chain management solutions 
such vendors include oracle  which recently acquired peoplesoft and retek and ssa global technologies 
some of our current and potential competitors  particularly the erp vendors  have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and larger installed bases of clients 
three of our competitors  oracle and peoplesoft and retek  have combined and other of our current and potential competitors may combine pursuant to recently announced mergers or tender offers and subsequently utilize enhanced financial and human resources to develop and sell more competitive demand driven supply chain products 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
if the development of our products and services fails to keep pace with our industry s rapidly evolving technology  our future results may be materially and adversely affected 
the markets for our solutions are subject to rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
if we fail to keep pace with these changes  our products and services may be rendered less competitive or obsolete 
our product development and testing efforts have required  and are expected to continue to require  substantial investments 
we may not possess sufficient resources in the future to continue to make further necessary investments in technology 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced software in a timely manner  we may lose existing clients and fail to attract new clients  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
our continued shift of our product development operations to india poses significant risks 
we recently opened our own product development facility in india  and plan to move a substantial portion of our product development to india 
in addition  we maintain relationships with third parties in india to which we outsource a significant portion of our product development effort 
we are increasing the proportion of our product development work being performed at our facility in india in order to increase product development resources and to take advantage of cost efficiencies associated with india s lower wage scale 
we may not achieve the cost savings and other benefits we anticipate from this program 
we may not be able to find sufficient numbers of developers with the necessary skill sets in india to meet our needs 
we also have a heightened risk exposure to changes in the economic  security and political conditions of india 
economic and political instability  military actions and other unforeseen occurrences in india could impair our ability to develop and introduce new software applications and functionality in a timely manner  which could put our products at a competitive disadvantage whereby we lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers 
defects in our software  the improper scoping of a project  or problems in the implementation of our software could lead to claims for damages by our clients  loss of revenue or delays in the market acceptance of our solutions 
our software is complex and must be implemented to perform within the often sophisticated and complex business processes of our clients  which can make it difficult to properly scope the initial project or detect errors in our software prior to implementation 
we may not discover the existence of these problems until our customers install and use a given product or until the volume of services that a product provides increases 
in addition  when our software is installed  the technical environment into which it is installed is frequently complex and typically contains a wide variety of systems and third party software  with which our software must be integrated 
this can make the process of implementation itself difficult and lengthy 
as a result of these factors  some customers may have difficulty implementing our products successfully within anticipated timeframes or otherwise achieving the expected benefits 
these problems may result in claims for damages suffered by our clients  a loss of  or delays in  the market acceptance of our solutions  client dissatisfaction and lost revenue and collection difficulties during the period required to correct these errors 
we utilize third party software that we incorporate into and include with our products and solutions  and impaired relations with these third parties  defects in third party software or their inability or failure to enhance their software over time could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we incorporate and include third party software into and with our products and solutions 
we are likely to incorporate and include additional third party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings 
if our relations with any of these third parties are impaired  and if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software  our business could be harmed 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we utilize 
it may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software 
we utilize third parties to integrate our software with other software products and platforms 
if any of these third parties should cease to provide integration services to us  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on companies such as business objects  inovus  tibco software  vignette  and webmethods to integrate our software with software and platforms developed by third parties 
if relations with any of these third parties are impaired  and if we are unable to secure a replacement on a timely basis  our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed 
if these companies are unable to develop or maintain software that effectively integrates with our software and is free from defects  our ability to license our products and provide solutions could be impaired and our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance their software s capabilities 
our efforts to develop and sustain relationships with vendors such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others to market and implement our software products may fail  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we are developing  maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors  such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions 
we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
we may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively 
our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors 
there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products 
the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition 
government contracts are subject to cost and other audits by the government and terminations for the convenience of the government 
government procurement is highly regulated  and contractors are subject to the risks of protests  claims  penalties  fines  default termination  and rescission  among other actions 
the adverse result of a government audit or action against any of our contracts with the government could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
government contracts face special risks due to potential audits by government agencies 
a significant percentage of our revenue is from time to time derived from contracts with the federal government 
government contractors are commonly subject to various audits and investigations by government agencies 
one agency that oversees or enforces contract performance is the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the dcaa generally performs a review of a contractor s performance on its contracts  its pricing practices  costs and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards and to verify that costs have been properly charged to the government 
although the dcaa completed an initial review of our accounting practices and procedures allowing us to invoice the government  it has yet to exercise its option to perform an audit of our actual invoicing of government contracts 
these audits may occur several years after completion of the contract 
if an audit were to identify significant unallowable costs  we could have a material charge to our earnings or reduction to our cash position as a result of the audit and this could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with us federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us  whether or not true 
government contracts are subject to unique risks of early termination 
in addition  government contracts may be subject to termination by the government for its convenience  as well as termination  reduction or modification in the event of budgetary constraints or any change in the government s requirements 
if any of our time and materials or fixed priced contracts were to be terminated for the government s convenience  we would probably receive only the purchase price for items delivered prior to termination  reimbursement for allowable costs for work in progress and an allowance for profit on the contract  or an adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss 
government contracts are also conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis  even though the contract performance may extend over many years 
consequently  at the outset of a program  the contract is usually only partially funded  and congress must annually determine if additional funds will be appropriated to the program 
as a result  long term contracts are subject to cancellation if appropriations for future periods become unavailable 
we have not historically experienced any significant material adverse effects as a result of the government s failure to fund programs awarded to us 
if the government were to terminate some or all of our contracts or reduce appropriations for a program under which we have a contract  cancel appropriations  or both  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
competitive bidding  a cornerstone to government contracting  imposes risks and costs 
from time to time we derive significant revenue from federal contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process  which can impose substantial costs upon us 
we will lose revenue if we or our contracting partners typically  prime contractors with whom we subcontract fail to compete effectively 
competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks  including the need to bid before design is complete  bid and proposal costs  risks in estimation of prospective needs  and bid protests that may delay or derail awards 
our work with other contractors poses risks  including risks to our reputation 
as a prime contractor  we may rely upon other companies as subcontractors to perform work we are obligated to deliver to our clients 
a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to perform the agreed upon services on a timely and satisfactory basis may compromise our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor 
in some cases  we have limited involvement in the work performed by the subcontractor and may have exposure as a result of problems caused by the subcontractor 
in extreme cases  performance deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a government client terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability for the agency s costs of re procurement  damage our reputation  and hurt our ability to compete for future contracts 
additionally  we may have disputes with our subcontractors that could impair our ability to execute our contracts as required 
despite careful precautions that we take  we are exposed to risk due to potential employee misconduct in the highly regulated government marketplace 
we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with federal government procurement regulations  engaging in unauthorized activities  or falsifying time records 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  which could harm our business 
the government marketplace has a unique risk that appropriations to fund contracts will not be made  or will be diverted or delayed 
a decline in overall us government expenditures could cause a decrease in our revenue and adversely affect our operating performance 
defense spending levels may not continue at present levels  and future levels of expenditures and authorizations for existing programs may decline  remain constant  or shift to agencies or programs in areas where we do not currently have contracts 
a significant decline in defense expenditures  or a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support  could cause a material decline in our government related revenue 
federal contracts are subject to unique terms and risks  not commonly found in the commercial marketplace 
federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
these rights and remedies allow government clients  among other things  to terminate existing contracts for convenience  as well as default  reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts  often unilaterally  terminate security clearances and thereby prevent classified contracting  cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent years become unavailable  decline to exercise options to renew multi year contracts  claim rights in certain products  systems  and technology produced by us  prohibit future awards based on a finding of an organizational conflict of interest  subject contract awards to protest  and suspend or debar contractors 
our federal contracts pose unique pricing risks 
much of our federal contracting is done through a type of special contract  sponsored by the us general services administration gsa  known as the multiple award schedules or simply schedules contract 
our gsa schedules contract  like all others  includes a clause known as the price reductions clause  the terms of that clause are analogous to a most favored customer clause in commercial contracts 
under that clause  we have agreed that the prices to the government under the gsa schedules contract will maintain a constant relationship to the prices charged to certain commercial customers  ie  when prices to those benchmark customers drop  so too must our prices on our gsa schedules contract 
although we have undertaken extensive efforts to comply with the price reductions clause  it is possible that we  through  for example  an unreported discount offered to a benchmark customer  might fail to honor the obligations of the price reductions clause 
if that occurred  we could  under certain circumstances  be subject to an audit  an action in fraud  or other adverse government actions or penalties 
the limited ability of legal protections to safeguard our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to compete effectively 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality procedures and agreements  contractual provisions  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
the shift of an increasing amount of our product development work to india may increase this risk 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly in certain foreign countries  including  among others  india and the people s republic of china 
we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us furthermore  our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
our products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
the number of intellectual property claims in our industry may increase as the number of competing products grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
in recent years  there has been a tendency by software companies to file substantially increasing numbers of patent applications  including those for business methods and processes 
we have no way of knowing what patent applications third parties have filed until the application is published or until a patent is issued 
patent applications are often published within months of filing  but it can take as long as three years or more for a patent to be granted after an application has been filed 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to address  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 
our international operations pose risks for our business and financial condition 
we currently conduct operations in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  france  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  taiwan  the people s republic of china  singapore  and the united kingdom 
we recently opened a product development center in india  where we also have relationships with third parties to outsource a portion of our product development and implementation services effort 
we intend to expand our international operations and to increase the proportion of our revenue from outside the us these operations require significant management attention and financial resources and additionally subject us to risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities  failure to properly comply with us laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and services  difficulties in managing foreign operations and appropriate levels of staffing  foreign currency exposure  longer collection cycles  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  particularly throughout europe  proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences  anti american sentiment due to the war with iraq and other american policies that may be unpopular in certain countries  and increasing political instability  adverse economic conditions and the potential for war or other hostilities in many of these countries 
our failure to properly comply with or address any of the above factors could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
changes in the value of the us dollar  in relation to the currencies of foreign countries where we transact business  could harm our operating performance and financial condition 
for the fiscal year ended february   of our total revenue was derived from outside the us our primary international operations are located throughout europe and asia pacific 
we also have operations in brazil  canada and mexico 
our international revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  typically the local currency of the selling business unit 
therefore  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 
we generally do not implement hedging programs to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting international accounts receivable  cash balances and intercompany accounts  and we do not hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting future international revenue and expenses and other commitments 
for the foregoing reasons  currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused  and likely will continue to cause  variability in our foreign currency denominated revenue streams and costs and our cost to settle foreign currency denominated liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we may be subject to future liability claims  and the reputations of our company and products may suffer 
many of our implementations involve projects that are critical to the business operations of our clients and provide benefits  some of which may be difficult to quantify 
any failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into agreements with software vendors  consulting firms  resellers and others whereby they market and implement our solutions 
if these vendors fail to meet their clients expectations or cause failures in their clients systems  our reputation and that of our products could be materially and adversely affected even if our software products perform in accordance with their functional specifications 
we may choose to change our business practices or our earnings may be affected as a result of changes in the requirements relating to the accounting treatment of employee stock options 
generally accepted accounting principles in the us are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission  and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the implementation of a new accounting principle 
we currently account for stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and  accordingly  we only record compensation expense related to stock options if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of grant 
on december   the fasb published fasb statement no 
r share based payment fas r which was to be effective for public companies in periods beginning after june  on april   the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for fas r 
the new rule allows companies to implement fas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year instead of their next reporting period beginning after june  we will be required to implement fas r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal our earnings in fiscal could be significantly reduced as a result of changing our accounting policy in accordance with fas r 
as a result  we could decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees or attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we pay to employees 
such a change could have a material effect on our operating performance 
in june  the company s board of directors approved an amendment to the company s stock option plan to issue restricted shares of manugistics common stock to its employees 
this amendment was approved by shareholders at the company s annual meeting of shareholders on july  on november   the company issued million shares of restricted stock to certain key employees 
the restricted stock awards granted to key employees have a vesting schedule pursuant to which the stock award vests in three equal annual increments over three years from the date of grant  with the first increment vesting on november  the total value of the restricted stock awards granted of approximately million was computed using the closing stock price on the date of grant and a estimated forfeiture rate and was recorded as a component of deferred compensation 
the related compensation expense will be amortized over the vesting period 
during fiscal   shares were issued to the new chief executive officer  resulting in a combined increase in deferred compensation in stockholders equity of million 
all restricted shares issued to the chief executive officer fully vest on january  on october   the company issued  shares of restricted stock to certain key employees 
the restricted stock awards granted to key employees have a vesting schedule pursuant to which the stock award vests in four equal increments over four years from the date of grant  with the first increment vesting on april  the total value of the restricted stock awards granted of approximately million was computed using the closing stock price on the date of grant and was recorded as a component of deferred compensation 
the related compensation expense will be recognized and amortized over the vesting period 
the company recorded million in compensation expense related to restricted shares outstanding during fiscal it may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain insurance 
we obtain insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities 
in the current market  insurance coverage has become more restrictive  and when insurance coverage is offered  the deductible for which we are responsible is larger and premiums have increased substantially 
as a result  it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels  or if such coverage is available  the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially 
this may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance  which could have a material effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
significant declines in our stock price may result for various reasons  including poor financial performance 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
our stock price has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly revenue and operating results and continuing losses  corporate and consumer confidence in the economy  evidenced in part  by stock market levels  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts  changes in the performance  market valuations  or both  of our current and potential competitors and the software industry in general  our announcement or a competitor s announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of our technology in  or compatibility of our technology with  such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity about us  or our products  services or implementations  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding our competitors  including their products and implementations  additions or departures of key personnel  sales or anticipated sales of additional debt or equity securities  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  the nasdaq national market and the equity markets for software companies in particular  have experienced extraordinary price and volume volatility in recent years 
such volatility has adversely affected the stock prices for many companies irrespective of  or disproportionately to  the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely further affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our charter  bylaws and shareholder rights plan  delaware law and the indenture for the notes contain provisions that could discourage a takeover even if beneficial to stockholders 
in addition  certain of our current officers  directors  an entity affiliated with a director and one of our founders together may be able to exercise substantial influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
our charter and our bylaws  in conjunction with delaware law  contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our company even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders 
for example  our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors and allow our board of directors to expand its size and fill any vacancies without stockholder approval 
furthermore  our board has the authority to issue preferred stock and to designate the voting rights  dividend rate and privileges of the preferred stock  all of which may be greater than the rights of common stockholders 
additionally  upon a change of control of our company  the holders of the notes would have the right to require us or our successor to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase in cash 
this could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders 
on october   we adopted a shareholder rights plan that entitles our shareholders to rights to acquire shares of our series a junior participating preferred stock generally when a third party acquires twenty percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock or commences a tender offer or exchange offer for twenty percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
the shareholder rights plan could delay  deter or prevent an investor from acquiring us in a transaction that shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over their shares 
in addition  our current officers  directors  warburg pincus private equity viii  lp wp viii an entity affiliated with william h 
janeway  one of our directors  and one of our founders  william m 
gibson  together beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock at april  while these stockholders do not hold a majority of our outstanding common stock  if they were to vote together  they may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations and sales of our assets 
this factor may prevent or discourage tender offers for our common stock 
in connection with the appointment of mr 
janeway to the board in october  the company entered into a standstill agreement with wp viii under which wp viii agreed that it and certain of its affiliates would not acquire more than of the common stock of our company without our consent for a period of three years or until the earlier occurrence of certain specified events 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our current officers  directors  wp viii  an entity affiliated with william h 
janeway  one of our directors  and one of our founders  william m 
gibson  together beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock at april  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by these shareholders  or the perception that such sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risk 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
such changes could result in cumulative translation gains or losses that are included in shareholders equity 
revenue outside of the us as a percentage of total revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue outside the us is derived from operations in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  the people s republic of china  france  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  singapore  taiwan and the united kingdom 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies of these countries result in positive or negative fluctuations in the amounts relating to foreign operations reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
none of the components of our statement of operations were materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal  and we generally do not use foreign currency options and forward contracts to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
while we do not expect to incur material losses as a result of this currency risk  there can be no assurance that losses will not result 
interest rate risk 
our long term investments  marketable securities and certain cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk 
fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and  accordingly  if market interest rates increase  these investments will decline in value 
we manage this risk by maintaining an overall investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
all securities in our long term investment portfolio mature in two years or less 
instruments in our entire portfolio include  but are not limited to  commercial paper  money market instruments  bank time deposits and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national  state and local governments and agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
as of february  and february   the fair market value of our long term investments and marketable securities held was million and million  respectively 
we also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the us and foreign countries 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term deposits of the local bank 
the us federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest 
during fiscal  the federal reserve board increased the discount rate by basis points from to 
the federal reserve board subsequently raised the discount rate by basis points 
as of may   the discount rate was 
the weighted average yield on interest bearing investments held as of february  and february  was approximately and  respectively 
based on our investment holdings at february   a basis point decline in the average yield would reduce our annual interest income by million 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  long term investments and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry  and no single customer has accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue on an annual basis  although we have had customers which accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue on a quarterly basis 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
