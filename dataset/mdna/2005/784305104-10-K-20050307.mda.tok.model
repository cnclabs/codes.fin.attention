ordinarily  there are two types of rate increases general and offset 
general rate case decisions usually authorize an initial rate increase followed by two annual step increases designed to maintain the authorized return on equity over a three year period 
general rate applications are normally filed and processed during the last year covered by the most recent rate case in an attempt to avoid regulatory lag 
the purpose of an offset rate increase is to compensate utilities for increases in specific expenses  primarily for purchased water  pump tax or purchased power 
pursuant to section of the california public utilities code  a balancing account must be maintained for each expense item for which revenue offsets have been authorized eg  purchased water  purchased power and pump tax 
the purpose of a balancing account is to track the under collection or over collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the cpuc to offset those expense changes 
on november   the cpuc issued resolution w implementing significant changes in the long established offset rate increase and balancing account recovery procedures applicable to water utilities

the interim rates would be based on a water company s existing rates increased for the amount of inflation since the last approved rate adjustment 
the bill also allows for revenue reconciliation from the time of the implementation of the interim rates to the time of the cpuc s ultimate decision in the rate case 
in principle  this mechanism is designed to eliminate the adverse financial impact on water utilities caused by regulatory delays in general rate cases 
the bill was codified as public utilities code section and became effective on january  please also see the heading factors that may affect future results under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s critical accounting policies are as follows balancing account within its regulatory regime  the california public utilities commission cpuc establishes a memorandum type balancing account mechanism for the purpose of tracking the under collection or over collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the cpuc to offset those expense changes 
a separate balancing account must be maintained for each offset expense item eg  purchased water  purchased power and pump tax 
since balances are being tracked and have to be approved by the cpuc before they can be incorporated into rates  san jose water company has not recognized the expenses in the balancing account on its financial statements 
the balancing account balance varies with the seasonality of the water utility business such that during the summer months when the demand for water is at its peak  the balancing account tends to reflect an under collection  while during the winter months when demand for water is relatively lower  the balancing account tends to reflect an over collection 
had the balancing account been recognized in san jose water company s financial statements  san jose water company s retained earnings would be increased by the amount of balancing account over collection  as the case may be  or decreased by the amount of balancing account under collection  less applicable taxes

revenue from the meter reading date to the end of the accounting period is estimated based on historical usage patterns  production records and the effective tariff rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions which include the number of days between meter reads for each billing cycle  the customers consumption changes  and the san jose water company s experiences in unaccounted for water

the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded by san jose water company primarily relate to the recognition of deferred income taxes for ratemaking versus tax accounting purposes

san jose water company is regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc 
the operating revenue of san jose water company results from the sale of water at rates authorized by the cpuc 
the cpuc sets rates that are intended to provide revenues sufficient to recover operating expenses and produce a reasonable return on common equity 
as required by law  san jose water company files general rate applications with the cpuc on a periodic basis 
on may   san jose water company filed a general rate case application with the cpuc seeking authority to increase rates for  and to recover the higher costs of providing water service  including higher costs of power  purchased water  pump tax  labor  security  water quality testing and reporting  and to allow for necessary improvements to the water system 
since the cpuc was unable to finalize a decision on this request  pursuant to public utility code section pu code  san jose water company filed for and received a interim rate increase effective january  on september   the interim rate relief bill ab was signed into law and codified as pu code  effective january  this section allows for the implementation of interim water rates in general rate cases when the cpuc fails to establish new rates in accordance with the established rate case schedule 
the interim rates shall be based on a water company s existing rates increased for the amount of inflation since the last approved rate adjustment 
this section also allows for revenue reconciliation from the time of the implementation of the interim rates to the time of the cpuc s ultimate decision in the general rate case 
in principal  this mechanism is designed to eliminate the adverse financial impact on water utilities caused by regulatory delays in general rate cases 
on august   the cpuc issued its final decision in san jose water company s general rate case application with the new rates effective august  san jose water company was authorized rate increases of  or in   or in  and  or in the cpuc decision authorized a return on common equity in  and of  which is within the range of recent rates of return authorized by the cpuc for water utilities 
san jose water company was also authorized rate recovery of the current balance of  in its water contamination memorandum account  as well as recovery of an under collection of  accrued in its pre november  balancing account 
although san jose water company believes that the rates currently in effect provide it with a reasonable rate of return  there is no guarantee such rates will be sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return in the future 
there is no guarantee that the company s future rate filings will be able to obtain a satisfactory rate of return in a timely manner 
in addition  san jose water company relies on policies and regulations promulgated by the cpuc in order to  for example  recover capital expenditures  maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property  offset its production and operating costs  recover the cost of debt  maintain an optimal equity structure without over leveraging  and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non regulated operations 
if the cpuc implements policies and regulations that do not allow san jose water company to accomplish some or all of the items listed above  san jose water company s future operating results may be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the california public utilities code  a balancing account must be kept for each expense item for which revenue offsets have been authorized ie  purchased water  purchased power and pump tax 
the purpose of a balancing account is to track the under collection or over collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the cpuc to offset those expense changes 
on november   the cpuc issued resolution w the resolution implementing significant changes in the long established offset rate increase and balancing account recovery procedures applicable to water utilities 
these changes could have a significant impact on the risk profile of the water industry 
as required by the resolution  in december  the cpuc opened an order instituting rulemaking oir to evaluate existing balancing account and offset rate practices and policies 
on december   the cpuc issued an interim oir decision authorizing water utilities to recover the balancing account balances accrued prior to november   if the utility is not over earning as measured on a pro forma basis 
san jose water company had accrued an under collection of  in its balancing account prior to november  san jose water company was authorized rate recovery of the under collection of  accrued in its pre november  balancing account in its august  rate decision 
on june   the cpuc issued its final oir decision d 
in which the cpuc revised the existing procedures for recovery of under collections and over collections in balancing accounts existing on or after november   as follows if a utility is within its rate case cycle and is not over earning  the utility shall recover its balancing account subject to reasonableness review  and if a utility is either within or outside of its rate case cycle and is over earning  the utility s recovery of expenses from the balancing accounts will be reduced by the amount of the over earning  again subject to reasonableness review 
utilities shall use the recorded rate of return test to evaluate earnings for all years 
it is uncertain how any future cpuc regulation dealing with balancing account balances accrued after november  will affect san jose water company s ability to collect such balance or to receive future offset rate relief 
for the period from november   to december   the balancing account accumulated an under collection of  as of december   san jose water company has received all its offset rate requests 
any future impact on san jose water company s ability to recover balancing account balances and receive offset rate increases can not be determined until san jose water company s next offset rate increase request  which is anticipated for july  changes in water supply  water supply costs or the mix of water supply could adversely affect the operating results and business of san jose water company 
san jose water company s supply of water primarily relies upon three main sources water purchased from the scvwd  surface water from its santa cruz mountains watershed  and pumped underground water 
changes and variations in quantities from each of these three sources affect the overall mix of the water supply  therefore affecting the cost of water supply 
surface water is the least costly source of water 
if there is an adverse change to the mix of water supply and san jose water company is not allowed by the cpuc to recover the additional or increased water supply costs  its operating results may be adversely affected 
the scvwd receives an allotment of water from state and federal water projects 
if san jose water company has difficulties obtaining a high quality water supply from the scvwd due to availability or legal restrictions  it may not be able to satisfy customer demand in its service area and its operating results and business may be adversely affected 
additionally  the availability of water from san jose water company s santa cruz mountains watershed depends on the weather and fluctuates with each season 
in a normal year  surface water supply provides of the total water supply of the system 
in a dry season with little rainfall  water supply from surface water sources may be low  thereby causing san jose water company to increase the amount of water purchased from outside sources at a higher cost than surface water and thus increasing water production costs 
in addition  san jose water company s ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations 
if new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations  the availability of surface water may be materially reduced 
a reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources  thereby increasing the water production costs and adversely affecting the operating results of san jose water company 
because the extraction of water from the groundwater basin and the operation of the water distribution system require a significant amount of energy  increases in energy prices could increase operating expenses of san jose water company 
in the aftermath of the attempt to deregulate the california energy market  energy costs still remain in flux  with resulting uncertainty in the company s ability to contain energy costs into the future 
san jose water company continues to utilize pacific gas electric s time of use rate schedules to minimize its overall energy costs primarily for groundwater pumping 
during the winter months  typically or more of the groundwater is produced during off peak hours when electrical energy is consumed at the lowest rates 
optimization and energy management efficiency is achieved through the implementation of supervisory control and data acquisition scada system software applications that control pumps based on demand and cost of energy 
an increase in demand or a reduction in the availability of surface water or import water could result in the need to pump more water during peak hours adversely affecting the operating results of san jose water company 
fluctuations in customer demand for water due to seasonality  restrictions of use  weather and lifestyle can adversely affect operating results 
san jose water company operations are seasonal 
thus  results of operations for one quarter do not indicate results to be expected in subsequent quarters 
rainfall and other weather conditions also affect the operations of san jose water company 
most water consumption occurs during the third quarter of each year when weather tends to be warm and dry 
in drought seasons  if customers are encouraged and required to conserve water due to a shortage of water supply or restriction of use  revenue tends to be lower 
similarly  in unusually wet seasons  water supply tends to be higher and customer demand tends to be lower  again resulting in lower revenues 
furthermore  certain lifestyle choices made by customers can affect demand for water 
for example  a significant portion of residential water use is for outside irrigation of lawns and landscaping 
if there is a decreased desire by customers to maintain landscaping for their homes  residential water demand could decrease  which may result in lower revenues 
conservation efforts and construction codes  which require the use of low flow plumbing fixtures  could diminish water consumption and result in reduced revenue 
a contamination event or other decline in source water quality could affect the water supply of san jose water company and therefore adversely affect the business and operating results 
san jose water company is subject to certain water quality risks relating to environmental regulations 
through water quality compliance programs  san jose water company continually monitors for contamination and pollution of its sources of water 
in the event of a contamination  san jose water company will likely have to procure water from more costly sources and increase future capital expenditures 
although the costs would likely be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that cpuc would approve a rate increase to recover the costs 
san jose water company is subject to litigation risks concerning water quality and contamination 
although san jose water company has not been and is not a party to any environmental and product related lawsuits  such lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years 
if san jose water company is subject to an environmental or product related lawsuit  it might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether it would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties 
in addition  if current california law regarding cpuc s preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with california department of health services cdhs and united states environmental protection agency epa water quality standards changes  the legal exposure of san jose water company may be significantly increased 
new or more stringent environmental regulations could increase san jose water company s operating costs and affect its business 
san jose water company s operations are subject to water quality and pollution control regulations issued by the epa  the cdhs and the california regional water quality control board 
it is also subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by other state and local regulatory agencies 
stringent environmental and water quality regulations could increase san jose water company s water quality compliance costs  hamper san jose water company s available water supplies  and increase future capital expenditure 
under the federal safe drinking water act sdwa  san jose water company is subject to regulation by the epa of the quality of water it sells and treatment techniques it uses to make the water potable 
the epa promulgates nationally applicable standards  including maximum contaminant levels mcls for drinking water 
san jose water company is currently in compliance with all of the primary mcls promulgated to date 
there can be no assurance that san jose water company will be able to continue to comply with all water quality requirements 
san jose water company has implemented monitoring activities and installed specific water treatment improvements enabling it to comply with existing mcls and plan for compliance with future drinking water regulations 
however  the epa and cdhs have continuing authority to issue additional regulations under the sdwa 
it is possible that new or more stringent environmental standards could be imposed that will raise san jose water company s operating costs 
future drinking water regulations may require increased monitoring  additional treatment of underground water supplies  fluoridation of all supplies  more stringent performance standards for treatment plants and procedures to further reduce levels of disinfection byproducts 
san jose water company continues to seek to establish mechanisms for recovery of government mandated environmental compliance costs 
there are currently limited regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to the company for the recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered 
costs associated with security precautions may have an adverse effect on the operating results of san jose water company 
water utility companies have generally been on a heightened state of alert since the threats to the nation s health and security in the fall of san jose water company has taken steps to increase security at its water utility facilities and continues to implement a comprehensive security upgrade program for production and storage facilities  pump stations and company buildings 
san jose water company also coordinates security and planning information with scvwd  other bay area water utilities and various governmental and law enforcement agencies 
san jose water company conducted a system wide vulnerability assessment in compliance with federal regulations public law imposed on all water utilities 
the assessment report was filed with the epa on march  san jose water company has also actively participated in the security vulnerability assessment training offered by the american water works association research foundation and the epa 
the vulnerability assessment identified system security enhancements that impact water quality  health  safety and continuity of service totaling approximately  exclusive of the years to expenditures 
these improvements were incorporated into the capital budgets to be completed by for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  were spent on capital projects to improve and enhance security 
san jose water company has and will continue to bear costs associated with additional security precautions to protect its water utility business and other operations 
while some of these costs are likely to be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the cpuc will approve a rate increase to recover all or part of such costs  and as a result  the company s operating results and business may be adversely affected 
other factors that affect operating results 
other factors that could adversely affect the operating results of sjw corp 
and its subsidiaries include the following the level of labor and non labor operating and maintenance expenses as affected by inflationary forces and collective bargaining power could adversely affect the operating and maintenance expenses of sjw corp 
the city of cupertino s lease operation could be adversely affected by capital requirements  the ability of san jose water company to raise rates through the cupertino city council  and the level of operating and maintenance expenses 
if recycled water is widely accepted as a substitute to potable water and if rights are granted to others to serve san jose water company s customers recycled water  san jose water company s sales  revenue and operating results would be negatively impacted 
sjw land company s expenses and operating results also could be adversely affected by the parking lot activities  the hp pavilion at san jose events  ongoing local  state and federal land use development activities and regulations  future economic conditions  and the development and fluctuations in the sale of the undeveloped properties 
the san jose sharks  a professional hockey team  performs at the hp pavilion 
as a result of the cancellation of the hockey season by the national hockey league  sjw land company s parking lot revenue will be negatively impacted 
internal controls section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that sjw corp 
evaluates and reports on its system of internal controls 
in addition  the independent auditors must report on management s evaluation of those controls 
sjw corp 
has documented and tested its system of internal controls to provide the basis for its report 
if sjw corp 
s evaluation of internal controls and the independent auditors evaluation are unable to provide sjw corp 
with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of sjw corp 
s financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the intrinsic value of sjw corp 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
in december  finr was issued to replace fasb interpretation no 
for any variable interest entities vie or vies required to be consolidated under finr that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie initially were measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest recognized in the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts was not practicable  fair value at the date finr first applies could be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
the adoption of finr has resulted in the consolidation of the corporation s limited partnership interest in west santa clara street  lp as of january   which had previously been accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as described in note  partnership interest restatement  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements for and have been restated to reflect this change 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised statement no 
 share based payment statement r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise received employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
statement r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the statement r generally requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates an entity s ability to account for the share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under statement  as originally issued 
statement r is effective for public companies that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  sjw corp 
is utilizing a fair value option pricing model in calculating its options expense  which is an acceptable method under statement r  therefore  the adoption of statement r is not expected to have a material impact on the corporation s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
statement  exchanges of productive assets an amendment of opinion no 
as part of its short term international convergence project with the iasb  on december   the fasb issued statement to address the accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of productive assets 
statement amends apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary exchanges  which established a narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets from fair value measurement 
statement eliminates that exception and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
under statement  nonmonetary exchanges are required to be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gains or losses  if the fair value is determinable within reasonable limits and the transaction has commercial substance 
statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
an entity should apply the provisions of statement prospectively for nonmonetary asset exchange transactions in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of statement is not expected to have a material impact on the corporation s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
