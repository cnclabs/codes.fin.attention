foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct our business primarily in the us and europe  with transactions and cash flows denominated primarily in us dollars  euros and british pounds 
the functional currency of the parent company is us dollars  while the functional currency of each subsidiary is their local currency 
foreign currency transactions the parent company and many of our subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies foreign currencies 
some of these transactions result in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  for which the amount of cash to be received or paid in the future remains fixed in the foreign currency but changes from month to month in the entity s functional currency as the exchange rate between the foreign currency and the functional currency fluctuates 
the changes in the amount of functional currency to be received or paid are transaction gains and losses  which are  with the exception of those related to long term intercompany balances see below  reported in exchange gains  net in our consolidated statements of income in the periods in which the exchange rates fluctuate 
transaction gains and losses arising from assets and liabilities denominated in the same foreign currencies may offset each other  in part  acting as a natural hedge 
for example  if a us dollar functional currency entity holds both a receivable and a payable denominated in euros  and the us dollar weakens against the euro  the entity will experience a gain on its receivable and a loss on its payable 
where our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not naturally hedged  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the impact of transaction gains and losses 
our forward contracts generally range from one to three months in original maturity  are held by our us dollar and british pound functional currency companies  and require the sale of british pounds and euros and the purchase of functional currencies 
these forward contracts are economic hedges of our exposures but have not been designated as hedges as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for financial reporting purposes 
gains and losses resulting from the fluctuation in the exchange rates underlying these forward contracts are recorded in exchange gains  net in our consolidated statements of income in the periods in which the exchange rates fluctuate 
we recognized transaction gains  including gains and losses on forward contracts  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

form k part ii item a foreign currency denominated intercompany balances that are of a long term investment nature are also subject to transaction gains and losses each month  as the amount of functional currency that would be received or paid on settlement fluctuates each month as the underlying exchange rates change 
however  because settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  these transaction gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as translation adjustments see discussion below 
foreign exchange gains of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  arose from the revaluation of such balances 
foreign currency denominated long term intercompany balances outstanding at december  and and in excess of million individually are summarized below by the functional currency of the books where the balances are recorded 
changes in balances since december  generally represent foreign currency revaluation

accumulated translation adjustment losses at december  and were million and million  respectively 
accumulated translation adjustments will remain in our consolidated balance sheets until such time as we sell or otherwise dispose of a foreign subsidiary  if ever
