item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that require some of management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions that  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause our future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management s current estimates 
for additional information  see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein 
accounts receivable we have an allowance for doubtful accounts that serves to reduce the value of our gross accounts receivable to the amount we estimate we will ultimately collect 
the allowance for doubtful account contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the customer s credit worthiness 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers financial condition  our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
our assessment of this information forms the basis of our allowances 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish the allowance during the past three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate the allowance 
however  while these credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we established  it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in the future depending on changes in business conditions 
at september   our allowances were million  a change in credit worthiness of our customers would change our reserve by approximately million 
inventory we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity to markdown excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
judgment and uncertainty exists with respect to this estimate because it requires management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the markdown required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to markdown inventory during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate inventory markdowns 
while these markdowns have historically been within our expectations and the markdowns we established  it is possible that our reserves could be higher or lower in the future if our estimates are inaccurate 
at september   our inventory reserves were million  a change in credit worthiness of our customers would change our reserve by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we account for our goodwill under the goodwill impairment model set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we review the 
table of contents recorded value of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
we determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
estimating the fair value of the reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions about the reporting unit including assumptions about the future growth in revenue and costs  capital expenditures  industry economic factors and future business strategy 
the variability of the factors that management uses to perform the goodwill impairment test depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events and cash flows 
all such factors are interdependent and  therefore  do not change in isolation 
accordingly  our accounting estimates may change from period to period due to changing market factors 
if we had used other assumptions and estimates or if different conditions occurred in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
for example  based on available information as of our most recent review during the fourth quarter of fiscal  if our pre tax earnings were to have decreased by with respect to the pre tax earnings we used in our forecasts  the enterprise value of each of our divisions would have continued to exceed their respective net book values 
also  based on the same information  if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase by basis points the discount rate we used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  the fair value for each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value  except for the paperboard division 
under circumstances where the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  we would have completed the second step of the impairment analysis for that reporting unit 
we do not believe that such a change in the discount rate was appropriate at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal and no facts have come to our attention that would require us to perform an interim impairment analysis under sfas we completed the annual test of the goodwill associated with each of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of fiscal and we identified no indicators of impairment 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  in determining whether the carrying value of any of our long lived assets is impaired 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe no impairment indicators currently exist 
other intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we identify the weighted average lives of our intangible assets by category in note other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein 
we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
our self insurance liabilities contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions regarding and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred buy not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we utilize historical claims lag data provided by our claims administrators to compute the required estimated reserve rate per carrier 
we calculate our average monthly claims paid utilizing the actual monthly payments during the trailing month period 
at that time  we also calculate our required reserve utilizing the reserve rates discussed above 
during fiscal  the 
table of contents average monthly claims paid fluctuated between million and million and our average claims lag fluctuated between and times the average monthly claims paid 
our accrual at september   represents approximately times the average monthly claims paid 
health insurance costs have risen in recent years  but our reserves have historically been within our expectations 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in the average claims lag would change our reserve by approximately million 
workers compensation we purchase large risk deductible workers compensation policies for the majority of our workers compensation liabilities that are subject to various deductibles 
we calculate our workers compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors which are applied to total reserves as provided by the insurance companies we do business with 
our workers compensation liabilities contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions regarding the injury 
we rely on expertise and advice from our third party administrator  and development factors to form the basis of our reserve 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our workers compensation liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our workers compensation liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
although the cost of individual claims may vary over the life of the claim  the population taken as a whole has not changed significantly from our expectations a change in our development factors at september  would have resulted in an additional million of expense for the year 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowances and deferred income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review our estimates and assumptions of our estimated tax obligations using historical experience in the jurisdictions we do business in  and informed judgments 
a increase in our effective tax rate would increase tax expense from continuing operations by approximately million for fiscal while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our income tax exposure 
pension we have five defined benefit pension plans us qualified plans with approximately of our employees in the united states currently accruing benefits 
in addition  under several labor contracts  we make payments based on hours worked into multi employer pension plan trusts established for the benefit of certain collective bargaining employees in facilities both inside and outside the united states 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we describe these assumptions in note retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein  which include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels 
although there is authoritative guidance on how to select most of these assumptions  management must exercise some degree of judgment when selecting these assumptions 

table of contents the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables 
certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 
our discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on the moody s aa utility bond index 
we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to this bond index is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our plans 
in determining the appropriateness of utilizing the moody s aa utility bond index  we compared the average age and time to retirement for the participants in our plans and the maturity characteristics of the index 
for calculating net periodic pension cost for september  and september  we employed a discount rate of and  respectively 
the basis point reduction in our discount rate was the primary reason for the million reduction in funded status compared to the prior year 
in determining the long term rate of return for a plan  we consider the historical rates of return  the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies 
for fiscal  we used an expected return on plan assets of 
the plan assets were divided among various investment managers 
as of september   approximately of plan assets were invested with equity managers  approximately of plan assets were invested with fixed income managers  approximately of plan assets were invested with managers of alternative investments and approximately of the plan assets were held in a cash account 
the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods 
for fiscal  our pension plans had actual returns on assets of million as compared with expected returns on assets of million  which resulted in a net deferred gain of million 
at september  we had an unrecognized loss of million 
in fiscal  we expect to charge to net periodic pension cost approximately million of this unrecognized loss 
the amount of this unrecognized loss charged to pension cost in future years is dependent upon future interest rates and pension investment results 
a basis point change in the discount rate  expected increase in compensation levels  or the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal pension expense in millions basis point basis point increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets expected increase in compensation levels several factors influence our annual funding requirements 
for the us qualified plans  our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages 
such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes 
amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions 
the effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend in part on investment performance  funding decisions and employee demographics 
for fiscal and  there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plans required by erisa 
however  at management s discretion  we made cash contributions to the us qualified plans of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we do not have a minimum contribution to make to the us qualified plans 
based on current expectations  we anticipate contributing approximately million to the us qualified plans over the next two years 

table of contents segment and market information we report our results in three segments the packaging products segment  the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment  and the paperboard segment 
the following table shows certain operating data for our three segments 
we do not allocate certain of our income and expenses to our segments and  thus  the information that management uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts 
we report these items as non allocated expenses 
these items include restructuring and other costs and certain corporate expenses 
year ended september  in millions net sales aggregate packaging products merchandising displays and corrugated packaging paperboard total net sales intersegment packaging products merchandising displays and corrugated packaging paperboard total net sales unaffiliated customers packaging products merchandising displays and corrugated packaging paperboard total segment income packaging products merchandising displays and corrugated packaging paperboard restructuring and other costs non allocated expenses interest expense interest and other income expense minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary income from continuing operations before income taxes overview fiscal was a watershed year for rock tenn as a result of the acquisition on june  of the gspp folding carton and bleached paperboard operations 
through the acquisition  we greatly improved our business mix with the very low cost bleached paperboard mill and the gspp folding carton plants 
the supply demand characteristics of the bleached paperboard markets  and hence margins for bleached paperboard  have been superior to recycled paperboard over at least the last business cycle 
also  the addition of bleached paperboard  which is made from virgin fiber and requires less purchased fossil fuels for energy  reduces the percentage of our paperboard operations dependent on those inputs  both of which are characterized by highly volatile prices and have seen significant increases in prevailing prices in the last few 
table of contents years 
in addition  the gspp folding carton plants broaden our already very broad customer base  increasing our geographic and technological capabilities and provide significant opportunities to reduce our unit costs through administrative and operational synergies 
the gspp assets added million of net sales in the four months in fiscal we owned them  on million of pro forma annual net sales  and significantly increased our operating income and earnings per share 
our year end fiscal net debt  as defined see non gaap measures below  increased by million from september   although we paid in cash to fund the acquisition and related expenses 
this implied reduction of net debt resulted from increased cash flow from operations  which was million in fiscal and million in fiscal we believe we achieved an annualized run rate of acquisition synergies of million in the fourth fiscal quarter of and we expect to realize at least million in annualized synergies from the acquisition 
for additional information regarding the acquisition see note acquisitions  restructuring and other matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein 
our legacy operations posted mixed results during fiscal packaging products segment operating margins declined from of sales to as the contribution of the gspp folding carton plants was offset primarily by delays in board cost pass throughs  higher freight and other costs and the losses incurred in plants in the process of closure 
during the year we took steps to address margin issues in two of our poorest performing folding carton plants  closing one and raising prices and cutting costs in the other 
we expect that these actions  further recovery of board cost increases  and the contribution of the gspp assets including synergies will cause packaging segment margins to improve in fiscal sales of merchandising displays and corrugated packaging increased in fiscal as a result of the corrugator we acquired in august  however  segment operating margins declined to of sales from  as we were unable to fully recover higher costs through price increases or volume 
paperboard segment operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the operating income generated from the bleached paperboard mill and higher pricing for recycled paperboard partly recovering much higher energy  chemical and freight costs increases in the past two fiscal years 
our specialty paperboard mills performed very well and benefited from high operating rates due in part to our closure in fiscal of a specialty paperboard mill 
our coated recycled tons sold decreased in fiscal as demand weakened early in fiscal we expect to realize higher prices in fiscal for recycled paperboard  including corrugated medium 
however  much higher winter energy pricing will adversely affect operating results 
during fiscal  management engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating and improving the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act which we refer to as sarbanes oxley act 
these efforts required that we commit significant financial and managerial resources 
our third party costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act were approximately million during fiscal these costs are included in our non allocated expenses 
in addition  we expect to incur approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal to complete our first year of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
we will incur third party costs during fiscal to continue our efforts  including our evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting in our gspp operations  however  we currently expect these costs to be less than the costs we incurred with respect to fiscal results of operations we provide quarterly information in the following tables to reflect trends in our results of operations 
for additional discussion of quarterly information  see our quarterly reports on form q filed with the sec 
net sales unaffiliated customers net sales for fiscal increased to  million compared to  million in fiscal due to net sales increases in each of our segments 
net sales for fiscal increased to  million compared to  million in fiscal 
table of contents net sales aggregate packaging products segment first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year in millions the increase in packaging products segment net sales before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to net sales from the acquired gspp folding carton facilities  which accounted for net sales of million 
this increase was partially offset by reductions in other folding carton sales  primarily from facilities that we have either closed or are in the process of closing 
in the early part of fiscal  we will have the challenge of flowing through board cost increases across our packaging products segment 
for the most part  we are not limited by contract in our ability to pass through board cost increases  although contracts may impact the timing of our recovery of published board price increases 
for much of the rest of our packaging business  market forces will determine the timing and extent of our recovery of board price increases 
the increase in packaging products segment net sales before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to sales growth in our folding carton division where sales were up from the prior year period 
approximately million of the million increase in segment net sales was attributable to our fiscal acquisitions and the remainder was primarily due to internal growth 
competitive pricing significantly offset the contribution from increased net sales 
net sales aggregate merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year in millions the increase in merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment net sales before intersegment eliminations for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from our acquisition of the athens corrugator in august which we refer to as athens acquisition  which had net sales of million in fiscal net sales of merchandising displays declined for the year primarily due to lower sales in our fourth fiscal quarter 
we continue to seek to broaden our permanent and multi material display capabilities as well as developing theft deterrent solutions for high theft products that are sold by various classes of retailers 
we have made significant progress in the marketplace with our max pdq tm display 
we expect revenues to grow from our brand management group that joined us in fiscal the increase in merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment net sales before intersegment eliminations for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in net sales of merchandising displays due to strong demand and sales to new customers as we expanded our presence in the north american display business 
net sales of corrugated packaging and sheets increased or million due to increased volume and the athens acquisition  which contributed million in net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter of net sales aggregate paperboard segment first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year in millions 
table of contents the increase in paperboard segment net sales before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the combination of bleached paperboard and southern bleached softwood kraft pulp sales from our gspp acquisition and higher selling prices for recycled paperboard 
the effect of the higher sales price during the period was more than offset by a decrease in tons shipped by our coated recycled and specialty paperboard mills 
we expect to see some further price increases in the early part of fiscal as a result of price increases we previously announced 
however  the impact of announced board price increases will be dictated  in part  by market forces that determine the timing and extent of our recovery of the increases in a market that currently is subject to overcapacity 
our announced price increases were necessary primarily due to significantly increasing energy costs 
during fiscal  our recycled mills operated at of capacity compared to in fiscal recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal for the segment were  tons compared to  tons shipped in fiscal as a result of the gspp acquisition we sold  tons of bleached paperboard and  tons of southern bleached softwood kraft pulp  respectively 
laminated paperboard product net sales declined million primarily due to the actions we took in fiscal to exit certain laminated paperboard operations 
the increase in paperboard segment net sales before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a increase in paperboard tons shipped and an per ton increase in our average selling price for all tons shipped 
during fiscal  our recycled mills operated at of capacity compared to in fiscal total tons shipped in fiscal for the segment increased to  tons from  tons shipped in fiscal net sales of recycled fiber increased primarily due to increased fiber prices and volume 
sales of laminated paperboard products continued to decline as we continued to experience a decrease in demand for our products by customers in the ready to assemble furniture and book and binder industries  which during fiscal continued to be our primary laminated paperboard products markets  as well as continued competitive pricing 
net sales also decreased due to closures of our laminated plant facilities at the end of fiscal and second quarter of fiscal cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased to  million of net sales in fiscal from  million of net sales in fiscal primarily due to the gspp acquisition  and fiber  energy  chemical and freight costs at our recycled paperboard mills increased million  million  million and million  respectively on a volume adjusted basis

the impact of foreign currency transaction risk in fiscal compared to fiscal increased costs of goods sold by million 
cost of goods sold increased to  million of net sales in fiscal from  million of net sales in fiscal primarily due to million of net sales of increased fiber  energy  chemical and freight costs at our recycled paperboard mills 
fiber  energy  chemical and freight costs at our recycled paperboard mills increased million  million  million and million  respectively  on a volume adjusted basis 
in fiscal  we covered most of our winter requirements for natural gas purchases at a nymex equivalent price of less than per mmbtu million british thermal units 
in fiscal  we covered approximately two thirds of our winter energy purchases at a nymex equivalent price of approximately per mmbtu that resulted in a small benefit compared to the winter nymex contract close prices 
across our businesses we also experienced increased freight costs of million  excluding the million of recycled paperboard freight costs referred to above  increased group insurance expense of million  increased pension expense of million of net sales  and increased workers compensation expense of million during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in freight costs was primarily due to increased volumes associated with our increased net sales and  to a lesser degree  increased fuel surcharges 
partially offsetting these higher costs were lower expenses for maintenance and repairs of million 
we also partially offset the effect of these increased costs by leveraging certain fixed costs at our higher operating rates 
we have foreign currency transaction risk primarily due to our operations

the impact of foreign currency transaction risk in fiscal compared to fiscal reduced costs of goods sold by million 
we value the majority of our us inventories at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation method  which we believe generally results in a better matching of current costs and revenues than under the first in  first out  or fifo  inventory valuation method 
in periods of increasing costs  the lifo method generally results in higher cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
in periods of decreasing costs  the results are generally the opposite 
the following table illustrates the comparative effect of lifo and fifo accounting on our results of operations 
these supplemental fifo earnings reflect the after tax effect of eliminating the lifo adjustment each year 
fiscal fiscal fiscal lifo fifo lifo fifo lifo fifo in millions cost of goods sold net income net income is higher in fiscal under the lifo method than the fifo method 
generally accepted accounting principles requires that inventory acquired in an acquisition be valued at selling price less costs to sell  dispose and complete 
this value is generally higher than the cost to manufacture inventory 
for the gspp acquisition  the inventory value computed in this manner was million higher than the cost to manufacture 
during fiscal  this step up would have been expensed under the fifo method 
under our lifo inventory method  this higher cost remains in inventory until the inventory layer represented by this inventory is consumed 
to the extent inventory levels acquired in the gspp acquisition are lowered in the future  cost of goods sold could be higher than the normal cost to manufacture 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily as a result of the synergies we realized following the gspp acquisition and our continued focus on cost reductions and efficiency 
sg a expenses were million higher than fiscal primarily as a result of sg a from the gspp locations we acquired  the third party costs we incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  which were approximately million  and increased amortization expense of million from the gspp acquisition 
bad debt expense decreased million  and bonus expense and commission expense  excluding the impact of the gspp acquisition  decreased million and million  respectively

commission expense increased because of increased sales primarily of folding cartons 
bonuses and stock compensation expense increased due to the attainment of certain performance targets 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased primarily due to the fiscal acquisitions 
travel and entertainment expenses decreased primarily as a result of our continued focus on controlling costs 
at september   certain group insurance costs related to the indirect plant personnel were reclassified from sg a to cost of goods sold 
the prior year amounts were reclassified as well 
in addition  franchise taxes were reclassified from provision for income taxes to sg a

our operating margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal operating income in our recycled fiber division increased as a result of higher fiber prices and increased volume 
the operating loss generated by our laminated paperboard products operations increased million due to lower sales  continued pricing pressure  and rising material costs 
in our recycled paperboard mills  on a volume adjusted basis  fiber costs increased million  energy costs increased million  chemical costs 
table of contents increased million  and freight costs increased million  which more than offset the increased sales of million attributable to increased average selling prices 
the net impact of the increased average selling price and the increased fiber  energy  chemical and freight costs was a reduction in segment income of million 
other paperboard segment freight costs increased million 
additionally  group insurance expense increased million  pension expense increased million  inventory write downs related to closed plants increased million  bad debt expense increased million due to the change in credit quality of several customers  and workers compensation expense increased million 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased  or million  to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to our increased debt to finance the gspp acquisition 
the increase in our average outstanding borrowings increased interest expense by approximately million 
an increase in our effective interest rates  net of swaps  resulted in increased interest expense of approximately million 
interest expense for fiscal decreased  or million  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in our effective interest rates  net of swaps  resulted in decreased interest expense of approximately million 
the decrease in our average outstanding borrowings decreased interest expense by approximately million 
minority interest minority interest in income of our consolidated subsidiary for fiscal increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due our acquisition of our ownership share in gsd as part of the gspp acquisition

provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal compared to a provision of million for fiscal fiscal included a million benefit resulting from the resolution of historical federal and state tax deductions that we had previously reserved 
other adjustments to the statutory federal tax rate are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate our marginal effective income tax rate for fiscal to be approximately 
in fiscal  we reviewed our corporate structure and reorganized our corporate subsidiaries  reducing the number of corporate entities and the complexity of our organizational structure 
the changes we implemented as a result of this review resulted in a one time income tax benefit of million 
approximately million of the benefit related to the filing of amended tax returns for fiscal years and and comparable adjustments made to the fiscal tax returns 
the changes related to certain income apportionment factors and a correction of an allocation of intercompany charges 
the impact of these changes was not material to our net income for any of the fiscal years in question  therefore  we recorded the cumulative impact in the current period 
the remaining million tax benefit relates to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance for net operating loss carry forwards which we refer to as nols and credits that we had previously concluded were not realizable 
we anticipate that the restructuring will allow us to realize the benefit of these nols in future years 
due to these one time tax benefits  our fiscal and fiscal effective income tax rates of and  respectively are not comparable 
the american jobs creation act of creates a temporary incentive for united states corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
we plan to repatriate million in extraordinary dividends  as defined in the jobs creation act  during the quarter ending december  accordingly  we recorded a tax liability of million as of september

we received cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the plastic packaging division and we recorded an after tax gain of approximately million 
the sale of certain cartem wilco assets and liabilities resulted in no gain or loss and we received cash proceeds of approximately million 
we have reclassified the results of operations for these components as income from discontinued operations  net of tax  on the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations in fiscal was million due to declining sales prices of case ready meat packaging  higher raw material costs  primarily resin  and a shift toward lower margin extruded roll stock sales

the sum of cash and cash equivalents and investment in marketable securities was million at september   compared to million at september   an aggregate decrease of million 
our debt balance at september   was million compared with million on september   an increase of million  which primarily reflects the debt incurred to finance the gspp acquisition 
our debt exposes us to changes in interest rates 
we use swap instruments to manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt 
in may  we paid million to terminate million of long term fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
in june and september  we entered into million notional amount and million notional amount of floating to fixed interest rate swaps  respectively  and designated them as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments for a like amount of our floating rate debt 
the start date of the million is effective september  we financed the gspp acquisition of million  including related costs  with million in financing from a new secured 
table of contents credit facility which we refer to as the senior credit facility that we entered into contemporaneously with the closing of the gspp acquisition  million in financing from our existing million receivables backed financing facility and cash on hand 
we have established a goal to reduce our debt by million by september for this goal  we assumed our debt would equal our march   net debt as defined of million plus the purchase price of million and that we would reduce our net debt to million by september our actual net debt at the end of september  was million  implying that we reduced pro forma net debt by million 
we are ahead of our expectations for debt reduction after the gspp acquisition 
the senior credit facility includes revolving credit  swing  and term loan facilities in the aggregate principal amount of million

net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million and million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations  increased depreciation and amortization  and net decreases in working capital 
the net decreases in working capital were primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was reduced by million of cash taxes paid on the sale of our plastic packaging division  which we are required to record as a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities 
the remaining decrease is primarily the result of working capital changes to support our increased sales levels and decreased earnings from continuing operations 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of the million purchase price of the gspp acquisition  million of capital expenditures that were partially offset by net sales of million of marketable securities  and proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million  primarily from previously idled facilities and equipment 
fiscal consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million  and net purchases of million of marketable securities  and our athens acquisition for which the purchase price was million  and were largely offset by the million that we received from the sale of the plastic packaging division and million that we received from the sale of certain cartem wilco assets and liabilities

partially offsetting these sources of cash were repayments of debt  cash dividends paid to shareholders  and distributions to the minority interest partner in our rts joint venture  debt issuance costs  and the repurchase of common stock 
our capital expenditures aggregated million in fiscal we used these expenditures primarily for the purchase and upgrading of machinery and equipment 
we estimate that our capital expenditures will aggregate approximately million in fiscal and we are obligated to purchase million of fixed assets at september  we intend to use these expenditures for the purchase and upgrading of machinery and equipment  including growth and efficiency capital focused on our folding carton business  and maintenance capital 
we believe that our financial position would support higher levels of capital expenditures  if justified by opportunities to increase revenues or reduce costs  and we continuously review new investment opportunities 
accordingly  it is possible that our capital expenditures in fiscal could be higher than currently anticipated 
as a result of the step up in basis related to the acquisition of the gulf states fixed assets and the future tax depreciation from these assets  we do not anticipate paying any federal income taxes over the next two fiscal years 
we anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures  interest payments  stock repurchases  dividends  pension payments  working capital needs  and repayments of current portion of long term debt for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and receivables backed financing facility  proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other additional long term debt financing

table of contents contractual obligations we summarize in the following table our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we based some of the amounts in this table on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors

d under the terms of the joint venture agreement  lafarge has the option to terminate the joint venture and require us to purchase its interest in seven hills on march   and annually thereafter at a formula price that would result in a purchase price of less than of lafarge s net equity investment 
we have included an estimate of this contingent obligation in the table 
we have included approximately million in the table under the column fiscal 
e we have not included in the table above an item labeled other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because none of our other long term liabilities have a definite pay out scheme 
as discussed in note retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein  we have long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension  supplemental retirement plans  and deferred compensation 
we have not included in the table the payments related to the supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation because these amounts are dependent upon  among other things  when the employee retires or leaves our company  and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
our objective is to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them 
when evaluating these strategies  we evaluate the fundamentals of each market  our sensitivity to movement in commodity pricing  and underlying accounting and business implications 
to implement these strategies  we periodically enter into various hedging transactions 
the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
there can be no assurance that we will manage or continue to manage any such risks in the future or that any such efforts will be successful 
derivative instruments we enter into a variety of derivative transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics on a portion of our outstanding debt 
we evaluate market conditions and our leverage ratio in order to determine our tolerance for potential increases in interest expense that could result from floating interest rates 
we use forward contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuations in non functional foreign currency rates with respect to our operating units receivables 
we also use commodity swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling sales prices and rising raw material costs 
we account for derivative instruments and transactions based on whether the derivative instrument is designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge as more fully described in note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein 
in fiscal  we paid million to terminate million notional amount of long term fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
during fiscal  we realized cash proceeds of million by terminating interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and entering into comparable replacement interest rate swaps at then current market levels 
we do not expect any material impact on net income or change in interest rate risk from these transactions relative to our position before we entered into these transactions 

table of contents interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt 
we use swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt 
based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september  and september   if market interest rates increase an average of basis points  after considering the effects of our swaps  our interest expense would have increased by million and million  respectively 
we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
market risks impacting pension plans our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment 
adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities 
during fiscal and  the effect of a change in the discount rate would have impacted income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
our principal foreign exchange exposure is the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
we have transaction gains or losses that result from changes in our operating units non functional currency 
for example  we have non functional currency exposure at our canadian operations because they have purchases and sales denominated in us dollars 
we record these gains or losses in foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement 
from time to time  we enter into currency forward or option contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure 
we recorded losses of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and a gain of million in fiscal to mitigate potential foreign currency transaction losses  we may use offsetting internal exposures or forward contracts 
we also have translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes 
as a result of the canadian dollar strengthening in relation to the us dollar  our translated  before tax earnings from our canadian operations were increased 
translated earnings were also million higher in fiscal than if we translated the same earnings using fiscal exchange rates 
translated earnings were million higher in fiscal than if we translated the same earnings using fiscal exchange rates 
commodities the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and corrugating medium is recycled fiber 
our purchases of old corrugated containers and double lined kraft clippings account for our largest fiber costs and approximately of our fiscal year fiber purchases 
the remaining of our fiber purchases consists of a number of other grades of recycled paper 
from time to time we make use of financial swap agreements to limit our exposure to changes in occ prices 
with the effect of our occ swaps  a hypothetical increase in total fiber prices would have increased our costs by million in fiscal and  respectively 
in times of higher fiber prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of the increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
coated unbleached kraft we purchase coated unbleached kraft which we refer to as cuk from external sources to use in our folding carton converting business 
a hypothetical increase in cuk prices would have increased our costs by approximately million during fiscal and by approximately million during fiscal in times of 
table of contents higher cuk prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
linerboard corrugating medium we have the capacity to produce approximately  tons per year of corrugating medium at our st 
paul  minnesota operation 
from time to time  we make use of swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling corrugating medium prices at our st 
paul operation 
we estimate market risk as a hypothetical decrease in selling price 
with the effect of our medium swaps  such a decrease would have resulted in lower sales of approximately million during both fiscal and fiscal we convert approximately  tons per year of corrugating medium and linerboard in our corrugated box converting operations 
a hypothetical increase in linerboard and corrugating medium pricing would have resulted in increased costs of approximately million during both fiscal and fiscal we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
energy energy is one of the most significant manufacturing costs of our paperboard operations 
we use natural gas  electricity  fuel oil and coal to generate steam used in the paper making process and to operate our recycled paperboard machines and primarily electricity for our converting equipment 
our bleached paperboard mill uses wood by products for most of its energy 
we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market rates 
occasionally  we enter into long term agreements to purchase natural gas 
we spent approximately million on all energy sources in fiscal natural gas accounted for approximately million mmbtu of our total purchases in fiscal without the effect of fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy would have increased our cost of energy by million 
we spent approximately million on energy in fiscal natural gas accounted for approximately million mmbtu of our total energy purchases in fiscal without the effect of fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy would have increased our cost of energy by million during fiscal we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we periodically evaluate alternative scenarios to manage these risks
