item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k and in conjunction with the risk factors described below 
overview we are a provider of technology and systems that allow our customers to test and measure the performance  functionality  and conformance of internet protocol ip equipment and networks  and the applications that run over them 
our solutions generate  capture  characterize  and analyze high volumes of realistic network and application traffic  exposing problems  assessing performance  and verifying conformance to industry specifications 
we offer a single hardware platform with interchangeable interfaces  utilizing a single set of applications and application programming interfaces apis which allows our customers to create a fully integrated  easy to use test bed 
the networks our systems analyze include ethernet networks operating at speeds of up to gigabits per second  which carry data traffic over optical fiber or electrical cable 
other networks include packet over sonet networks operating at speeds of up to gigabits per second which transmit information over high speed optical links and asynchronous transfer mode atm networks  operating at speeds of up to megabits per second 
our telephony test suite is used to test and verify traditional time division multiplexing tdm voice based networks and voice over ip technology  devices  and systems 
our customers also use ixia s performance applications to test and verify web  internet  security  and business applications 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our net revenues by principal product category in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  product category in thousands  except percentages ethernet sonet software chassis and other total over the last three years  revenues from ethernet interface cards has increased while revenues from sonet interface cards declined in from the prior year and increased only slightly in over generally  ethernet interface cards are used to test equipment that is used at the edge of the internet and in enterprise applications  where demand has been increasing over the last two years 
sonet interface cards are used to test equipment that is used in core of the internet and in telecommunications applications  where demand has weakened over the past two years 
looking forward  we expect demand for our ethernet interface cards to remain strong and we expect demand for our sonet interface cards to remain soft 
over the same time period  software revenues have increased both in dollar terms and as a percentage of revenue 
this increase in software revenues is the result of our strategy to use specialized software applications to drive demand for our proprietary hardware platform 
we expect software revenues to continue to increase both in dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues 
sales to our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately million  or  of our net revenues in  million  or  in and million  or  in to date  we have sold our systems primarily to network equipment manufacturers 
while we expect that we will continue to have some customer concentration for the foreseeable future  we have sold our systems to a wide variety of customers 
during  we shipped our systems to customers  including over new customers in to the extent we develop a broader and more diverse customer base  we anticipate that our reliance on any one customer will decline 

table of contents net revenues 
our revenues consist primarily of hardware and software product sales 
in some instances our software products are installed and run on other companies hardware 
at other times  software products are installed on our hardware products and are an integral part of the functionality of the hardware 
our products are fully functional at the time of shipment and do not require significant production  modification or customization 
accordingly  revenues from product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  title has transferred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is deemed probable 
when a sale involves multiple elements typically sales of products that include warranty support and services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
we determine vsoe based on sales prices charged to customers when the same element is sold separately or based upon renewal pricing 
revenue is recognized on multiple element arrangements as each element is delivered  provided the other revenue recognition criteria noted above have also been met 
warranty support and service revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
we use distributors to market and sell our systems primarily outside the united states and japan 
due to the broad range of features and options available with our hardware and software products  distributors generally do not stock our products and typically place orders with us after receiving an order from an end customer 
these distributors receive business terms of sale similar to those received by our other customers 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  payments to third party manufacturers  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel and the warranty cost of hardware to be replaced during the warranty period  typically one year 
we outsource the majority of our manufacturing operations  and we conduct final assembly  supply chain management  quality assurance  documentation control and shipping at our facility 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
cost of revenues also includes royalties and amortization of purchased technology in connection with the rights acquired from netiq corporation netiq in july related to our ixchariot products and the amortization of purchased technology from the february acquisition of g nova technology  inc g nova related to our ixvoice products for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  cost of revenues includes a non cash component related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation allocated to manufacturing personnel 
gross margins 
gross margins of our various interface cards and software products have generally been consistent and have exceeded the gross margins of our chassis 
in general  our gross margins are primarily affected by the following factors the pricing we are able to obtain from our component suppliers and contract manufacturers  the mix of our products sold  including the mix of software versus hardware sales  new product introductions by us and by our competitors  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  demand for our products  expenses related to acquired technologies  such as royalties and amortization of intangible assets  production volume  and the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold 
in the near term  we anticipate gross margins as a percentage of net revenues to remain consistent 

table of contents operating expenses 
we generally recognize our operating expenses as we incur them in three major operational categories research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative and amortization of certain purchased intangible assets 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel and consulting costs related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our systems 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we also capitalize and depreciate over a five year period costs of our systems used for internal purposes 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in dollar terms as we seek to attain our strategic product development objectives and to meet changing customer requirements and technological advances  and due to an increase in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to individuals engaged in research and development activities as a result of the adoption of the recently issued sfas r see additional information in the recent accounting pronouncements section below 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales and marketing and customer support functions  as well as costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar terms in the near term related to anticipated increases in headcount  higher sales volumes and due to an increase in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to individuals engaged in sales and marketing activities as a result of the adoption of the recently issued sfas r 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  human resources  information technology and administrative personnel  as well as recruiting and professional fees  insurance costs and other general corporate expenses  including rent 
we expect sequential increases in dollar terms in general and administrative expenses as we continue to build out our administrative infrastructure to support our anticipated growth and due to an increase in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to general and administrative individuals as a result of the adoption of the recently issued sfas r 
amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of the purchase price of various intangible assets over their expected useful lives 
periodically we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
an impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value in the period that the impairment circumstances occurred 
deferred stock based compensation  recorded in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet  represents the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of the options or warrants at the date of grant or the purchase price of the restricted stock 
deferred stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity  with amortization recorded over the vesting period which is typically four years 
we intend to adopt the recently issued sfas r in our third quarter beginning july  under sfas r  deferred stock based compensation will be determined based on the appropriate fair value model and will result in an increase in deferred stock based compensation and associated amortization as discussed above 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
interest and other income  net represents interest on cash and a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government  federal agency and corporate debt securities  and certain foreign currency gains and losses 
income tax expense is determined based on the amount of earnings and enacted federal  state and foreign tax rates  adjusted for allowable credits and the effects of equity compensation plans 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  write downs for obsolete inventory  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
we recognize revenue as discussed in net revenues in the overview section of item allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience  current customer information and other relevant data 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances of days and over are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
write down of obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand is less favorable than as projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
acquisition purchase price allocation 
when we acquire a business  product line or rights to a product or technology  we allocate the purchase price  including related transaction fees  to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
to assist in this process  we may obtain appraisals from valuation specialists for certain intangible assets 
most of the assumptions used to determine fair value are made based on forecasted information 
the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for reasonableness periodically by management in light of current conditions 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable definite life intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas which generally requires that we assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
to the extent that the estimated undiscounted cash flows fall below the carrying value of the intangible or other long lived assets we 
table of contents write down the assets to fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on discounted cash flows 
we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill in accordance with sfas which requires us to assess our goodwill annually for impairment 
impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities  including threatened or pending litigation  in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  and we record accruals when the loss is deemed probable and the liability can reasonably be estimated 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances of each situation and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fin r reporting variable interests in specified assets of variable interest entities under paragraph of fasb interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the fsp states that a specified asset of a variable interest entity and the liability secured by the asset should not be deemed a separate variable interest entity 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf no 
requires disclosures about investments accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  in an unrealized loss position and are designed to help financial statement users analyze a company s unrealized losses and better understand the basis for any management conclusion that the impairment is temporary 
all new disclosures are effective for the annual reporting period ended december  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock of a corporation  provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of the american jobs creations act ajca provides an dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer provided certain criteria are met 
fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
we do not expect the adoption of fas to have material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we intend to adopt sfas r in our third quarter beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and  given that we have historically granted a significant amount of stock options to employees  expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the fair value model or transition method that we will adopt  or the effect of adopting sfas r including whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas risk factors the statements that are not historical facts contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements reflect the current belief  expectations or intent of the company s management and are subject to and involve certain 
table of contents risks and uncertainties 
many of these risks and uncertainties are outside of our control and are difficult for us to forecast or mitigate 
in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in certain of our other securities and exchange act commission filings  the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by us in any forward looking statements contained herein or made elsewhere by or on behalf of the company 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of new product introductions and other factors which could cause our stock price to decline significantly our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  most of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that could cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate include the other risks discussed in this risk factors section 
we may experience a shortfall or delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons 
orders on hand at the beginning of a quarter and orders generated in a quarter do not always result in the shipment of products and the recognition of revenues for that quarter 
failure to ship products by the end of the quarter in which they are ordered may adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
our customer agreements typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty 
because we incur operating expenses based on anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our results of operations 
additionally  our operating results may vary as a result of the timing of our release of new products 
the introduction of a new product in any quarter may cause an increase in revenues in that quarter that may not be sustainable in subsequent quarters 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new products to keep pace with the rapid technological changes that characterize our market  our results of operations will be significantly harmed the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change such as the recent development of optical fiber and wireless technologies  frequent new product introductions such as higher speed and more complex routers  evolving industry standards such as new internet protocols  changing customer needs such as the increase in the levels of service agreed to between network service providers and their customers  and short product life cycles as a result of rapid changes in our customers products 
our performance will depend on our successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced performance analysis products that address new technologies and changes in customer requirements 
if we experience any delay in the development or introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products  our operating results may suffer 
for instance  undetected software or hardware errors  which frequently occur when new products are first introduced  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and the loss of credibility with our customers 
in addition  if we are not able to develop  or license or acquire from third parties  the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements  our existing products are likely to become technologically obsolete over time and our operating results will suffer 
if the rate of development of new technologies and transmission protocols by our customers is delayed  the growth of the market for our products and therefore our sales and operating results may be harmed 

table of contents our ability to successfully introduce new products in a timely fashion will depend on several factors  including our ability to anticipate technological changes and industry trends  properly identify customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  hire and retain necessary technical personnel  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  timely obtain key components for the manufacture of new products  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  price our products competitively  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely or cost effective basis 
further  we cannot be certain that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  emerging industry standards or product announcements by our competitors 
if we fail to respond to technological change and the needs of our markets  we will lose revenues and our competitive position will suffer 
we depend on sales of a narrow range of products and if customers do not purchase our products  our revenues and results of operations would be significantly harmed our business and products are concentrated in the market for systems that analyze and measure the performance of network equipment and systems 
this market is in an evolving market and there is uncertainty regarding its size and scope 
our performance will depend on increased sales of our existing systems and the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing these sales or in developing and introducing new products 
our failure to do so would significantly harm our revenues and results of operations 
competition in our market could significantly harm our results of operations the market for our products is highly competitive 
we face competition primarily from test equipment manufacturers such as agilent technologies  spirent communications and anritsu 
we also compete with a number of small companies which are focused on network performance analysis and measurement 
additionally  some of our network equipment manufacturer customers have developed  or may develop  in house performance analysis products for their own use or for sale to others 
for example  cisco systems  our largest customer  has used internally developed test products for a number of years 
although cisco systems has in the past accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues  we cannot be certain that it will continue to do so 
as we broaden our product offerings  we may move into new markets and face additional competition 
moreover  our competitors may have more experience operating in these new markets and be better established with the customers in these new markets 

table of contents some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution capabilities than we do 
moreover  our competitors may consolidate with each other  or with other companies  giving them even greater capabilities with which to compete against us 
increased competition in the network performance analysis and measurement market could result in increased pressure on us to reduce prices and could result in a reduction in our revenues and or a decrease in our margins  each of which could significantly harm our results of operations 
in addition  increased competition could prevent us from increasing our market share  or cause us to lose our existing market share  either of which would harm our revenues and profitability 
we cannot predict whether our current or future competitors will develop or market technologies and products that offer higher performance or more features or are more cost effective than our current or future products 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop cost effective products and product enhancements which offer higher performance and more functionality 
our failure to do so will harm our revenues and results of operations 
if we do not diversify our customer base  we may not be able to grow our business or increase our profitability our growth depends in part on our ability to diversify our customer base by increasing sales to enterprises  internet and network service providers and communications chip manufacturers 
to effectively compete for the business of these customers  we must develop new products and enhancements to existing products and expand our sales  marketing and customer support capabilities  which will result in increases in operating costs 
if we cannot offset these increases in costs with an increase in our revenues  our net income may decrease 
some of our existing and potential competitors have existing relationships with many internet and network service providers  communications chip manufacturers and enterprises 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing our sales presence in these markets 
any failure by us to increase sales in these markets would adversely affect our growth 
because we depend on a limited number of network equipment manufacturers for a majority of our revenues  any cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations historically  a small number of network equipment manufacturing customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues 
sales to our five largest customers represented of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in sales to cisco systems  our largest customer  accounted for of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future and that our operating results will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers 
our dependence on large orders from a limited number of network equipment manufacturers makes our relationships with these manufacturers critical to the success of our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our largest customers  that we will be able to increase our sales to our other existing customers or that we will be able to attract additional customers 
from time to time  we have experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers 
in addition  our customers have sought price concessions from us and may continue to do so 
we typically do not have long term contracts with our customers  and our major customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our competitors 
the loss of one or more of our largest customers  any reduction or delay in sales to these customers  our inability to successfully develop and maintain relationships with existing and new customers or requirements that we make price concessions could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations 

table of contents our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and market conditions our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally and  in particular  market conditions in the communications and networking industries 
in the past  our operating results were adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending in the united states  europe and asia 
in particular  sales to network equipment manufacturers in north america were significantly and adversely affected by the downturn in the economy in the past 
if there is a slowdown in the global economy and market conditions  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
man made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results despite our implementation of network security measures  our network may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruption to the economy and create further uncertainties in the economy 
energy shortages  such as gas or electricity shortages  could have similar negative impacts 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
international activity may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our business we plan to continue to expand our international operations and sales activities 
expansion of international operations will involve inherent risks that we may not be able to control  including supporting multiple languages  recruiting and training international personnel  increased complexity and costs of managing international operations  increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  commercial laws and business practices that favor local competition  changing governmental laws and regulations  including differing labor and employment laws and longer sales cycles  difficulties in collecting receivables  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights  more complicated logistical and distribution arrangements  and political and economic instability 

table of contents as our customers consolidate  they may reduce purchases of our products and demand more favorable terms and conditions from us  which would harm our revenues and profitability consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold 
these merged customers could obtain products from a source other than us or demand more favorable terms and conditions from us  which would harm our revenues and profitability 
in addition  our network equipment manufacturer customers may merge with or acquire our competitors and discontinue their relationships with us 
acquisitions undertaken and any that we may undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute shareholder value and significantly harm our operating results acquisitions are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we expect to continue to review opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
while we are not currently a party to any acquisition agreements  we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any further acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute existing shareholders percentage ownership  and we could incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following problems assimilating the acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers  contract manufacturers  customers and industry experts  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of the acquired organization s or our own key employees 
we recorded impairment charges of million in and  in relating to the october acquisition of caimis  inc the charges recorded in resulted from the decline in business conditions in and our restructuring of our resources to focus on higher growth opportunities than the caimis products 
in  the continued lack of customer interest in these products resulted in the write off of the remaining caimis investment 
we cannot be certain that we would be successful in overcoming problems in connection with our past or future acquisitions  and our inability to do so could significantly harm our assets acquired in such acquisitions  revenues and results of operations 
if we are unable to expand our sales and distribution channels or are unable to successfully manage our expanded sales organization  our revenues and results of operations will be harmed historically  we have relied primarily on a limited direct sales organization  supported by third party manufacturers representatives and distributors  to sell our products 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding our direct sales organization and our network of manufacturers representatives and distributors 
we may not be able to successfully expand our sales and distribution channels  and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenues that we generate 
to the extent that we are successful in expanding our sales and distribution channels  we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against the significantly larger and better funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential competitors 
in some cases  we have granted exclusive rights to our distributors and manufacturers representatives to market our products in their specified territories 
our distributors and manufacturers representatives may not market our products 
table of contents effectively or devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
our inability to effectively manage the expansion of our sales and support staff  or to maintain existing or establish new relationships with successful manufacturers representatives and distributors  would harm our revenues and results of operations 
if we are unable to expand our international sales and distribution channels or manage them effectively  our results of operations would be harmed historically  a significant portion of our sales have been made to customers in the united states 
sales in the united states accounted for of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in in the past  we have depended on distributors for a substantial portion of our international sales 
in  two of our distributors entered bankruptcy and were therefore terminated as distributors of our products 
these terminations and additional future losses of one or more of our international distributors or their failure to sell our products would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenues in international markets 
in october  we established a japanese subsidiary in tokyo  japan 
we intend to expand into additional international markets  including in europe and in the asia pacific region  by adding distributors and international sales and support personnel 
our failure in these efforts could significantly harm our results of operations and decrease the value of our stock 
changes in laws  regulations and financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations changes in accounting regulations and standards can have a significant effect on our reported results 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future as a result of recent congressional and regulatory actions 
new laws  regulations and accounting standards  as well as the questioning of  or changes to  currently accepted accounting practices in the technology industry may adversely affect our reported financial results  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
in particular  the fasb recently enacted sfas r which requires the recording of compensation expense associated with stock option grants on our income statement 
the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on  among other things  the estimated volatility of the underlying stock 
our stock price has historically been volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options will negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price 
in addition  the adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit and retain employees 
additionally  the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations may result in changes in accepted practices within our industry and may adversely impact our stock price 
additionally  these regulations may increase our cost of doing business and adversely impact our profitability 
some key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply  which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase a number of key components used to manufacture our products from sole or limited sources of supply for which alternative sources may not be available 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages of key components  including chips  oscillators and optical modules 
we and our contract manufacturers have no guaranteed or long term supply arrangements for these or other components  including field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  which are integrated circuits that can be repeatedly reprogrammed to perform different sets of functions as required 
financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in market demand for necessary components could limit the availability to us and our contract manufacturers of these components 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales 
in addition  the purchase of these components on a sole source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems 
consolidation involving suppliers could further reduce the number of 
table of contents alternatives available to us and affect the cost of components 
an increase in the cost of components could make our products less competitive and result in lower margins 
there are limited substitute supplies available for many of these components  including field programmable gate arrays 
all of these components are critical to the production of our products  and competition exists with other manufacturers for these key components 
in the event that we can no longer obtain materials from a sole source supplier  we might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion  or at all 
if we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs and experience manufacturing delays we provide our contract manufacturers with rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our manufacturing requirements 
some of the components used in our products have significant lead times or lead times which may unexpectedly increase depending on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and the demand for components at a given time 
because of these long lead times  we are often required to forecast and order products before we know what our specific manufacturing requirements will be 
if we overestimate our product orders  our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory of completed products which we would be obligated to purchase 
this will lead to increased costs and the risk of obsolescence 
if we underestimate our product orders  our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory  which could result in delays in shipments  the loss or deferral of revenues and higher costs of sales 
it may also add costs to our products to expedite delivery of our products to customers or those components with long lead times to our contract manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to accurately forecast our product orders and may in the future carry excess or obsolete inventory  be unable to fulfill customer demand  or both  thereby harming our revenues  results of operations and customer relationships 
failure by our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products could harm our revenues  results of operations  competitive position and reputation we currently rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our products 
we may experience delays in receiving product shipments from contract manufacturers or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by effectively coordinating with our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
we do not have any long term contracts with our contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of any of our contract manufacturers would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill customer orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would harm our revenues  results of operations  competitive position and reputation 
we may not be able to expand our contract manufacturing capacity or our internal testing or quality assurance functions as required to keep up with demand for our products 
any such failure would in turn hinder our growth 
if we do not expand these capacities and functions effectively or in a timely manner  we may experience disruptions in product flow which could limit our revenues  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional cost  cancellation of orders or both 
because of intense competition for technical personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel on a cost effective basis our success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  hire  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
we plan to increase the number of our research and development  marketing  sales  customer support and operations employees 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense 
in addition  employees may leave our company and subsequently compete against us 
our failure to attract and retain these qualified employees could significantly harm our ability to develop new products and maintain customer relationships 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to 
table of contents attract and retain highly skilled employees who may look to stock options as a key component of their compensation 
the loss of the services of any of our qualified employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could hinder the development and introduction of new and enhanced products and harm our ability to sell our products 
moreover  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may be subject to such claims as we seek to retain or hire qualified personnel  some of whom may currently be working for our competitors 
some of these claims may result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us 
the loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management  technical  marketing and sales employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our key employees or that we can attract or retain additional skilled personnel as required 
failure to retain key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position 
continued rapid growth will strain our operations and require us to incur costs to maintain and upgrade our management and operational resources we have experienced and are continuing to experience a period of growth 
unless we manage our growth effectively  we may have difficulty in operating our business 
as a result  we may inaccurately forecast sales and materials requirements  fail to integrate new personnel or fail to maintain adequate internal controls  which may result in fluctuations in our operating results and cause the price of our stock to decline 
we plan to continue to expand our operations which may place a significant strain on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage our growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
if we cannot manage growth effectively  our profitability could be significantly harmed 
our products may contain defects which may cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers our existing products and any new or enhanced products we introduce may contain undetected software or hardware defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
these problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relation problems or loss of customers and reputation  all of which would harm our results of operations 
a successful claim against us for an amount exceeding the limit on our product liability insurance policy would force us to use our own resources  to the extent available  to pay the claim  which could result in an increase in our expenses and a reduction of our working capital available for other uses  thereby harming our profitability and capital resources 
our failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our results of operations and reputation our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to patent  protect and maintain our proprietary rights to our intellectual property 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws to establish and protect our intellectual property 
to date  we have relied primarily on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary processes and know how 
we have one us patent and have filed applications for additional patents in the us  japan and the european union 
we cannot be certain that any of these applications will issue into patents or that any such patents  if issued  or our existing patent will be upheld 
we also cannot be certain that our existing patent and any such additional patents  if issued  will be effective in protecting our proprietary technology 

table of contents we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our officers  employees and consultants 
we also generally limit access to and distribution of our source code and further limit the disclosure and use of our other proprietary information 
however  these measures provide only limited protection of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may not have signed agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case  and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances 
further  we have not included copyright notices on all of our copyrightable intellectual property 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of one or more competitive advantages and decreased revenues 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing trade secret  copyright  patent and trademark laws afford us only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
others may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to deter others from developing similar technologies 
further  monitoring the unauthorized use of our products and our proprietary rights is difficult 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products from time to time  other parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
we cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights 
we have not conducted a search to determine whether the technology we have in our products infringes or misappropriates intellectual property held by third parties 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which could relate to our products 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could significantly harm our results of operations 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  require us to develop alternative technology  thereby causing product shipment delays and the loss or deferral of revenues  require us to cease selling the products containing the infringing intellectual property  require us to pay substantial damage awards  damage our reputation  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents in the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our revenues  results of operations and competitive position would be harmed 
if we fail to maintain our relationships with industry experts  our products may lose industry and market recognition and sales could decline our relationships with industry experts in the field of performance analysis and measurement of networks and network equipment are critical for maintaining our industry credibility and for developing new products and testing methodologies in a timely fashion 
these experts have established standard testing methodologies that evaluate new network equipment products and technologies 
we provide these experts and their testing labs with our products and engineering assistance to perform tests on these new network equipment products and technologies 
these industry experts refer to our products in their publications which has given our products industry recognition 
in addition  these labs offer us the opportunity to test our products on the newest network equipment and technologies  thereby assisting us in developing new products that are designed to meet evolving technological needs 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our relationships with industry experts or that our competitors will not obtain similar or superior relationships with industry experts 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with industry experts  our products may lose industry and market recognition which could harm our reputation and competitive position and cause our sales to decline 
our headquarters  many of our customers and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in california where natural disasters have occurred and may occur in the future currently  our corporate headquarters  many of our customers and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in california 
california historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we and some of our customers  contract manufacturers and suppliers do not have redundant  multiple site capacity 
in the event of a natural disaster  our ability to conduct business could be significantly disrupted  thereby harming our results of operations 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefits to our shareholders our board of directors has the authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock are subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
furthermore  some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
these provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in our control despite possible benefits to our shareholders  may discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may harm the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to maintain the safety of principal and preserve liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal 
table of contents amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government debt securities  corporate debt securities and money market funds 
we do not use any derivatives or similar instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
we intend and have the ability to hold these securities to maturity and  therefore  we would not expect our consolidated operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from the levels as of december   the decline in the fair market value of the portfolio would not be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
exchange rate sensitivity the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
however  since we have sales and service operations outside of the united states  we do have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  euro  romanian lei and british pound 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  but we may do so in the future to decrease fluctuations in consolidated operating results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
