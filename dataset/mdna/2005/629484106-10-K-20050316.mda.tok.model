since january   the company s participation in the pools has been increased to 
the company formerly wrote aircraft business  but has ceased writing any new policies covering aircraft insurance for periods subsequent to march  mmo london wrote a book of ocean marine insurance through its participation in lloyd s syndicate and a book of assumed property and aircraft reinsurance through its participation in lloyd s syndicate since january   mmo london has not provided capacity to any lloyd s syndicate 
the company records premiums written in the year policies are issued and earns such premiums on a monthly pro rata basis over the terms of the respective policies 
the following tables present the company s gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for each of the past three years 
nymagic gross premiums written by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine    inland marine fire    other liability    subtotal    aircraft   mmo london total    nymagic net premiums written by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine    inland marine fire    other liability    subtotal    aircraft   mmo london total    nymagic net premiums earned by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine    inland marine fire    other liability    subtotal    aircraft   mmo london  total    unlike many types of property and casualty insurance  ocean marine  inland marine  aircraft and other liability premium rates are not strictly regulated by governmental authorities 
consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and its anticipation of positive underwriting results 
however  the insurance industry is highly competitive and the companies against which the company competes may seek to limit any market premium rate 
the property and casualty industry historically has been highly cyclical 
rates for property and casualty insurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of our control  including competition and the amount of available capital and surplus in the industry 
for example  the substantial losses in the insurance industry arising from the events of september  caused rates in the insurance industry to rise 
however  new capital has since flowed into the insurance industry 
to the extent that more capital is available  there may be downward pressure on premium rates as a result of increased supply 
these factors affecting rates for the industry in general impact the rates we are able to charge 
any significant decrease in the rates for property and casualty insurance could reduce our net income 
while rates impact our net income  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the level of rate increases or decreases and net income because other factors  such as the amount of catastrophe losses and the amount of expenses  also affect net income 
prevailing policy terms and conditions in the property and casualty insurance market are also highly cyclical 
changes in terms and conditions unfavorable to insurers  which tend to be correlated with declining rates  could further reduce our net income 
even as rates rise  the average percentage rate increases can fluctuate greatly and be difficult to predict 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include brokerage commissions and premium taxes both of which are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
acquisition costs have generally changed in proportion to changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was million or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income in compared to was primarily attributable to lower investment yields  primarily from limited partnerships  an increase in interest expense arising from the company s issuance of million of senior notes on march  and the expenses incurred by the company in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  primarily reflecting increases in net premiums earned 
net realized investment gains after taxes were  or 
per diluted share  and  or 
per diluted share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts reflect the sale of fixed income investments 
gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  increased by  and  respectively  when compared to the same period of reflecting growth in all of our core segments of business 
premiums for each segment are discussed below ocean marine gross premiums written grew by during when compared to the prior year 
the year premiums reflect an increase in cargo premium production as a result of our agreement with southern marine aviation  a leading provider of insurance for bulk petroleum cargo shipments  which commenced underwriting for the company in the fourth quarter of gross premiums in also reflect a leveling to slight decline in premium rates across all classes with the largest rate decreases occurring in the drill rig class 
the leveling of premium rates follows a few years of rate increases 
net premiums written increased by in when compared to reflecting increased gross premiums as well as higher net retentions per loss 
the company s net loss retention increased to a maximum of million for any one risk or any one occurrence effective on policies written during compared with million for any one risk or any one occurrence effective on policies written during partially offsetting the reduction in ceded written premiums in were million in reinsurance reinstatement costs incurred as a result of the hurricane ivan catastrophe loss 
there were no reinsurance reinstatement costs incurred on catastrophe losses in net premiums earned grew by in when compared to reflecting growth in premium production partially offset by reinsurance reinstatement costs 
the company cannot assure that ocean marine rates will not further decrease in inland marine fire gross premiums written increased by for the year ended december  when compared to the increase in premium writings reflect additional production from policies covering inland marine  fire  and motor truck cargo and new production sources in the surety class 
gross premiums written in reflect mildly lower market rates 
both net premiums written and net premiums earned increased and  respectively  over the comparable amounts primarily reflecting higher net loss retention levels 
other liability gross premiums written rose by for the year ended december  when compared to primarily due to premium volume increases from existing classes and new classes of business 
the growth in gross premiums written from existing classes of business was derived from the professional liability class  which rose from million in to million in as well as additional production in the contractor s liability class 
as the company commenced underwriting excess workers compensation and commercial auto insurance in the latter half of  volume increases from each of these classes of business were also achieved in gross premiums written in and for excess workers compensation were million and million  respectively  and million in commercial auto for as compared to million in premium rates in the professional liability class were flat in  however  premium rates in some of the company s other casualty classes have decreased by as much as in when compared to the same period in the leveling of premium rates follows a few years of significant rate increases 
net premiums written and net premiums earned grew by and  respectively  over the prior year due to production increases achieved in the company cannot assure that other liability rates will not further decrease in aircraft premiums decreased substantially in as a result of the company having ceased writing new aircraft policies subsequent to march  net premiums written and net premiums earned decreased in for the same reason 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned the loss ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the company recorded lower loss ratios in primarily due to a reduction in net loss reserves in the aircraft line of business of million  or of the loss ratio  relating to the events occurring on september  specifically  the loss reserves relating to the terrorist attacks of september  on the pentagon and the hijacked airliner that crashed in pennsylvania were reduced as a result of lower than expected losses 
offsetting this benefit were net catastrophe losses in the ocean marine line in arising from hurricane ivan that increased losses incurred by million and reduced net premiums earned by million due to reinsurance reinstatement costs 
there were no catastrophe losses reported in a few large current accident year losses occurring in the ocean marine line of business also contributed to a higher loss ratio in the ocean marine line in the inland marine fire loss ratios for were lower than  reflecting a lower frequency of claims and favorable loss development 
the other liability loss ratio also improved in when compared to the loss ratio in primarily due to the growth in professional liability writings and excess liability lines of business  which largely reflected the beneficial impact of firmer rates in those classes of business 
the company decreased net loss reserves by approximately million in from the year end net unpaid loss reserve amount of million 
this benefit primarily resulted from the favorable development of aircraft loss reserves  which was largely attributable to the accident year 
both ocean marine and inland marine fire also recorded favorable loss development as a result of a lower than expected emergence of losses 
the favorable results were affected by net adverse loss development of million resulting in part from provisions made for insolvent  financially impaired and commuted reinsurers  as compared to million in the results also reflect million of adverse development from the company s other liability line reflecting reserve strengthening relating to a few specific umbrella exposures stemming from asbestos losses  as compared to  in policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  were as compared with for the year ended december  the acquisition cost ratio for reflects an increase in the ocean marine ratio as a result of higher acquisition costs associated with new sources of cargo premium production and an increase in the other liability class reflecting higher acquisition costs relating to increases in the professional liability class of business 
in addition  premiums earned in reflected larger amounts of aircraft premiums  which generally have a lower acquisition cost ratio than other lines of business 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in was largely attributable to an increase in employee related expenses to service the growth in the company s business operations 
contributing to the increase in were higher administrative expenses resulting from the implementation of computer systems and sarbanes oxley related expenses 
the company s combined ratio the loss ratio plus the ratio of policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses divided by premiums earned was for the year compared with for net investment income for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  although the company maintained a larger invested asset base in than it did in as a result of favorable cash flow from operations and the proceeds received from the million of senior notes issued on march   investment yields declined in as a result of lower income from limited partnerships 
investment income  net of investment fees  from each major category of investments is as follows years ended december  in millions fixed maturities  available for sale fixed maturities  trading securities short term investments equity in earnings of limited partnerships total investment income investment expenses net investment income as of december  and investments in limited partnerships amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of the proceeds received from the million of senior notes were invested in limited partnerships 
the equity method of accounting is used to account for the company s limited partnership hedge fund investments 
under the equity method  the company records all changes in the underlying value of the limited partnership hedge fund to results of operations 
as of december  and investments in the trading portfolio amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
net investment income for and reflects approximately million and million  respectively  derived from trading portfolio activities 
these activities include the trading of collateralized debt obligations cdos and treasury notes 
the company s trading portfolio is marked to market with the change recognized in net investment income during the current period 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the sales of trading securities are also recognized in net investment income 
as a result of the accounting treatment of its limited partnerships and trading portfolio  the company s investment income results may be volatile 
as the company invests a greater percentage of its investment portfolio in limited partnership hedge funds and if the amount of trading securities held varies significantly during different periods  there may also be a greater volatility associated with the company s investment income 
commission and other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for primarily as a result of other income received from litigation and arbitration settlements 
the amounts consisted primarily of lesser amounts of income received from arbitration settlements 
larger amounts were also recorded in from reinsurance profit commissions on ocean marine business 
net realized investment gains were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  these amounts reflect the sale of fixed income investments 
write downs from other than temporary declines in the fair value of securities amounted to  and for the years ended december  and  respectively

premiums and other receivables  net increased to million as of december  from million as of december  due to increases in gross premiums written and larger balances due from the pool managed by mmo 
reinsurance receivables on paid and unpaid losses  net  amounted to million and million  respectively  as of december  as compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  paid recoverables increased in primarily due to a large loss payment made at year end 
unpaid recoverables decreased in primarily due to declines in recoverables in the runoff line of aircraft business 
other assets increased to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily as a result of deferred bond issuance costs incurred on the company s senior notes 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to declines in loss reserves in the runoff aircraft line of business largely as a result of the reduction in reserves for the terrorist attacks on september  on the pentagon and the hijacked airliner that crashed in pennsylvania 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases in loss reserves in the company s ocean marine and other liability lines of business due to increased production in reserve for unearned premiums of million as of december  increased by over the balance as of december  the percentage increase is comparable to the increase in gross premiums written from the company s core lines of business 
other liabilities increased to million as of december  from million for due in large part to increases in funds received from reinsurers and interest expense payable on the company s senior notes 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was million or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income in compared to was primarily attributable to realized investment gains and tax benefits of million  or per diluted share  resulting from the withdrawal from london operations in total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  reflecting a decline in net premiums earned from lines of business in runoff 
net realized investment gains after taxes were  or

the amounts reflected the sale of substantially all of the company s fixed income investments 
gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  declined by  and  respectively  when compared to the year ended december  as a result of the company s decisions to cease writing aircraft business and to withdraw from operations in london 
however  gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned from the company s core segments ocean marine  inland marine fire and other liability increased by  and  respectively  in over premiums for each segment are discussed below ocean marine gross premiums written grew by during when compared to the increase reflected higher ocean marine rates with the largest rate increases  approximately to  occurring in the marine liability and hull classes and additional production was achieved in the marine liability class 
other marine classes experienced a leveling in rates 
partially offsetting the overall increase were decreases in policy count in the drill rig class partly as a result of some one time builder s risk policies written in  which were not renewed in builder s risk policies may have policy terms greater than one year and accordingly their premiums are earned over the related policy periods 
in addition  we did not renew certain cargo policies in order to reduce concentrations of risk 
however  commencing in the fourth quarter of  gross premiums included approximately million of cargo premiums from our agreement with southern marine aviation  a leading provider of insurance for bulk petroleum cargo shipments 
net premiums written decreased by reflecting larger amounts of ceded reinsurance premium as a result of higher costs as well as the business mix within the various classes of ocean marine insurance 
net premiums earned grew by in compared to reflecting premium rate increases as well as increased production in the marine liability classes 
inland marine fire gross premiums written increased by for the year ended december  when compared to  largely due to the growth in the company s underwriting program insuring excess and surplus lines property risks and improved pricing 
both net premiums written and net premiums earned increased and  respectively  over the comparable amounts reflecting increases in production  pricing and higher net loss retention levels 
other liability gross premiums written rose by for the year ended december  when compared to due to production increases from existing classes and new classes commercial automobile liability and excess workers compensation and higher premium rates on policy renewals 
average rate increases achieved in were approximately to 
although additional production was achieved in the contractors liability class  policy count was reduced in the professional liability classes to mitigate exposure in certain classes of errors and omission policies 
new sources of production include underwriting a programmed book of commercial automobile liability insurance written primarily in new york area  which contributed million in gross premiums written in in addition  gross premiums written in also include million of excess workers compensation insurance  which focuses on smaller companies in the new york area 
net premiums written and net premiums earned grew by and  respectively over the prior year due to the premium rate and production increases as well as higher net loss retention levels in the contractors liability and errors and omission classes 
aircraft gross written premiums decreased in from million to million as a result of the company having ceased writing new aircraft policies subsequent to march  net premiums written and net premiums earned decreased in for the same reasons 
mmo london premiums earned were zero in  down from million in  because the company did not provide capacity to any lloyd s syndicate for the and subsequent underwriting years 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned the loss ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the company recorded lower loss ratios in in both the ocean marine and other liability lines of business  which largely reflected the absence of any catastrophe losses and the beneficial impact of increased rates in those lines of business 
net losses incurred from catastrophes in were million and in the company decreased net loss reserves by approximately million in from the year end reserve amount of million 
this benefit resulted from the favorable development of ocean marine reserves offset by the adverse development of aviation reserves attributable to accident years to and additional net loss development in its umbrella other liability losses of approximately million

the company also incurred costs with respect to the implementation of computer systems 
the company s combined ratio the loss ratio plus the ratio of policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses divided by premiums earned was for the year compared with for net investment income for the year ended december  increased by to million from million in the year ended december  the increase in reflects the implementation of our revised investment strategy  including income derived from trading portfolio activities and limited partnerships  partially offset by a lower investment yield on the fixed income portfolio in as a result of a larger position held by the company in short term investments

critical accounting policies the company discloses significant accounting policies in the notes to its financial statements 
management considers certain accounting policies to be critical for the understanding of the company s financial statements 
such policies require significant management judgment and the resulting estimates have a material effect on reported results and will vary to the extent that future events affect such estimates and cause them to differ from the estimates provided currently 
these critical accounting policies include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of investments and stock compensation 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on individual case estimates for losses reported

management reviews investments for impairment based upon specific criteria that include the duration and extent of declines in fair value of the security below its cost or amortized cost 
the company performs a qualitative and quantitative review of all securities in a loss position in order to determine if any impairment is considered to be other than temporary 
with respect to fixed income investments  declines in fair value of less than are normally considered to be temporary  unless the fixed income security has been downgraded at least two levels by a major rating agency 
additionally  the company reviews those securities held for six months or more  with fair value declines of greater than at the end of each reporting period 
the company also reviews all securities with any rating agency declines during the reporting period 
as a result of this review  the company will record an impairment charge to earnings if the fair value decline is greater than  if the fixed income security has been downgraded at least two levels by a major rating agency  or if the fair value decline is greater than and the security has been downgraded one level by a major rating agency 
this review includes considering the effect of rising interest rates and the company s intent and ability to hold impaired securities in the foreseeable future to recoup any losses 
in addition to subjecting its securities to the objective tests of percent declines in fair value and downgrades by major rating agencies  when it determines whether declines in the fair value of its securities are other than temporary  the company also considers the facts and circumstances that may have caused the declines in the value of such securities 
as to any specific security  it may consider general market conditions  changes in interest rates  adverse changes in the regulatory environment of the issuer  the duration for which the company expects to hold the security and the length of any forecasted recovery

these imbalances have been corrected mainly through improved underwriting controls  responsive management information systems and frequent review of premium rates and loss experience 
inflation also affects the final settlement costs of claims  which may not be paid for several years 
the longer a claim takes to settle  the more significant the impact of inflation on final settlement costs 
the company periodically reviews outstanding claims and adjusts reserves for the pools based on a number of factors  including inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to changes in the fair value of financial instruments  which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality  hedge fund and cdo investments 
the largest market risk to the company is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
the company considers interest rate risk and the overall duration of the company s loss reserves in evaluating the company s investment portfolio 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts dollars in millions total total there amortized fair fixed maturities after cost value tax exempts average interest rate taxables average interest rate total credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
as of december   of the fair value of the company s fixed income and short term investment portfolios were considered investment grade 
as of december   the company invested approximately million in fixed maturities that are below investment grade  with a concentration in investments rated bb by standard and poor s 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by maintaining a diversified portfolio of such securities that limits the concentration of investment in any one issuer 
the largest single investment made by the company in such securities amounted to of the total amount invested in below investment grade securities 
hedge fund risk includes the potential loss from the diminution in the value of the underlying investment of the hedge fund 
hedge fund investments are subject to various economic and market risks 
the risks associated with hedge fund investments may be substantially greater than the risks associated with fixed income investments 
consequently  our hedge fund portfolio may be more volatile  and the risk of loss greater  than that associated with fixed income investments 
as the company invests a greater percentage of its investment portfolio in limited partnership hedge funds  there may also be a greater volatility associated with the company s investment income 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries has revised its investment policy and now limits the amount of hedge fund investments to the greater of of invested assets or of policyholders surplus 
the company also seeks to mitigate market risk associated with its investments in hedge funds by maintaining a diversified portfolio of hedge fund investments 
diversification is achieved through the use of many investment managers employing a variety of different investment strategies in determining the underlying characteristics of their hedge funds 
the company is dependent upon these managers to obtain market prices for the underlying investments of the hedge funds 
some of these investments may be difficult to value and actual values may differ from reported amounts 
the hedge funds in which we invest usually impose limitations on the timing of withdrawals from the hedge funds most are within days  and may affect our liquidity 
with respect to an investment in tiptree  the company cannot withdraw funds for a minimum period of three years without the consent of the hedge fund manager 
the company invests in cdos  which are private placements 
the fair value of each security is provided by securities dealers 
the markets for these types of securities can be illiquid and  therefore  the price obtained from dealers on these securities is subject to change  depending upon the underlying market conditions of these securities  including the potential for downgrades or defaults on the underlying collateral of the security 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by maintaining a diversified portfolio of such securities that limits the concentration of investment in any one issuer 
the excess of fair value over the cost of the cdos was recorded in net investment income and amounted to  at december  the largest single investment made by the company in such securities amounted to million 
the total amount invested in cdos as of december  was million 
the company maintains an investment in a limited partnership hedge fund  tiptree  that invests in cdos  credit related structured product crs securities and other structured product securities that are structured  managed or advised by a mariner affiliated company 
this investment is consolidated in the company s financial statements 
cdos and crss are purchased by various broker dealers 
such purchases are then repackaged and sold to investors within a relatively short time period  normally within a few months 
tiptree earns a fee for servicing these arrangements and provides a margin account as collateral to secure the credit risk of the purchases made by the dealers under these agreements 
tiptree has provided million in cash as of december  to secure any purchases made by the dealers 
tiptree does not share in the gains or losses on investments held by the dealer 
management expects that only under a remote circumstance would the margin account by drawn by the dealer to secure losses 
many of the securities purchased are investment grade floating rate securities and large unrealized losses are not normally expected to occur 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by concentrating on investment grade  floating rate securities with the risk of loss being limited to the cash held in the margin accounts 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with mariner  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines  the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the company s investments
