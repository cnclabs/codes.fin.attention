table of contents overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and enclosures 
our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement  treatment  storage and enjoyment of water 
our enclosures group is a leader in the global enclosures market  designing and manufacturing standard  modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components 
in  our water group and enclosures group are forecasted to generate approximately percent and percent of total revenues  respectively 
our water segment has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from million in to approximately billion in  or approximately billion on a pro forma basis as if pentair s water acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 
the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and its large global market  of which we have identified a target industry segment totaling billion 
our vision is to become a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  treatment  storage  and enjoyment of water 
as of july   we continued the expansion of our global footprint in the water equipment industry through the acquisition of wicor  a manufacturer of pumps  filtration and pool equipment marketed primarily under the sta rite  shurflo and hypro brands 
we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with an million committed line of credit the bridge facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility 
we continue to expect to achieve million in synergies in the first full year of ownership with respect to the wicor acquisition via key initiatives including pims  material cost savings and administrative cost savings 
we also expect to achieve significant working capital reductions  fixed asset reductions  and revenue synergies from cross selling opportunities as a result of the acquisition 
we have closed or consolidated nine former wicor facilities 
we are in the process of closing or consolidating another six facilities and will complete the construction of a new water facility in mexico in the first quarter of we expect the run rate of integration benefits to begin exceeding costs by the second quarter of our enclosures segment operates in a large global market with significant headroom in industry niches such as defense  security  medical  and networking 
we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and highest brand recognition in the industry 
from mid through mid  the enclosures segment experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and over capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets 
in  sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors  new products  and higher demand in all targeted markets 
in addition  through the success of our pims and supply management initiatives  we have increased enclosures segment margins for twelve consecutive quarters 
effective after the close of business october   we completed the sale of our tools group to the black decker corporation bdk for approximately million in cash  including a million interim net asset value increase  subject to post closing adjustments 
we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and borrowings under our credit facility to repay the million bridge facility  used to acquire wicor  on october  we retained certain insurance liabilities  employee compensation and benefit liabilities  environmental liabilities  pension obligations and post retirement obligations of the tools group 
on may   our board of directors approved a for stock split in the form of a percent stock dividend payable on june   to shareholders of record as of june  all share and per share information presented in this form k has been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this stock split 

table of contents key trends and uncertainties the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and will likely impact our results in the future in  we achieved approximately percent organic sales growth  which we define as net sales excluding the effects of both acquisitions and foreign currency translation 
we plan to drive strategic growth initiatives for both our water and enclosures platforms  with particular emphasis on international growth 
we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water segment 
end user demand for pool spa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from march to july 
the magnitude of the sales spike is somewhat mitigated through effective use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs generally including extended payment terms 
demand for residential water systems are also impacted by weather patterns particularly related to droughts and heavy flooding 
we expect our water and enclosures groups to continue to benefit from our key initiatives  including supply management and pims 
we are experiencing material cost inflation in a number of our businesses 
we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as steel  resins  ocean freight and fuel  health care and insurance 
in addition  the wicor acquisition has increased our purchasing power  and we expect consolidating the water group s spending on raw materials and services to deliver savings  further cushioning the impact of material cost inflation 
free cash flow  which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures  including both continuing and discontinued operations  exceeded million for the third consecutive year and is expected to be approximately million in see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources of this report 
in  we experienced favorable foreign currency effects  primarily for the us dollar against the euro  which may not trend favorably in the future 
we expect our overall effective tax rate to be percent in as a part of our acquisition and international strategies  we are pursuing rate reduction opportunities  which could improve our effective tax rate 
we expect our water group operating income margins in each of the first two quarters of to be lower by roughly basis points compared to the prior year comparable periods 
we expect the forecasted operating income margins will be affected by the lower former wicor margins versus pentair water margins 
in the future  we intend to drive margins in the expanded water group toward a goal of percent  while capturing growth opportunities 
in  we reduced our outstanding debt by million  which was driven by strong cash flows  while completing the largest acquisition and divestiture in our history 
outlook in  our operating objectives include the following continue to drive for operating excellence lean enterprise initiatives and supply management practices  which we now collectively call pentair integrated management system pims and cash flow  complete the integration of the wicor acquisition and realize identified synergistic opportunities  continue proactive talent management process building competencies in international management and other key functional areas  achieve significant organic sales growth in excess of market growth  particularly in international markets  and continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our existing platforms in our water and enclosures segments

as of december   we had a million multi currency revolving credit facility the credit facility with various banks expiring on july  on march   we amended and restated our multi currency revolving credit facility  increasing the size of the facility from million to million with a term of five years 
the interest rate on the loans under the million credit facility is libor plus 
interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 
we are authorized to sell short term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility 
we use the credit facility as back up liquidity to support of commercial paper outstanding 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding that matured within days 
all of the commercial paper was classified as long term as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis under the credit facility 
availability under our credit facility at december   including outstanding commercial paper  was approximately million 
effective following the close of business on july   we completed the acquisition of wicor 
we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with the bridge facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility 
the interest rate on the bridge facility and loans under the credit facility during the period of the bridge facility was libor plus on october   we received approximately million of proceeds from the sale of our tools group to bdk 
as required under the terms of the bridge facility  we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and additional borrowings under the credit facility to pay off the bridge facility 
following payment of the bridge facility and based on our existing credit ratings  the interest rate on loans under the credit facility decreased to libor plus 
in addition to the credit facility  we have million of uncommitted credit facilities  under which we had no borrowings as of december  our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency current rating outlook long term debt rating standard poor s stable bbb moody s stable baa 
table of contents as a result of our announcement of an agreement to acquire wicor in february  moody s investor services confirmed the long term rating for our credit facilities of baa and changed our outlook to negative from stable 
at the same time  standard and poor s rating services placed our bbb corporate credit and other ratings on creditwatch with negative implications 
following the completion of the sale of our tools group to bdk  standard and poor s rating services affirmed our bbb corporate credit and other ratings  removed the creditwatch and changed our outlook to negative 
the change in rating outlook to negative from stable was a reflection of standard and poor s concern over integration risks associated with the acquisition of wicor and an acquisitive growth strategy 
also in february  moody s investor services placed the baa senior unsecured rating on our million notes and the baa rating on our senior notes under our million shelf registration under review for possible downgrade  due to structural subordination thereof 
existing lenders under our credit facility and private placement notes benefit from guarantees from our domestic subsidiaries  while the million senior note holders historically did not benefit from such guarantees 
in connection with the closing of the wicor acquisition  our domestic subsidiaries executed a similar guarantee for the benefit of the million senior note holders to avoid a downgrade due to this structural subordination 
on december   moody s affirmed our baa long term debt rating and changed the outlook from negative to stable 
on february   standard poor s revised our outlook to stable from negative and affirmed its bbb long term debt rating 
we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt 
a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation  a specific class of financial obligations  or a specific financial program 
the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors  insurers  or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated 
on the other hand  the ratings outlook highlights the potential direction of a short or long term rating 
it focuses on identifiable events and short term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies 
a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable 
as a result  the changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 
we issue short term commercial paper notes which are currently not rated by standard poor s or moody s 
even though our short term commercial paper is unrated  we believe a downgrade in our long term debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 
we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long term debt by either standard poor s or moody s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets 
however  depending upon market conditions  the amount  timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected 
if both of our long term debt ratings were downgraded to below bbb baa  our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 
in the event of a downgrade of our long term debt rating  the cost of borrowing and fees payable under our credit facility and million private placement fixed rate note could increase 
while the credit facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit ratings  we do not have any agreements under which the obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade 
as of december   our capital structure consisted of million in total indebtedness and  million in shareholders equity 
the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was percent  compared with percent at december  our targeted debt to total capital ratio is percent or less 
we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders 
in order to meet these cash requirements  we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

table of contents dividends paid in were million  compared with million in and million in we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity payments due by period in thousands more than years total long term debt obligations interest obligations on fixed rate debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations  net of sublease rentals purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations  net in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations  we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt 
as of december   variable interest rate debt was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases  but represent those purchases for which we are contractually obligated 
as of december   we did not have any purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of million or greater per year 
we expect to make contributions in the range of million to million to our pension plans in other financial measures in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income 
free cash flow and conversion of net income are non gaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds percent conversion of net income 
we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt 
in addition  free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation based incentives 
our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities twelve months ended december in thousands cash flow provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow net income conversion of net income in  we expect free cash flow to approximate million 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments and contingencies environmental we have been named as defendants  targets  or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups  in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status 
to date  none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs  fines  penalties  or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations 
we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases  such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in  the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in  the disposition of lincoln industrial in  and the disposition of the tools group in  we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations 
we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 
we settled one such claim in and our recorded accrual was adequate 
in addition  there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites  including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in  that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site 
we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites 
we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  for both divested and acquired businesses 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as of december  and  our reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately million and million  respectively  measured on an undiscounted basis 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 
stand by letters of credit in the ordinary course of business  predominantly for contracts and bids involving municipal pump products  we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog 
in addition  we issue financial stand by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under self insurance programs and certain legal matters 
as of december   the outstanding value of these instruments totaled million  of which million is a stand by letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal matter 
all fees and expenses are reimbursed by the indemnifying party 
as of december   the outstanding value of these instruments totaled million
