utility operations electric the company provides jurisdictional retail electric service to a large area of north central new mexico  including the cities of albuquerque and santa fe  and certain other areas of new mexico 
the largest retail electric customer served by the company accounted for approximately of the company s total retail electric revenues for the year ended december  weather normalized retail electric load growth was in the company s system peak demands for its retail customers and firm requirements customers in the summer and the winter for the last three years are shown in the following table system peak demands megawatts summer winter electric holds long term  non exclusive franchise agreements for its electric retail operations  with varying expiration dates 
these franchise agreements allow the company to access public rights of way for placement of the company s electric facilities 
franchise agreements have expired in albuquerque  santa fe  bernalillo county  sandoval county  san miguel county  village of bosque farms  pueblo de cochiti  village of tijeras  mckinley county and the city of las vegas 
the company remains obligated under new mexico state law to provide service to customers in these franchise areas despite the absence of an effective franchise agreement 
the albuquerque metropolitan area accounted for approximately of the company s total electric utility operating revenues  and no other franchise area represents more than approximately 
the company continues to collect and pay franchise fees to albuquerque and santa fe  village of bosque farms  village of tijeras and the city of las vegas 
the company currently does not pay franchise fees to bernalillo county  luna county  sandoval county  mckinley county  pueblo de cochiti or san miguel county 
gas gas distributes natural gas to most of the major communities in new mexico  including albuquerque and santa fe 
the albuquerque metropolitan area accounted for approximately of the total gas revenues in no single sales service customer accounted for more than of the company s therm sales in gas holds long term non exclusive franchises with varying expiration dates in all incorporated communities requiring franchise agreements except for municipalities of aztec  bosque farms  clayton  eunice  gallup  grants  hurley  milan  santa clara  santa fe county  and tatum 
the company remains obligated to serve these franchise areas pursuant to state law despite the absence of an effective franchise agreement 
the company s customer base includes both sales service customers and transportation service customers 
sales service customers purchase natural gas and receive transportation and delivery services from the company for which the company receives both cost of gas and cost of service revenues 
cost of gas revenues collected from sales service customers are recovered in accordance with nmprc regulations through the company s pgac and represent a pass through of the company s cost of natural gas to the customer 
therefore  the company s operating results are not affected by an increase or decrease in natural gas prices 
an order was issued by the nmprc in that approved an agreement regarding pnm s hedging strategy and the implementation of a price management fund program which includes a continuous monthly balancing account with a carrying charge 
this carrying charge has the effect of keeping pnm whole on purchases of gas since it is compensated for the time value of money that exists due to any delay in collecting 
additionally  the company makes occasional gas sales to off system sales customers 
off system sales deliveries generally occur at pipeline interconnects with the company s system and profits are shared between the company and its customers on a basis 
the company had transportation service customers in  which procure gas for their end users independently of the company s end users 
transportation service customers are gas marketers and producers contracting with the company for transportation services to their end users and for other related services that provide the company with cost of service revenues only 
transportation services are provided to transportation service customers at locations throughout the company s distribution systems  as well as points on and off the company s transmission pipelines 
the company provided gas transportation deliveries to  transportation end users during in  of the company s total gas throughput was related to transportation gas deliveries 
the company s transportation rates are unbundled  and transportation customers only pay for the service they receive 
in  revenues from transportation customers accounted for of the company s total gas revenue 
revenues from sales service customers accounted for the remaining 
of this percentage  was related to the cost of gas on which the company makes no margin 
because a major portion of the company s load is related to heating  sales levels are affected by the weather 
in  of the company s total gas sales occurred in the months of january  february  march and december 
the company obtains its supply of natural gas primarily from sources within new mexico by contracting with third party producers and marketers 
these contracts are generally sufficient to meet the company s peak day demand 
the company serves certain cities  which depend on el paso natural gas company or transwestern pipeline company  for transportation of gas supplies 
because these cities are not directly connected to the company s transmission facilities  gas transported by these companies is the sole supply source for those cities 
such transportation is regulated by the ferc 
as a result of ferc order  the company s options for transporting gas to these cities and other portions of its distribution system have increased 
transmission the company owns or leases  circuit miles of electric transmission lines  interconnected with other utilities in new mexico  east and south into texas  west into arizona  and north into colorado and utah 
due to rapid load growth in the company s service territory in recent years and the lack of transmission development  most of the capacity on this transmission system is fully committed and there is very little or no additional access available on a firm commitment basis 
these factors result in physical constraints on the system and limit the ability to wheel power into the company s service area from outside of new mexico 
wholesale operations wholesale consists of the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market based on three product lines  which are long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales 
long term contracts include sales to firm requirements and other wholesale customers with multi year arrangements 
at december   these contracts ranged from to year terms with an average term of years 
forward sales include sales in the forward market that range from month to years that are supplied by third party purchases 
these transactions do not qualify as normal sales and purchases as defined in sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas and  as a result  are marked to market 
short term sales generally include spot market  hour ahead  day ahead and week ahead contracts with terms of days or less 
also included are sales of any excess generation not required to fulfill pnm s retail load and contractual commitments 
short term sales also cover the revenue credit to retail customers as specified in the global electric agreement see note commitments and contingencies global electric agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the wholesale strategy calls for increased net asset backed energy sales supported by long term contracts in the wholesale market  where the company s aggregate net open forward electric sales position  including short term sales  forward sales and long term contracts  is covered by its forecasted excess generation capacity 
management actively monitors the net asset backed sales by the use of stringent risk management policies 
the company s future growth plans call for approximately of its new generation portfolio to be committed through long term contracts 
the threshold is in compliance with the global electric agreement 
growth will be dependent on market development and on the company s ability to generate funds for the company s future expansion 
the company continues to operate in the wholesale market and seek appropriately priced asset additions 
expansion of the company s generating portfolio will depend on the company s ability to acquire favorably priced assets at strategic locations and to secure long term commitments for the purchase of power from the acquired plants 
power sales in  the company s revenues from the wholesale marketplace stabilized following the preceding years when volatility was high 
during  power prices declined significantly due to lower natural gas prices  an average pacific northwest hydro generation year  an increase in new generation coming on line  and a shift by various large california utilities to long term contracts rather than spot market purchases 
in  the trend experienced in continued  except that power prices were generally higher due primarily to higher natural gas prices and abnormally hot summer temperatures in the southwestern united states 
the company has been successful in developing its wholesale power marketing activities in the western united states  even in times of market volatility 
management believes this success is due to its niche business strategy of providing electric power customized to meet the special needs of its customers 
this niche marketing strategy is based on the company s net asset backed methodology  which can help to mitigate the risks inherent in the company s wholesale power marketing activities 
the company also utilizes long term transactions to enhance its product offerings 
certain company generation resources are excluded from retail electric rates 
as a result  the company developed a wholesale power marketing strategy to sell the generation from its resources that are excluded from retail rates 
this strategy also includes the forward purchase and sale of electricity to take advantage of market price opportunities in the electric wholesale market 
during  and  the company s sales in the wholesale electric markets accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of its total mwh sales 
of the total wholesale electric sales made in  and   and  respectively  were transacted through purchases for resale 
see item properties 
in  the nmprc established an off system sales methodology that provided for a sharing mechanism whereby a certain amount of revenues from off system sales were credited to reduce retail cost of service 
off system sales above the amounts credited to retail customers accrue to the benefit of shareholders 
subsequent rate cases have continued to utilize this methodology 
in  the nmprc approved the global electric agreement that set a rate path through pnm agreed to decrease retail electric rates by in two phases over three years 
the first phase of the rate reductions became effective in september the second phase will become effective september  see note commitments and contingencies global electric agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has entered into various firm wholesale electric sales contracts 
these contracts contain fixed capacity charges in addition to energy charges 
capacity charges are fixed monthly payments for a commitment of resources to service the contract requirements 
energy charges are payments based on the amount of electricity delivered to the customer intended to compensate the company for its variable costs incurred to provide the energy 
the company s firm requirements demand was mw in  and is expected  based solely on existing contracts  to be mw in  mw in  mw in and mw in no firm requirements wholesale customer accounted for more than of the company s total electric sales for resale revenues for the year ended december  corporate and other on december   the holding company became a registered holding company under puhca 
as a result of the requirement to register as a holding company  the holding company created pnmr services company  a services company  which began operation on january   subject to final approval of a services company application filed with the sec in january the holding company performed substantially all of the corporate activities of pnm from to these activities were billed to pnm on a cost basis to the extent they were for the corporate management of pnm and were allocated to the operating segments 
the services functions previously performed by the holding company have been assumed by pnmr services company effective january  sources of power the company has sources of power from property it owns or leases and power purchased by the company through various long term ppas 
for the year ended december   the company had a  mw generation capacity from these sources 
sources of power owned as of december   the total net generation capacity of facilities owned by the company was  mw  which includes all of pvngs  portions of which are leased 
see item properties 
the company is committed to increasing the utilization of its generation capacity at sjgs  four corners and pvngs 
sjgs is operated by the company 
sjgs s equivalent availability and capacity factors were and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to and  respectively  for capacity factors for four corners and pvngs were and  respectively  in  as compared to and  respectively  in four corners and pvngs are operated by aps 
the company s lordsburg and afton plants were built to serve wholesale customers and other sales rather than new mexico retail customers and  therefore  are not currently included in the retail rates 
however  it is possible that these plants may be needed in the future to serve the growing retail load 
if so  these plants would have to be certified by the nmprc and would then be subject to inclusion in the company s retail rates in a future rate case 
these plants were built in furtherance of the company s ongoing strategy of increasing generation capacity over time to serve increasing retail load  sales under long term contracts and other sales 
the plants owned by the company are available through joint dispatch to support service to the retail customers of pnm 
in november  the company purchased a one third interest in a partially constructed  combined cycle power plant near deming  new mexico  called luna 
the facility is expected to be completed in summer and is designed to be capable of producing mw of which the company will be entitled to mw 
sources of power leased in  the company entered into an operating lease agreement for the rights to all the output of the delta gas fired generating plant for years 
the plant received ferc approval for exempt wholesale generator status 
the maximum dependable capacity under the lease is mw 
the gas turbine generating unit is operated by delta and is located on the company s retired person generating station site in albuquerque 
primary fuel for the gas turbine generating unit is natural gas provided by wholesale gas purchases 
in addition  the unit has the capability to utilize low sulfur fuel oil if natural gas is neither available nor cost effective 
as discussed above  the company leases portions of pvngs 
see item properties and note lease commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sources of power ppas in addition to generating its own power  the company purchases power in the open market 
the company s sales under its long term ppas  including the delta lease and the contract described below  were mw in and are expected to be mw in  mw in  mw in  and mw in this projected capacity assumes that contracts that end during the period are not renewed or extended 
the company also purchases power in the forward  day ahead and real time markets 
in  the company entered into an agreement with fpl to develop a mw wind generation facility in new mexico 
the company began receiving commercial power from the project in june fpl owns and operates the new mexico wind energy center  which consists of wind powered turbines on a site in eastern new mexico 
the company has a contract to purchase all the power generated by the new mexico wind energy center for years 
in  the company received approval from the nmprc for a voluntary tariff that allows pnm retail customers to buy wind generated electricity for a small monthly premium 
power from the new mexico wind energy center is used to service load under the voluntary tariff and as part of the company s electric supply mix for meeting retail load 
any wind generated electricity in excess of these amounts is sold on the wholesale power market  either within new mexico or outside the state 
market reach the company owns firm transmission capacity to the mead market hub in the amount of mw  which serves various wholesale power markets and loads in the greater las vegas  nevada area  and serves as a delivery point for the california iso 
in addition  the company owns transmission capacity to serve major load centers in the phoenix  arizona area in the amount of mw 
fuel and water supply the percentages of the company s generation of electricity on the basis of kwh fueled by coal  nuclear fuel and gas and oil  and the average costs to the company of those fuels in cents per million btu  during the past three years were as follows coal nuclear gas and oil percent of average percent of average percent of average generation cost generation cost generation cost the generation mix for is expected to be coal  nuclear and gas and oil 
due to locally available natural gas and oil supplies  the utilization of locally available coal deposits and the generally abundant supply of nuclear fuel  the company believes that adequate sources of fuel are available for its generating stations into the foreseeable future 
coal see note commitments and contingencies coal supply in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
natural gas the natural gas used as fuel for the electric generating plants located in albuquerque reeves station and the delta operating lease is procured on the open market and delivered by gas through its transportation services 
wholesale procures its gas supply independently of gas but obtains gas transportation services from gas 
nuclear fuel the company is one of several participants in pvngs 
see note construction program and jointly owned plants in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fuel cycle for pvngs is comprised of the following stages mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride  fabrication of fuel assemblies  utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors  and storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
the pvngs participants have contracted for all of pvngs requirements for uranium  uranium concentrates and conversion services through the pvngs participants have also contracted for all of pvngs enrichment services through and fuel assembly fabrication services until at least water supply see note commitments and contingencies water supply in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
rates and regulation pnm is subject to the jurisdiction of the nmprc  with respect to its retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities  construction of major new generation and transmission facilities and other matters regarding retail utility services provided in new mexico 
the ferc has jurisdiction over rates and other matters related to wholesale electric sales and cost recovery for a portion of its transmission network 
the company is also subject to regulation under puhca 
electric rates and regulation ferc regional transmission organizations with the passage of the public utility regulatory policies act of and the energy policy act of  there has been a significant increase in the level of competition in the market for the generation and sale of electricity 
barriers have been reduced for companies wishing to build  own and operate electric generating facilities 
in  the ferc issued order requiring electric utilities controlling transmission facilities to file open access transmission tariffs  which opened the utility transmission systems to wholesale sellers and buyers of electric energy on a non discriminatory basis 
order also encouraged utilities to investigate the formation of isos to operate transmission assets and provided guidance for the formation  operation and governance of isos 
in  the ferc issued order on rtos  which established timelines for transmission owning entities to join an rto and defined the minimum characteristics and functions of an rto 
in  pnm  together with other ferc jurisdictional utilities in the southwest  filed a request with the ferc seeking approval of a proposed for profit transmission company named westconnect to meet the criteria of order the proposal  recently revised in  remains under review at the ferc 
in  the ferc issued a nopr  which if approved  would modify order by instituting a standard market design for electric wholesale markets 
prior to any final action on the standard market design proposal  the ferc issued a policy white paper in that modified several provisions of the original standard market design proposal and stated that if it were demonstrated that the costs of implementing any feature of the standard market design outweighed its benefits  the ferc would not require the rto to implement that feature 
acting upon the direction of the white paper  the westconnect participants are currently pursuing a phased approach to implementing the wholesale market improvements that would otherwise be performed by an rto 
the westconnect participants executed a new memorandum of understanding in december  in which participants will continue to explore market enhancement initiatives designed to enhance wholesale market competition in the southwest 
uncertainty continues to exist regarding the ferc s evolving rto policy 
the ferc has not set a schedule for additional proceedings involving the standard market design issues 
pnm  together with the westconnect participants  is continuing to monitor the various regulatory activities while continuing to explore opportunities for implementing cost effective enhancements to the wholesale market pursuant to the current westconnect memorandum of understanding 
ferc rule making over the past several years  the ferc has issued numerous rules that have impacted the wholesale energy business 
the ferc is attempting to remedy what it sees as undue discrimination in the provision of interstate transmission services and to ensure just and reasonable rates for electric energy within and among regional power markets 
a proposed rule would put all transmission customers  including bundled retail customers  under new pro forma transmission rates for new transmission service 
independent transmission providers  eg  isos and rtos  would provide all transmission service and congestion would be managed using marginal pricing structures 
see regional transmission organization above for further discussion 
in addition  the ferc has issued final rules that have an impact on the wholesale energy business and participants in the wholesale energy markets  including pnm 
in august  the ferc issued order  which requires electric utilities that own or control electric transmission facilities to set out standard procedures and a standard agreement for interconnecting generators larger than mw  and to make such revisions as necessary to its open access transmission tariff to comply with the requirements of the new rule 
pnm made its compliance filing in january and  in september  pnm received notice that its revised tariff filing was accepted by the ferc 
in december  the ferc issued order b  which provided additional clarification on certain matters 
pnm joined an industry group requesting rehearing of order b  and also separately filed its petition for rehearing order b 
the ferc issued its final rule adopting standards of conduct for electric and natural gas transmission providers  known as order the final rule expands on the ferc s prior orders establishing standards of conduct and combines the prior electric and natural gas standards so that there is now one standard for both electric and natural gas transmission providers 
the revised standards of conduct generally continue the requirement of transmission providers  including pnm  to treat all transmission customers  affiliated or non affiliated  on a non discriminatory basis  and prohibits transmission providers from operating their system to preferentially benefit an energy or marketing affiliate 
the rule became effective in february  and required compliance by june  pnm made the required initial compliance filing stating that it is in substantial compliance with order the ferc issued its revised order a  which required that the training of employees be completed and compliance with provisions of the revised rule by september  the ferc issued order b  which required compliance with the standards of conduct rule  including training of employees  by september  pnm implemented compliance measures  including completion of the training of employees  by the compliance deadlines 
in  in a set of cases not involving pnm  the ferc announced a new supply margin assessment screen to determine if applicants for market based rate authority could potentially exercise horizontal generation based market power 
for those applicants that failed the supply margin assessment screen  the ferc would deny the market based rate application or condition its approval with certain mitigation requirements to address the market power concern 
in april  the ferc announced the establishment of a new interim two pronged market power screen to be applied in market based rate cases 
in may  the ferc issued procedural orders in pending market based rate application renewal cases  including pnm s case  requiring the use of the new two pronged interim screen and requiring pnm to make its revised market based rate filing by august in july  the ferc issued an order affirming its interim two pronged market screen test 
pnm filed its triennial market power screen analyses in august utilizing the new two pronged interim screen as required by the ferc s order 
in its filing  pnm noted that it continued to face historical transmission constraints in northern new mexico and would continue to abide by the cost based rate limitation on transmission service during times of transmission constraints for the northern new mexico market 
pnm also noted that for the epe control area  pnm s wholesale market share screen was slightly above during two seasons 
in october  pnm made a supplemental filing utilizing more detailed load and generation data contained in epe s market power screen filing  which resulted in pnm having a revised wholesale market share result below for all seasons 
in december  the ferc issued its order in pnm s market based rate filing finding that the ferc is initiating a proceeding to determine if pnm s mitigation measure in northern new mexico is sufficiently adequate to prevent the exercise of market power 
the ferc s order also required additional explanation of pnm s revised wholesale market share calculation 
pnm filed a petition for rehearing contesting the ferc s findings regarding the epe control area  and arguing that pnm lacks generation market power in northern new mexico given the transmission access available to transmission customers in that market and the pre existing mitigation measure that ferc previously approved in the ferc also established that rates reviewed under this proceeding for transactions completed in these two markets would be subject to refund effective march  in february  pnm made its revised filing  in which the company s expert presented various revised screen analyses for the epe control area and concluded that the ferc should continue to permit pnm to make sales at market based rates in that control area 
the analyses show that the screen failures disappear when the input data reflect the realities of economic and physical conditions in the southern new mexico market 
the evidence presented concluded the screen failure scenarios do not warrant the conclusion that pnm possesses generation market power in epe s control area 
the company s expert further concluded that the ferc should continue to permit pnm to make sales at market based rates in pnm s northern new mexico control area  subject to the existing mitigation provision contained in pnm s market based sales tariff 
he concluded pnm does not have the potential to exercise generation market power because customers enjoy access to robust markets during the hours that concerned the ferc  and given that the pre existing mitigation would prevent any exercise of generation market power in the event of transmission constraints 
the company s expert also concluded that  if the ferc determines that pnm should not be permitted to sell at market based rates in its northern new mexico control area  the ferc nevertheless should permit pnm to sell at market based rates at san juan because san juan is outside the transmission constraint path 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings on the company s financial position or results of operations  however  should ferc determine that pnm has generation market power in these two markets  pnm could continue to make sales at cost based rates and thus not have revenues subject to refund in this matter 
nmprc global electric agreement in october  pnm entered into a global electric agreement wherein it committed as part of a five year plan to reduce retail electric rates by in two phases a reduction  which became effective on september   and a reduction  which will become effective on september  
the global electric agreement was approved by the nmprc in january while beneficial to pnm s retail electric customers  pnm also benefits from the rate certainty the global electric agreement provides through the end of and several other key components 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations global electric agreement and note commitments and contingencies global electric agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
renewable resources rule making the nmprc issued a renewable resources rule in to encourage the development of renewable energy in new mexico 
the rule includes a provision requiring the use of a minimum of renewable energy by january   with the minimum amount to increase per year for each year until a renewable portfolio standard of is reached in the year the renewable energy act passed by the new mexico legislature establishes a mandatory renewable energy portfolio standard similar to the structure established by the nmprc 
the renewable energy act provides for streamlined proceedings for utilities to obtain approval of procurement plans  provided certainty to utilities and protection for customers and required the nmprc to establish a reasonable cost threshold for the procurement of renewable energy to prevent excessive costs being added to rates 
under the renewable energy act  if renewable energy cannot be acquired under the threshold  the mandate would be suspended 
in july  pnm made its annual portfolio summary filing as required under the renewable resources rule and the renewable energy act 
in september  pnm made its renewable energy procurement plan filing  outlining its plan to use renewable energy certificates acquired during to meet the renewable portfolio standard beginning in pnm entered into a stipulation with the nmprc staff and other parties which provided that pnm met the diversity requirements of the renewable energy act  and which provided that expenditures up to  associated with assessment of biomass projects in were reasonable and recoverable in the next general electric rate case 
the stipulation also provided that expenditures up to  associated with the implementation of a solar photovoltaic program were also reasonable and recoverable 
the nmprc approved the stipulation in december in december  the nmprc issued an order  subject to nmprc review in  that established a reasonable cost threshold for renewable energy resources  beyond which a utility is relieved from the requirement to add renewable energy resources to its portfolio 
the order provides that an overall rate increase of no more than in  no more than an additional per year until capped at for each year beginning in and beyond 
reasonable cost threshold amounts were also set for each resource 
environmental matters pnm  in common with other electric and gas utilities  is subject to stringent laws and regulations for protection of the environment by local  state  federal and tribal authorities 
in addition  pvngs is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc  which has the authority to issue permits and licenses and to regulate nuclear facilities in order to protect the health and safety of the public from radioactive hazards and to conduct environmental reviews pursuant to the national environmental policy act

throughout the terms of the leases  the company continues to have full and exclusive authority and responsibility to exercise and perform all of the rights and duties of a participant in pvngs under the arizona nuclear power project participation agreement and retains the exclusive right to sell and dispose of its share of the power and energy generated by pvngs units and the company also retains its responsibility to pay its share of all taxes  insurance premiums  operating and maintenance costs  costs related to capital improvements and decommissioning and all other similar costs and expenses associated with the leased facilities 
in  the company purchased of the beneficial interests in the pvngs units and leases through the purchase of ownership interest in the trusts which held the leases 
the related ownership interests were subsequently reacquired by the company when the company s trust ownership was collapsed and the company assumed direct ownership 
each lease describes certain events  events of loss or deemed loss events  the occurrence of which could require the company to  among other things  i pay the lessor and the equity investor  in return for the investor s interest in pvngs  cash in the amount provided in the lease and ii assume debt obligations relating to the pvngs lease 
the events of loss generally relate to casualties  accidents and other events at pvngs  which would severely  adversely affect the ability of the operating agent  aps  to operate  and the ability of the company to earn a return on its interests in  pvngs 
the deemed loss events consist mostly of legal and regulatory changes such as changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal  or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations 
the company believes that the probability of such events of loss or deemed loss events occurring is remote for the following reasons i to a large extent  prevention of events of loss and some deemed loss events is within the control of the pvngs participants  including the company  and the pvngs operating agent  through the general pvngs operational and safety oversight process and ii with respect to other deemed loss events  which would involve a significant change in current law and policy  the company is unaware of any pending proposals or proposals being considered for introduction in congress  or in any state legislative or regulatory body that  if adopted  would cause any of those events

currently  the business of pnm constitutes substantially all of the business of the holding company 
therefore  the historical results of operations of pnm are virtually identical to the consolidated results of the holding company and all its subsidiaries 
for discussion purposes  this report will use the term company when discussing matters of common applicability to the holding company and subsidiaries and pnm 
readers of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should assume that the information presented applies to consolidated results of operations of both the holding company and its subsidiaries  including pnm  except where the context or references clearly indicate otherwise 
discussions regarding specific contractual obligations generally reference the company that is legally obligated 
in the case of contractual obligations of pnm  these obligations are consolidated with the holding company and its subsidiaries under gaap 
broader operational discussions refer to the company 
the holding company was established as the holding company in and was exempt from regulation under puhca 
in april  however  the sec staff informed pnm resources inc that  because of an sec ruling in  the level of interstate power sales by pnm did not allow the holding company to continue to claim exemption from registration 
on december   the holding company became a registered holding company under puhca 
the holding company also created a new subsidiary called pnmr services company  which began operating on january   subject to final approval by the sec 
the holding company performed substantially all of the corporate activities of pnm from to these activities were billed to pnm on a cost basis to the extent they were for the corporate management of pnm and are allocated to the operating segments 
the services functions previously performed by the holding company have been assumed by pnmr services company effective january  the holding company is an investor owned holding company of energy and energy related companies 
its principal subsidiary  pnm  is an integrated public utility primarily engaged  within the state of new mexico  in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity  transmission  distribution and sale of natural gas  and the sale and marketing of electricity in the western united states 
the company s vision is to build america s best merchant utility 
the company views a merchant utility as the balanced combination of a strong regulated utility with growth oriented electric sales in competitive markets 
the company is positioned as a merchant utility  primarily operating as a regulated energy service provider 
the company is also engaged in the sale and marketing of electricity in the competitive wholesale energy marketplace 
as a utility  pnm has an obligation to serve its customers under the jurisdiction of the nmprc 
as a wholesale electricity provider  pnm markets excess production from the utility  as well as unregulated generation  into a competitive marketplace 
as part of its electric wholesale power operation  it purchases wholesale electricity in the open market for future resale or to provide energy to retail customers in new mexico when the company s generation assets cannot satisfy demand 
the wholesale operations utilize a net asset backed strategy  whereby the company s aggregate net open position for the sale of electricity is covered by the company s forecasted excess generation capabilities 
as it currently operates  the company s principal business segments  whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s management  are utility operations and wholesale operations 
utility operations include electric  gas and transmission 
these segments model the resource allocations as mandated in the global electric agreement see note commitments and contingencies global electric agreement  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
electric consists of the distribution and generation of electricity for retail electric customers in new mexico 
gas includes the transportation and distribution of natural gas to end users 
transmission consists of the transmission of electricity to third parties as well as to electric and wholesale 
wholesale consists of the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market based on three product lines that include long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales 
the utility operations strategy is directed at supplying reasonably priced and reliable energy to retail customers through customer driven operational excellence  high quality customer service  cost efficient processes  and improved overall organizational performance 
the wholesale operations strategy calls for increased net asset backed energy sales supported by long term contracts into the wholesale market  whereby the company s aggregate net open forward electric sales position  including short term sales  forward sales and long term contracts  is covered by its forecasted excess generation capacity 
management actively monitors the net asset backed sales by the use of stringent risk management policies 
the company s future growth plans call for approximately of its new generation portfolio to be committed through long term contracts as required by the global electric agreement 
growth will be dependent on market development and on the company s ability to generate funds for the company s future expansion 
the company will continue to operate in the wholesale market and seek reasonably priced asset additions 
expansion of the company s generating portfolio will depend on the company s ability to acquire favorably priced assets at strategic locations and to secure long term commitments for the purchase of power from the acquired plants 
the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and the significant factors affecting the results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known 
refer to disclosure regarding forward looking statements and risk factors at the end of this item competitive strategy the company s vision is to build america s best merchant utility 
to achieve this objective  management intends to grow regulated and unregulated operations 
the company intends to grow both its retail and wholesale business by expanding its current operations and by acquiring additional value enhancing assets 
as evidenced by the luna acquisition and the proposed tnp acquisition  the company intends to continue to grow its revenues by expanding its geographic coverage in the southwest  a region which not only exhibits rapid customer and load growth  but which the company knows well 
the company plans to focus on best practices in integrating its acquisitions to create a stronger presence in the southwest market 
the company also intends to increase its presence in the southwest market by buying additional generating resources and selling power from those resources through long term contracts 
in addition  the company expects that the acquisition of first choice power as part of the proposed tnp acquisition  as discussed below  will provide a solid foundation for entry into the competitive retail market in texas 
acquire additional generating assets in the southwest region 
the company intends to enhance and diversify its presence in the southwest region through the acquisition of quality generation assets to serve the company s retail and wholesale load while maintaining diversity of fuel mix 
the company plans to increase long term sales contracts in tandem with increases in its generation capacity 
the company expects to do this through the addition of gas fired generation plants and the acquisition of coal fired facilities  the acquisition or development of renewable or clean technology resources and or the use of long term purchase contracts for power 
as in the past  the company intends to continue a disciplined approach to any acquisition  to match acquisitions to demand and to hedge capacity with long term contracts 
maintain prudent cost controls 
management continues to maintain cost control procedures and expects to implement similar control procedures at tnp once the acquisition is complete 
as a result of pnm s coal contract  the company s fuels group has also been able to hedge the company s exposure to coal prices at the sjcc for the next years  which the company believes will help it improve or maintain gross margins if coal costs rise 
continue to improve credit strength and reduce cost of capital 
a high priority and long term commitment is to maintain the company s investment grade rating in any type of regulatory or commodity price scenario 
the company believes tnp offers an opportunity to derive additional value through the stronger credit profile of the combined entity 
since december   the company has reduced its weighted average cost of long term debt from to 
in addition  as discussed below  the company expects to reduce tnp s current financing costs by at least million annually  on a pre tax basis  through the refinancing of tnp s relatively high cost capital 
commitment to corporate citizenship 
the company is committed to its guiding principle  do the right thing 
this commitment serves as the cornerstone of the company s ethics and compliance efforts and underscores its effort to ensure that dealings with customers  employees  shareholders and business partners are above reproach 
this is evidenced by the company s environmental sustainability program with aggressive five year goals for reducing water usage  improving air quality  reducing waste streams and becoming a leader in the development of renewable energy 
acquisitions proposed acquisition of tnp 
on july   the company announced the proposed billion acquisition of tnp  including its principal subsidiaries  tnmp and first choice power 
the company expects the proposed tnp acquisition to be accretive to its earnings and free cash flow in the first full year after closing 
tnp is the privately owned holding company of tnmp and first choice power 
tnmp provides transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers in texas competitive electricity market  composed of approximately  retail customers in texas and approximately  in new mexico 
first choice power is one of the state s retail electric providers with approximately  retail customers in texas 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals  including the nmprc  the puct  the sec under the puhca and the ferc 
no shareholder approval is required for the acquisition 
the holding company believes at this time that all conditions precedent to closing  including final resolution of regulatory proceedings  can be met so that closing can occur in the second quarter of the company will lead the integration efforts and implementation of the transition plan that will be executed upon receiving regulatory approvals 
the company expects to close the proposed tnp acquisition in the second quarter of the company believes that the proposed tnp acquisition is consistent with its strategic plan of balancing stable and predictable revenue streams with prudent and measured growth opportunities 
upon the consummation of the proposed tnp acquisition  the company will serve approximately million customers  with  electric customers and  gas customers 
of the electric customers  approximately  will be price to beat customers in texas and  will be retail customers in texas 
the company believes tnmp s utility operations will provide an additional stable source of revenue and cash flow 
the proposed tnp acquisition will strengthen the company s position as a leading energy provider in the growing southwest region  providing market  customer and regulatory diversity 
in addition  the company expects first choice power s established retail customer base and operations  when combined with the company s generation source hedging  financial strength and power marketing expertise  to present additional potential to improve margins and increase market penetration in texas 
the combined company is expected to have consolidated revenues of over billion and would serve a number of growing communities  including albuquerque  santa fe  and alamogordo in new mexico  as well as suburban areas around dallas fort worth  houston  and galveston in texas 
through first choice  the holding company will also serve customers in communities throughout the ercot region 
under the terms of the agreement  tnp s common shareholders will receive approximately million in consideration  consisting of approximately million newly issued holding company common shares and the remainder being paid in cash  subject to closing adjustments 
the existing indebtedness and preferred securities at tnp will be retired 
all debt at tnmp will remain outstanding 
based on the number of common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis and taking into account additional equity issuances  following the transaction  the holding company s shareholders would own of the combined company s common equity  and tnp s shareholders would own 
in order to fund the acquisition and to deleverage tnp  the holding company expects to issue between million and million of common equity  million and million of equity linked securities  and million of long term debt 
as a result of discussions with the rating agencies pursuant to their ratings evaluation services  the company believes that the acquisition financing initially proposed will not result in any credit rating changes for the holding company or pnm 
the company continues to work with the ratings agencies to further optimize the equity equity linked mix and maintain its current ratings 
of the total of million of common equity and equity linked securities  approximately million of common stock will be issued to tnp s shareholders  and the holding company has executed a unit purchase agreement  the agreement  for purposes of this discussion  with an existing shareholder  cascade  to purchase million in equity linked securities 
the holding company had originally disclosed its intent to issue million of debt at eight percent interest 
the holding company since has entered into a million notional floating to fixed interest rate swap that effectively locks the interest at through november in addition  the holding company achieved a interest rate on equity linked securities to be issued to cascade 
an additional million of equity linked securities will be issued concurrently with the tnp financing to fund the construction of luna see acquisition of luna below 
in september  the board adopted a resolution approving the terms of the holding company s agreement with cascade  which calls for the holding company  upon the request of cascade and subject to the receipt of any necessary approvals from the sec  to propose to its shareholders at the annual meeting an amendment to the holding company s restated articles of incorporation 
the amendment would enable the holding company to confer upon holders of preferred stock issued under the agreement  voting as a single class with holders of common stock  the same number of votes to which the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible on all matters other than the election of directors of the holding company 
there is a limit on the aggregate amount of preferred stock outstanding with such voting rights 
the limit is such that outstanding preferred stock with such voting rights may be convertible to no more than million shares of common stock 
shareholder approval is not a condition of the acquisition transaction 
on september   the holding company and tnmp filed joint applications with the nmprc and the puct 
the application filed with the nmprc seeks approval of the acquisition of the stock of tnp by the holding company pursuant to the new mexico public utility act 
the hearing examiner has scheduled hearings to commence on march   regarding the merits of the joint application 
the holding company has entered into negotiations with new mexico parties in an effort to develop an agreement that would be presented to state regulators 
the application filed with the puct seeks a determination that the acquisition is in the public interest pursuant to the texas public utility regulatory act 
the puct referred the case to the texas state office of administrative hearings  which assigned an alj 
the puct has ruled that the case does not constitute a rate case under texas law 
on february   the holding company announced that it had reached an agreement in texas that represents a significant next step in the process of completing its acquisition of tnp 
the settlement agreement is between the holding company and tnmp  the cities of dickenson  lewisville  la marque  ft 
stockton and friendswood  texas  the legal and enforcement division of the puct  the office of public utility counsel  the texas industrial energy consumers and the alliance for retail markets 
the settlement agreement outlines terms and conditions necessary for the puct to find the acquisition of tnp and its subsidiaries  tnmp and first choice power  to be in the public interest 
the company believes the puct will approve the agreement  although no assurances can be given regarding the approval 
among other issues  the settlement agreement calls for a two year electric rate freeze that includes a million annual rate reduction in tnmp s retail delivery rates effective may   an authorized return on equity of on an implied capital structure of debt and equity for certain reporting purposes  the use of a debt equity capital structure in tnmp s next base rate case if filed before january   and a million synergy savings credit amortized over months effective after the close of the transaction 
on january   epe filed a motion to intervene and protest with the ferc 
epe alleged that the holding company and tnmp did not provide sufficient analysis to determine if there were anti competitive effects from the transaction and conditionally requested that the ferc schedule a hearing pending receipt of the analyses epe alleged is required 
on february   the holding company and tnmp filed a joint motion seeking leave to file an answer  attaching the answer which contends that the application contains sufficient information required by the ferc for a transmission only acquisition and that epe s allegations are speculative and unsubstantiated 
the answer requests denial of the protest and approval of the transaction as requested in the application 
on february   the ferc issued a notice of meeting for march   which includes the application as a matter to be considered 
on february   the holding company was notified that the proposed acquisition of tnp had received anti trust clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of from the federal trade commission 
on february   the holding company announced that it reached an agreement in new mexico that represents another significant step in the process for completing its acquisition of tnp 
the unopposed stipulation was signed by the holding company  tnmp  the nmprc staff  the new mexico state attorney general s office and the new mexico industrial energy consumers 
the stipulation must be approved by the nmprc 
among other issues  the stipulation provides tnmp s  electric customers in southern new mexico with a three phase rate reduction totaling  beginning january and ending december the rate reduction  which includes tnmp s annual synergy savings allocation of  will lower tnmp electric rates by million in the first year 
allows tnmp an imputed debt equity structure with an assumed rate of return on equity of 
maintains pnm as the power supplier for tnmp s new mexico needs through calls for the integration of tnmp s new mexico assets into pnm effective january  the companies  however  will maintain separate rates through the stipulation also provides resolution on how consolidation savings  or synergy savings  will be allocated among pnm gas and electric customers 
according to the stipulation pnm s  electric customers will receive rate credits totaling million or nearly million annually over a month period beginning january pnm s  gas customers will receive million in rate credits over the next five years  or  annually  beginning at the close of the acquisition 
the transaction may be terminated under certain circumstances described in the agreement  including the failure to close by december  acquisition of luna 
on november   the company purchased a one third interest in a partially constructed  combined cycle power plant near deming  new mexico  called luna 
the facility is expected to be completed in summer and is designed to be capable of producing mw  of which the company will be entitled to mw 
two other equal co purchasers along with the company paid a combined million for luna and will invest an aggregate of million to complete construction 
construction was suspended in when the plant was complete 
the company will manage the plant s construction and operation once completed 
in keeping with the company s environmental sustainability program and the conditions of luna s permits  the company intends to use treated effluent water from the city of deming to reduce the plant s use of fresh water by one third and to install a selective catalytic reduction system to dramatically reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide 
the company also believes that luna strategically fits well into its portfolio of generation assets because of the facility s location in southern new mexico  its low capital costs  its efficient heat rate  its anticipated low dispatch costs and its use of clean burning gas technology 
the company anticipates that the plant will be jointly dispatched as part of pnm s overall generation portfolio 
overall outlook earnings growth in was primarily due to strong growth in the company s electric and gas utility  coupled with reduced interest costs from debt refinancing and the positive effect of the gas rate increase  which went into full effect in april other factors that contributed to the increase in earnings during included lower coal costs  improved coal quality  strong fourth quarter gas revenues  improved availability of sjgs and continued cost control measures throughout the company 
these positive factors more than offset the impact of the retail electric rate reduction that went into effect in september wholesale operating revenues increased million  or  in over the prior year period primarily due to additional long term contract sales and wholesale electric price improvements 
these new contracts support the company s long term growth plans and net asset backed strategy 
in addition  the company s short term sales increased over the prior year period  partially due to an increase in average short term prices 
additionally  short term sales volume increased as more favorable day ahead market spreads shifted volume from forward sales due to less favorable market spreads between pvngs and the mead market hub 
however  wholesale gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold and intersegment energy transfer  decreased million  or 
the decrease reflected higher purchase power prices  the effect of less available excess energy resulting from increased electric retail load growth and unplanned outages on certain of the company s generation facilities 
operating revenues for electric decreased million  or  in from the prior year 
the decrease in revenues was due to an electric rate reduction  which decreased revenues by million 
the company reduced its retail rates based on an electric rate agreement that took effect in september  under the agreement  rates will decrease again by in september and remain at that level through retail electricity sales grew  to million mwh in compared to million mwh in weather normalized retail electric load growth was in this volume increase was due to customer growth  which increased revenues by million 
operating revenues for gas increased million  or  over the prior year primarily because of higher natural gas prices in as compared to the company purchases natural gas in the open market and resells it at the same price to its sales service customers 
as a result  increases or decreases in gas revenues driven by gas costs do not impact the company s consolidated gross margin or earnings 
in  the company began using gas swaps to lock in prices for off system sales 
the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  increased million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was due mainly to customer growth  a normal winter heating season during compared to the first quarter of  and the nmprc approved rate increase  partially offset by the decrease in off system transportation sales described above 
global electric agreement in october  pnm entered into a global electric agreement wherein it committed as part of a five year plan to reduce retail electric rates by in two phases a reduction  which became effective on september   and a reduction  which will become effective on september  
the global electric agreement was approved by the nmprc in january while beneficial to pnm s retail electric customers  pnm also benefits from the rate certainty the global electric agreement provides through the end of and several other key components  including the recovery in rates of up to million of surface coal mine reclamation costs and coal contract buyout costs through a commitment by pnm to add load side generation resources generation built within pnm s service territory to serve retail load through if needed to maintain a reserve requirement 
benefits from a disciplined approach to the acquisition and financing of merchant plants  which are generating plants not intended to provide retail electric service 
through december   no nmprc approval is required for pnm s acquisition of or investment in merchant plants so long as pnm meets certain conditions including the following pnm may not invest more than billion in merchant plants of which million has been invested as of december  each of pnm s and the holding company s senior debt is rated investment grade by standard poor s  or  in certain circumstances  by either moody s or fitch ratings 
pnm must spend at least million per year in gas and electric utility infrastructure 
expedited approval of the financing of merchant plant acquisition or investment  so long as pnm meets certain conditions  including the following each of pnm s and the holding company s senior debt is rated investment grade by s p or  in certain circumstances  by either moody s or fitch ratings after the financing 
pnm will maintain a capital structure with no more than debt after the financing 
the acquisition or investment is financed with at least equity 
the forward five year annual average of total merchant plant generating capacity uncommitted to power sales agreements will not exceed and will not exceed in any single year during those five years 
continued joint dispatch of pnm s generating resources in both the regulated and wholesale markets 
the global electric agreement also permits pnm at any time to transfer all or any portion of its merchant plants to an affiliate if pnm s debt to capital ratio will not exceed after giving effect to the transfer and s p confirms that the transfer will not cause pnm s credit rating to fall below investment grade 
subject to pnm s ability to seek an extension not beyond january   the transfer of all interests in wholesale plants out of pnm must occur by the earlier of january  and a date that is one year after pnm has completed the expenditure of billion on merchant plants 
other developments certain developments affecting the company  and which could have a more meaningful impact on its operating results in  are as follows on july   the company entered into an agreement to acquire tnp as discussed above and in note proposed tnp acquisition  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects the proposed tnp acquisition to be accretive to its earnings and free cash flow in the first full year after closing  which is expected in the second quarter of pnm s retail electric rates will decrease again by in september and remain at that level through on june   pnm expanded its long term power sales with a mw contract with the city of mesa  arizona 
in  the company intends to continue its efforts to expand its wholesale business by building on existing relationships and forming new relationships with long term contract customers

the selection and application of those policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
as a result  there exists the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management has identified the following accounting policies that it deems critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that involve significant subjectivity 
management believes that its selection and application of these policies best represent the operating results and financial position of the company 
the following discussion provides information on the processes utilized by management in making judgments and assumptions as they apply to its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition operating revenues are recorded as services are rendered to customers 
the company s utility operations records unbilled revenues representing management s assessment of the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered between the meter reading dates in a particular month and the end of that month 
management estimates unbilled revenues based on sales recorded in the billing system  taking into account weather impacts 
the method is consistent with the approach to normalization employed for rate case billing determinants and the load forecast 
the unbilled revenues estimate is reversed in the following month 
to the extent the estimated amount differs from the amount subsequently billed  revenues will be affected 
at december  and  unbilled revenues in the consolidated balance sheet included estimates of and million  respectively  from the company s utility operations 
regulatory assets and liabilities the company is subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
accordingly  the company has recorded assets and liabilities on its balance sheet resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the company s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas may be affected in the future by competitive forces and restructuring in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no longer applied to all  or a separable portion  of company s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
substantially all of the company s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are reflected in rates charged to retail customers or have been addressed in a regulatory proceeding 
to the extent that the company concludes that the recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable due to regulatory treatment  the effects of competition or other factors  the amount would be recorded as a charge to earnings as recovery is no longer probable 
the company regularly assesses whether its regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction  anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact  developments in the ratemaking process and the ability to recover costs 
as the company s electric rates are fixed  the opportunity to recover increased costs and the costs of new investment in facilities through rates is limited through due to the rate freeze 
as a result  the company defers certain costs based on its expectation that it will recover these costs in future rate cases 
if future recovery of these costs ceases to be probable  the company would be required to record a charge in current period earnings for the portion of the costs that were not recoverable 
asset impairment the company evaluates its tangible long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
these potential impairment indicators include management s assessment of fluctuating market conditions as a result of industry deregulation  planned and scheduled customer purchase commitments  future market penetration  fluctuating market prices resulting from factors including changing fuel costs and other economic conditions  weather patterns  and other market trends 
accounting rules require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset excluding interest charges that will be recognized as expenses when incurred is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company determined that no triggering events occurred during the period for its generation assets 
the company has three turbines  which are currently in storage  with a combined carrying value of approximately million 
the company believes that it will be able to place two of the turbines in service and recover the costs of these two turbines in rates 
the company analyzed the remaining turbine for impairment and concluded no impairment existed based on the company s plans for its use 
the carrying amount of this turbine at december  was million 
the company expects to begin construction utilizing this turbine over the next several years 
if the company were unable to realize these plans  the company would be forced to recognize a loss with respect to the carrying value of the turbine depending on prevailing market conditions 
the company will continue to analyze the turbine for impairment in accordance with sfas pension plan the company and its subsidiaries maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers eligible non union and union employees including officers 
the pension plan was frozen at the end of with regard to new participants  salary levels and benefits 
the company s policy is to fund actuarially determined contributions 
in  the company changed the actuarial valuation measurement date for the pension plan and other postretirement benefits from september to december to better reflect the actual pension balances as of the company s balance sheet dates and recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreasing earnings by million  net of income tax benefit of million 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare  named medicare part d  as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
on july   the company s board approved a resolution amending its retiree healthcare plan in response to medicare part d 
the effect of this change was to reduce expenses by million for the company s income for its pension plan was approximately million for the year ended december   and was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on the pension plan assets of 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  the company evaluated input from its actuaries and its investment consultant  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
this long term rate of return assumption compares to the historical year annualized return of through the end of december the expected long term rate of return on the pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with alternative investments that are primarily real estate  private equity  and absolute return strategies 
the pension plan s actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with alternative investments 
the company reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the asset allocation to the targeted allocation 
the company continues to believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return on the pension plan s assets 
the company will continue to evaluate its actuarial assumptions  including expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
the company bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
if investment return is outside a range of to expected long term rate of return plus or minus  this market related valuation recognizes the portion of return that is outside the range over a five year period from the year in which the return occurs 
since the market related value of assets recognizes the portion of return that is outside the range over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred returns are recorded 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term high grade bonds and management s expectation 
as a result of this review  the company adjusted the rate to at december  from at december  based on an expected rate of return on the pension plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  it is estimated that the pension income for the qualified and non qualified pension plans will approximate million in fiscal year and million in future actual pension income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the company s pension plans 
lowering the pension plan s expected long term rate of return on pension assets by  from to  would have increased pension expense for fiscal year by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by would have increased pension expense for fiscal year by approximately million 
the value of the pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  the company did not make any contributions to the qualified pension plan during and does not expect to make any contributions to the qualified pension plan for the plan year 
self insurance the company self insures for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and automobile claims 
the company maintains insurance with third party insurers in excess of the company s self insured retentions to limit the company s exposure per occurrence or accident  as applicable 
the company s self insurance liabilities reflect the estimated ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon claims filed  estimated claims incurred but not reported  and analyses of industry and historical data 
beginning january   the company began to self insure certain health care costs of its employees 
the company self insures for certain medical and dental benefits for active employees and retirees under the benefit programs 
the company maintains stop loss insurance with third party insurers in excess of the company s self insured retentions to limit the company s exposure per participant  as applicable 
management reviews the amounts recorded for these liabilities on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are appropriate 
while management believes that these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  the company s financial results could be impacted if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims or fluctuations in premiums  differ from the company s estimates 
contingent liabilities there are various claims and lawsuits pending against the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the company has recorded a liability when the effect of litigation can be estimated and where an outcome is considered probable 
management s estimates are based on its knowledge of the relevant facts at the time of the issuance of the company s consolidated financial statements 
subsequent developments could materially alter management s assessment of a matter s probable outcome and the estimate of liability 
environmental issues the company records its environmental liabilities when site assessments or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated 
the company reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly  by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information  including existing technology  current laws and regulations  experience gained at similar sites  and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties 
these estimates include costs for site investigations  remediation  operations and maintenance  monitoring and site closure 
unless there is a probable amount  the company records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs classified as other long term liabilities at undiscounted amounts 
subsequent developments could materially alter management s assessment of a matter s probable outcome and the estimate of liability

pnm used borrowings under the program to repay borrowings under the previous unrated program 
pnm will use the rated commercial paper program to retire other short term borrowings and for other short term cash management needs 
as of february   pnm had million of commercial paper outstanding 
the company s ability  if required  to access the capital markets at a reasonable cost and to provide for other capital needs is largely dependent upon its ability to earn a fair return on equity  its results of operations  its credit ratings  obtaining required regulatory approvals and financial and wholesale market conditions 
financing flexibility is enhanced by providing a high percentage of total capital requirements from internal sources and having the ability  if necessary  to issue long term securities and to obtain short term credit

the lease expense for pvngs is million per year over base lease terms expiring in and in  pnm established the pvngs capital trust for the purpose of acquiring all the debt underlying the pvngs leases 
pnm consolidates the pvngs capital trust in its consolidated financial statements 
the purchase was funded with the proceeds from the issuance of million of suns  which were loaned to the pvngs capital trust 
the pvngs capital trust then acquired and now holds the debt component of the pvngs leases 
for legal and regulatory reasons  the pvngs lease payment continues to be recorded and paid gross with the debt component of the payment returned to pnm through the pvngs capital trust 
as a result  the net cash outflows for the pvngs lease payment were million for the year ended december  the payments due table above reflects the net lease payment 
pnm s other significant operating lease obligations include the eip  a leased interest in transmission line with annual lease payments of million see financing activities below  and an operating lease for the entire output of delta  a gas fired generating plant in albuquerque  new mexico  with imputed annual lease payments of million 
wholesale entered into various long term ppas obligating it to buy electricity for aggregate fixed payments of million plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire december through december in addition  pnm is obligated to sell electricity for million in fixed payments plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire through may as of december   the company had open derivative forward contract positions to buy million and to sell million of electricity 
in addition  the company had open forward positions classified as normal sales of electricity of million and normal purchases of electricity of million  which will be reflected in the financial statements upon physical delivery 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company s wholesale operations entered into various forward contracts for the purchase of gas with the intent to optimize its net generation position 
these contracts  which are derivatives  do not qualify for normal purchase and sale designation pursuant to gaap  and are marked to market 
as of december   the company had open derivative forward contract positions to sell million of gas 
it did not have any open derivative forward contract positions to buy gas at december  the company is a party to two fuel contracts for the four corners and sjgs coal fired power plants with terms expiring in and respectively 
both of these fuel contracts include required purchase provisions  which obligate the company to total minimum take or pay amounts as presented in the payments due table above 
in addition to these take or pay commitments  the company is obligated for certain coal mine decommissioning costs for these operations as described in note commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pnm also contracts for the purchase of gas to serve its retail customers 
these contracts are short term in nature  supplying the gas needs for the current heating season and the following off season months 
the price of gas is a pass through  whereby pnm recovers of its cost of gas 
contingent provisions of certain obligations the holding company and pnm have a number of debt obligations and other contractual commitments that contain contingent provisions 
some of these  if triggered  could affect the liquidity of the company 
the holding company or pnm could be required to provide security  immediately pay outstanding obligations or be prevented from drawing on unused capacity under certain credit agreements if the contingent requirements were to be triggered 
the most significant consequences resulting from these contingent requirements are detailed in the discussion below 
pnm s standard purchase agreement for the procurement of gas for its retail customers contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security for its gas purchase obligations if the seller were to reasonably believe that pnm was unable to fulfill its payment obligations under the agreement 
the master agreement for the sale of electricity in the wspp contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security if its debt were to fall below investment grade rating 
the wspp agreement also contains a contingent requirement  commonly called a material adverse change provision  which could require pnm to provide security if a material adverse change in its financial condition or operations were to occur 
the committed holding company facility contains a ratings trigger  for pricing purposes only 
if the holding company is downgraded or upgraded by the ratings agencies  the result would be an increase or decrease in interest cost  respectively 
the holding company facility contains a material adverse charge provision  which  if triggered  could prevent the holding company from drawing on its unused capacity under the holding company facility except for drawing to repay commercial paper  if the company has any 
in addition  the holding company facility contains a contingent requirement that requires the holding company to maintain a debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  of less than as well as maintenance of an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest ratio of times 
if the holding company s debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  were to exceed or its interest coverage ratio falls below  it could be required to repay all borrowings under the holding company facility  be prevented from drawing on the unused capacity under the holding company facility  and be required to provide security for all outstanding letters of credit issued under the holding company facility 
the committed pnm facility contains a ratings trigger  for pricing purposes only 
if pnm is downgraded or upgraded by the ratings agencies  the result would be an increase or decrease in interest cost  respectively 
the pnm facility contains a material adverse charge provision  which  if triggered  could prevent pnm from drawing on its unused capacity under the pnm facility 
on april   the company amended the material adverse charge provision of the credit agreement to allow drawing to repay commercial paper 
in addition  the pnm facility contains a contingent provision that requires pnm to maintain a debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  of less than as well as maintenance of an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest ratio of times 
if pnm s debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  were to exceed or its interest coverage ratio falls below  pnm could be required to repay all borrowings under the pnm facility  be prevented from drawing on the unused capacity under the pnm facility  and be required to provide security for all outstanding letters of credit issued under the pnm facility 
if a contingent requirement were to be triggered under the pnm facility resulting in an acceleration of the outstanding loans under the pnm facility  a cross default provision in the pvngs leases could occur if the accelerated amount is not paid 
if a cross default provision is triggered  the lessors have the ability to accelerate their rights under the leases  including acceleration of all future lease payments 
financing activities on april   pnm repriced million of tax exempt pcbs  with a previous interest rate of 
the new interest rate is for a term of years 
these bonds will reprice next on april  on april   pnm entered into an unsecured rated commercial paper program 
the company may issue up to million in commercial paper for up to days 
pnm used borrowings under the program to repay borrowings under the previous unrated program 
pnm will use the rated commercial paper program to retire other short term borrowings and for other short term cash management needs 
the pnm facility serves as a backstop for the outstanding commercial paper 
on april   the holding company entered into three fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
the notional principal amount is million 
the company receives a fixed interest payment on a semi annual basis and pay month libor plus basis points 
the initial floating rate was and will be reset each september and march the floating rate was reset on september   to 
on july   pnm repriced million of tax exempt pcbs  with a previous term and interest rate of year and  respectively 
the new interest rate is for a term of years 
these bonds will reprice next on july  on december   the holding company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for a combination of debt and equity securities as well as warrants for million 
the registration statement  when combined with a previously filed shelf registration statement  provides billion of capacity 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on december  and  as of december   no securities had been issued by the holding company under this registration statement 
as of december   pnm had million of remaining unissued securities registered under a previously filed shelf registration statement 
effective january   the holding company entered into a million loan agreement with pnmr services company 
in addition  the holding company made a million equity contribution to pnmr services company on january  these steps were taken to provide pnmr services company with liquidity for its operations 
on december   in an order issued coincident with the holding company registering as a holding company under puhca  the sec authorized the holding company to increase its capitalization in the aggregate amount of billion above its capitalization as of december   through the issuance or sale of common stock  preferred stock  preferred securities  equity linked securities  long term debt  short term debt and convertible securities either directly or through financing conduits 
the financing authority was granted through december   and may be increased 
as a condition of its financing authority  the holding company is required to comply with a number of conditions that are generally consistent with those applicable to other registered holding companies 
the holding company plans to issue million of debt associated with the proposed acquisition of tnp 
the holding company entered into two forward starting floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps on october  that become effective august  and terminate november  the hedged risk associated with these instruments is the changes in cash flows related to the benchmark interest rate 
the holding company will pay a fixed quarterly rate plus a credit spread of and receive payments based on the three month libor  which will be reset quarterly each august  november  february and may this hedge allows the holding company to lock the interest rate on this component of the tnp financing plan at for five years  assuming a closing date for the transaction no later than august  the holding company designated these swaps as cash flow hedges 
the hedged risks associated with these instruments are the changes in cash flows related to general moves in interest rates 
the holding company s assessment of hedge effectiveness is based on changes in the hedge interest rates 
sfas provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transactions affects earnings 
for the year ended december   the holding company recognized no hedge ineffectiveness 
at december   the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments was approximately million favorable to the company 
a forward starting swap does not require any upfront premium  since the premium is imbedded in the rates 
depending on its future business strategy  capital needs and market conditions  the company could enter into additional long term financings for the purpose of strengthening its balance sheet  funding growth and reducing its cost of capital 
the company continues to evaluate its investment and debt retirement options to optimize its financing strategy and earnings potential 
no additional first mortgage bonds may be issued under pnm s mortgage 
the amount of suns that may be issued is not limited by the suns indenture 
however  debt to capital requirements in certain of pnm s financial instruments and regulatory agreements would ultimately limit the amount of additional debt pnm would issue 
dividends the holding company s board regularly reviews the dividend policy 
the declaration of common dividends is dependent upon a number of factors including the ability of the holding company s subsidiaries to pay dividends 
currently  pnm is the holding company s primary source of dividends 
as part of the order approving the formation of the holding company  the nmprc placed certain restrictions on the ability of pnm to pay dividends to the holding company 
pnm cannot pay dividends that will cause its debt rating to go below investment grade 
pnm also cannot pay dividends in any year  as determined on a rolling four quarter basis  in excess of net earnings for that year without prior nmprc approval 
pnm has paid dividends for all eligible amounts under the pre agreement to the holding company 
in january  with the signing of the global electric agreement see note commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the nmprc modified the pnm dividend restriction to allow pnm to pay dividends to the holding company for earnings as well as for equity contributions made by the holding company 
additionally  pnm has various financial covenants  which limit the transfer of assets  whether through dividends or other means 
in addition  the ability of the holding company to declare dividends is dependent upon the extent to which cash flows will support dividends  the availability of earnings  its financial circumstances and performance  the effect of regulatory decisions and legislative activities  future growth plans  the related capital requirements  standard business considerations and market and economic conditions generally 
consistent with the nmprc s holding company order  pnm paid dividends of million to the holding company for the year ended december  on december   the holding company s board approved a increase in the common stock dividend 
the increase raised the quarterly dividend to per share  for an indicated annual dividend of per share 
on december   the holding company s board also announced a revised targeted dividend payout ratio 
the new target is a payout ratio of to of consolidated earnings  revised from to of utility earnings 
capital structure the company s capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  at december  and is shown below december  december  common equity preferred stock long term debt total capitalization total capitalization does not include as debt the present value of pnm s operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta operating lease  which was million as of december  and million as of december  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk as it relates to changes in natural gas and electric prices  changes in interest rates and  historically  adverse market changes for investments held by the company s various trusts 
additionally  the company uses derivative instruments based on certain financial composite indices as part of its enhanced cash management program 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments for wholesale power marketing transactions in order to take advantage of favorable price movements and market timing activities in the wholesale power markets 
the following additional information is provided 
risk management the company controls the scope of its various forms of risk through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures and oversight by senior level management and the holding company board 
the board s finance committee sets the risk limit parameters 
the rmc  comprised of corporate and business segment officers and other managers  oversees all of the activities  which include commodity price  credit  equity  interest rate and business risks 
the rmc has oversight for the ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the risk control organization and policies 
the company has a risk control organization  headed by a risk manager  which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies  procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions  on an enterprise wide basis 
the rmc s responsibilities specifically include establishment of a general policy regarding risk exposure levels and activities in each of the business segments  authority to approve the types of instruments traded  authority to establish a general policy regarding counterparty exposure and limits  authorization and delegation of transaction limits  review and approval of controls and procedures  review and approval of models and assumptions used to calculate mark to market and risk exposure  authority to approve and open brokerage and counterparty accounts  review of hedging and risk activities  and quarterly reporting to the finance committee and the board on these activities 
the rmc also proposes var limits to the finance committee 
the finance committee ultimately sets the company s var limits 
it is the responsibility of each business segment to create its own control procedures and policies within the parameters established by the finance committee 
the rmc reviews and approves these policies  which are created with the assistance of the corporate controller  director of internal audit and the director of financial risk management 
each business segment s policies address the following controls authorized risk exposure limits  authorized instruments and markets  authorized personnel  policies on segregation of duties  policies on mark to market accounting  responsibilities for deal capture  confirmation procedures  responsibilities for reporting results  statement on the role of derivative transactions  and limits on individual transaction size nominal value 
to the extent an open position exists  fluctuating commodity prices can impact financial results and financial position  either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  the company cannot predict with certainty the impact that its risk management decisions may have on its businesses  operating results or financial position 
commodity risk marketing and procurement of energy often involves market risks associated with managing energy commodities and establishing open positions in the energy markets  primarily on a short term basis 
these risks fall into three different categories price and volume volatility  credit risk of counterparties and adequacy of the control environment 
pnm routinely enters into forward contracts  option agreements and price basis swap agreements to hedge price and volume risk on its purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements and to enhance returns and minimize the risk of market fluctuations on the wholesale operations 
the company s wholesale operations  including long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales  are managed through a net asset backed marketing strategy  whereby pnm s aggregate net open forward contract position is covered by its forecasted excess generation capabilities 
pnm is exposed to market risk if its generation capabilities were disrupted or if its retail load requirements were greater than anticipated 
if pnm were required to cover all or a portion of its net open contract position  it would have to meet its commitments through market purchases 
under the derivative accounting rules and the related accounting rules for energy contracts  the company accounts for its various financial derivative instruments for the purchase and sale of energy differently based on management s intent when entering into the contract 
energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas and do not qualify for a normal purchase or sale designation are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value at each period end 
the changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
should an energy transaction qualify as a hedge under sfas  fair market value changes from year to year are recognized on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income 
gains or losses are recognized when the hedged transaction settles 
derivatives that meet the normal sales and purchases exceptions within sfas are not marked to market but rather recorded in results of operations when the underlying transaction settles 
the following table shows the net fair value of mark to market energy contracts included in the balance sheet december  in thousands mark to market energy contracts current asset long term asset total mark to market assets current liability long term liability total mark to market liabilities net fair value of mark to market energy contracts the mark to market energy portfolio positions represent net assets at december  after netting all applicable open purchase and sale contracts 
the market prices used to value pnm s mark to market energy portfolio are based on index prices and broker quotations 
in  the company entered into a long term physical option contract and a long term financial gas swap contract that were classified as derivatives and consequently mark to market through earnings 
generally  market data to value these types of transactions is available for the next month period only  the remaining time period  referred to as the illiquid period  is valued using internally developed pricing data 
as a result  during  the company began to record liquidity reserves on these contracts for market gains and losses in the illiquid period  effectively limiting the mark to market valuation to a rolling month period 
the company regularly assesses the validity and availability of pricing data for the illiquid period of its derivative transactions and adjusts its liquidity reserves  accordingly 
the following table provides detail of changes in the company s mark to market energy portfolio net asset or liability balance sheet position from one period to the next twelve months ended december  in thousands sources of fair value gain loss fair value at beginning of year amount realized on contracts delivered during period change in valuation method changes in fair value net fair value at end of period net change recorded as mark to market change in valuation method based on illiquid market data utilized for initial valuation of long term physical option contract and long term gas swap contract 
the following table provides the maturity of the net assets liabilities of the company  giving an indication of when these mark to market amounts will settle and generate use cash 
the following values were determined using broker quotes fair value at december  maturities less than year years total in thousands as of december   a decrease in market pricing of pnm s mark to market energy portfolio by would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of less than 
conversely  an increase in market pricing of this portfolio by would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of less than 
the company measures the market risk of these long term contracts and wholesale activities using a var calculation to maintain the company s total exposure within management prescribed limits 
the company s var calculation reports the possible market loss for the respective portfolio 
this calculation is based on the portfolio s fair market value on the reporting date 
accordingly  the var calculation is not a measure of the potential accounting mark to market loss 
in  the company utilized the variance covariance model of var  which is a probabilistic model that measures the risk of loss to earnings in market sensitive instruments 
the variance covariance model relies on statistical relationships to analyze how changes in different markets can affect a portfolio of instruments with different characteristics and market exposure 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
the quantitative risk information  however  is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being evaluated may trigger a potential loss in excess of calculated amounts if changes in commodity prices exceed the confidence level of the model used 
the var methodology employs the following critical parameters volatility estimates  market values of open positions  appropriate market oriented holding periods and seasonally adjusted correlation estimates 
the company s var calculation considers the company s forward position for the next eighteen months 
the company uses a holding period of three days as the estimate of the length of time that will be needed to liquidate the positions 
the volatility and the correlation estimates measure the impact of adverse price movements both at an individual position level as well as at the total portfolio level 
the two tailed confidence level established is 
for example  if var is calculated at million  it is estimated at a confidence level that if prices move against pnm s positions  the company s pre tax gain or loss in liquidating the portfolio would not exceed million in the three days that it would take to liquidate the portfolio 
in  the company adopted the monte carlo simulation model of var 
the monte carlo model utilizes a random generated simulation based on historical volatility to generate portfolio values 
the company continues to utilize the two tailed confidence level at 
the company s var is regularly monitored by the company s rmc 
the rmc has put in place procedures to ensure that increases in var are reviewed and  if deemed necessary  acted upon to reduce exposures 
the var represents an estimate of the potential gains or losses that could be recognized on pnm s wholesale power marketing portfolios given current volatility in the market  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ due to actual fluctuations in market prices  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  as well as changes to pnm s wholesale power marketing portfolios during the year 
the company accounts for the sale of electric generation in excess of its retail needs or the purchase of power for retail needs as normal purchases and sales under sfas transactions that do not meet the normal purchase or sale exception or the definition of a hedge under sfas are accounted for as energy marketing contracts and comprise pnm s mark to market portfolio 
the company s var limit for the mark to market portfolio was million at december  the company also calculates a total portfolio var  which in addition to its mark to market portfolio includes total forecasted generation and retail load  all contracts designated as normal sales and purchases and all hedge transactions 
the forecasted generation and retail load are determined using average peak forecasts for the respective block of power 
the company s portfolio var limit was million at december  the following table shows the high  average and low market risk as measured by var on the company s portfolios using three day holding period at a two tailed confidence level twelve months ended period high average low end december  in thousands mark to market portfolio total portfolio december  mark to market portfolio total portfolio in  the company revised its methodologies for calculating var in order to improve its ability to measure and manage risk 
as a result  the company also revised its var limits to be consistent with the new methodologies 
as previously discussed  the company adopted the monte carlo statistical simulation approach 
in addition  the company redefined its portfolios on which it measures var 
the total portfolio var now is based solely on its merchant activities and excludes all effects from the retail operations and the joint dispatch model employed by the company 
in addition  the company defined a speculative portfolio that captures all transactions that are not asset based and have the economic risk 
the var limit established for the speculative portfolio and the total portfolio were million and million  respectively 
the speculative portfolio is a sub set of the total portfolio 
credit risk pnm is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment by counterparties 
the company uses a credit management process to assess and monitor the financial conditions of counterparties 
credit exposure is also regularly monitored by the rmc 
the company provides for losses due to market and credit risk 
pnm s credit risk with its largest counterparty as of december  was million 
the following table provides information related to pnm s credit exposure as of december  the company does not hold any credit collateral as of december  the table further delineates that exposure by the credit worthiness credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance as to the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties pnm may have 
also provided is an indication of the maturity of a company s credit risk by credit ratings of the counterparties 
schedule of wholesale operations credit risk exposure december  rating a b net credit risk exposure number of counter parties net exposure of counter parties dollars in thousands investment grade non investment grade internal ratings non investment grade total a rating included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum s p rating of bbb or moody s rating of baa if the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity eg  its parent  determination is based on the rating of its guarantor 
b the net credit risk exposure is the net credit exposure to pnm from its wholesale operations 
this includes long term contracts  forward sales and short term sales 
the exposure captures the net amounts due to pnm from receivables payables for realized transactions  delivered and unbilled revenues  and mark to market gains losses pursuant to contract terms 
exposures are offset according to legally binding netting arrangements and reduced by credit collateral 
credit collateral includes cash deposits  letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties 
amounts are presented before those reserves that are determined on a portfolio basis 
maturity of credit risk exposure as of december  rating less than years years total net exposure in thousands investment grade non investment grade internal ratings non investment grade total natural gas supply contracts pnm hedges certain portions of natural gas supply contracts in order to protect its retail customers from adverse price fluctuations in the natural gas market 
the financial impact of all hedge gains and losses  including the related costs of the program  is recoverable through the pgac 
as a result  earnings are not affected by gains and losses generated by these instruments 
interest rate risk pnm has long term debt which subjects it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
the majority of the company s long term debt is fixed rate debt  and therefore  does not expose the company s earnings to a major risk of loss due to adverse changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of all long term debt instruments would increase by approximately  or million  if interest rates were to decline by basis points from their levels at december  as of december   the fair value of pnm s long term debt was billion as compared to a book value of million 
in general  an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows to the extent not recoverable in rates if pnm were to re acquire all or a portion of its debt instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
the company contributed cash of approximately million to other post retirement benefits for plan year the securities held by the trusts had an estimated fair value of million as of december   of which approximately were fixed rate debt securities that subject the company to risk of loss of fair value with movements in market interest rates 
if rates were to increase by basis points from their levels at december   the decrease in the fair value of the securities would be or million 
pnm does not currently recover or return through rates any losses or gains on these securities 
the company  therefore  is at risk for shortfalls in its funding of its obligations due to investment losses 
the company does not believe that long term market returns over the period of funding will be less than required for the company to meet its obligations 
however  this belief is based on assumptions about future returns that are inherently uncertain 
equity market risk pnm contributes to trusts established to fund its share of the decommissioning costs of pvngs and pension and other postretirement benefits 
the trusts hold certain equity securities as of december  these equity securities also expose the company to losses in fair value 
approximately of the securities held by the various trusts were equity securities as of december  the company is currently implementing a change in the asset allocation in the pension portfolio  which will reduce the domestic equity exposure from to 
similar to the debt securities held for funding decommissioning and certain pension and other postretirement costs  pnm does not recover or earn a return through rates on any losses or gains on these equity securities 
in  the company implemented an enhanced cash management strategy using derivative instruments based on the s p  s p  and nasdaq composite indices 
the company terminated the use of this derivative trading strategy in january and changed the investment management structure 
the new structure includes a preferred stock dividend capture strategy and various absolute return strategies that have the objective of achieving returns higher than that associated with cash management plans and with bond like volatility 
the company s initial investment in the enhanced cash management program was million 
as of december   this investment  including profits and interest  totaled million

because actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements 
many factors could cause actual results to differ  and will effect future financial condition  cash flow and operating results 
these factors include risks and uncertainties relating to the receipt of regulatory approvals for the proposed acquisition of tnp  the risks that the businesses will not be integrated successfully  the risk that the benefits of the tnp transaction will not be fully realized or will take longer to realize than expected  disruption from the tnp transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers  employees  suppliers or other third parties  conditions in the financial markets relevant to the proposed tnp acquisition  interest rates  weather  water supply  fuel costs  availability of fuel supplies  risk management and commodity risk transactions  seasonality and other changes in supply and demand in the market for electric power  wholesale power prices  market liquidity  the competitive environment in the electric and natural gas industries  the performance of generating units and transmission systems  the ability of the company to secure long term power sales  the risks associated with completion of construction of luna  including construction delays and unanticipated cost overruns  state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions  the outcome of legal proceedings  changes in applicable accounting principles  the performance of state  regional and national economies  and the other factors described in risk factors in this report 
see also item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk above for information about the risks associated with the company s use of derivative financial instruments 
securities act disclaimer certain securities to be issued in connection with the tnp acquisition transaction described in this document have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  or any state securities laws and may not be reoffered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of and applicable state securities laws 
this form k does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities 
risk factors the company s business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below and elsewhere under this heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report 
the company may not be able to complete its acquisition of tnp 
if the company does not complete the acquisition  dilution to its earnings per share will result unless the company is able to avoid or mitigate such dilution 
on july   the company entered into an agreement with tnp to acquire all the outstanding common stock of tnp for approximately million comprised of equal amounts of our common stock and cash 
the company will also assume approximately million of tnp s net debt and senior redeemable cumulative preferred stock 
although the company has received anti trust clearance under the hart scott rodino act  the proposed tnp acquisition remains subject to various other regulatory approvals  including the nmprc  the puct  the sec  and the ferc and other customary closing conditions 
on january   epe filed a motion to intervene and protest with the ferc 
epe alleged that the holding company and tnmp did not provide sufficient analysis to determine if there were anti competitive effects from the transaction and conditionally requested that the ferc schedule a hearing pending receipt of the analyses epe alleged is required 
on february   the holding company and tnmp filed a joint motion seeking leave to file an answer  attaching the answer which contends that the application contains sufficient information required by the ferc for a transmission only acquisition and that epe s allegations are speculative and unsubstantiated 
the answer requests denial of the protest and approval of the transaction as requested in the application 
on february   the ferc issued a notice of meeting for march   which includes the application as a matter to be considered 
although the company expects to complete the transaction by the second quarter of  the company cannot be certain that all of the required approvals will be obtained  or the other closing conditions will be satisfied  within that time frame  if at all  or without terms and conditions that may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if the company is unable to complete the proposed tnp acquisition  any issuance of common stock in anticipation of the acquisition will result in dilution to the company s earnings per share unless the company is able to avoid or mitigate such dilution 
the company may fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  including tnp  into its other businesses or otherwise fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of pending and future acquisitions 
as part of the company s growth strategy  the company is pursuing  and intends to continue to pursue  a disciplined acquisition strategy 
while the company expects to identify potential synergies  cost savings  and growth opportunities prior to the acquisition and integration of acquired companies or assets  the company may not be able to achieve these anticipated benefits due to  among other things delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets higher than expected costs or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties diversion of the attention and resources of our management reliance on inaccurate assumptions in evaluating the expected benefits of a given acquisition inability to retain key employees or key customers of acquired companies assumption of liabilities unrecognized in the due diligence process with respect to the proposed tnp acquisition  the company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully integrate tnp with the company s current businesses 
the integration of tnp with the company s other businesses will present significant challenges and  as a result  the company may not be able to operate the combined company as effectively as expected 
also  even if pnm manages to realize greater than anticipated benefits from the integration of tnp into its business  as a regulated entity  pnm may be required by its regulators to return these benefits to its ratepayers 
the company may also fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as quickly or as cost effectively as anticipated or may not be able to achieve those benefits at all 
while the company expects that this acquisition will be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first full year of operation after the transaction is completed  this expectation is based on important assumptions  including assumptions related to interest rates  market prices for power  our ability to achieve operational benefits from operating the companies as a unified operation and the percentage of tnp s customers that the company will be able to retain  which may ultimately be incorrect 
in addition  the agreement the company has entered into with the puct staff and others relating to the proposed tnp acquisition includes a two year electric rate freeze and a million annual rate reduction in tnmp s retail delivery rates effective may   which could adversely affect profitability if costs at tnmp are not controlled 
as a result  if the company is unable to integrate its businesses with tnp effectively or achieve the benefits anticipated  the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
the company is subject to complex government regulation  which may have a negative impact on its business  financial position and results of operations 
the company is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal  state and local regulatory agencies  which significantly influences the company s operating environment and may affect the company s ability to recover costs from utility customers 
in particular  the nmprc  the sec  the ferc  the nrc  the epa  and the nmed regulate many aspects of our utility operations  including siting and construction of facilities  conditions of service  the issuance of securities  and the rates that the company can charge customers 
the company is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from these agencies to operate its business 
the rates that the company s principal subsidiary  pnm  is allowed to charge for its retail services are the single most important item influencing the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
as discussed below  pnm is subject to a rate freeze providing for no changes in retail electric rates through december   subject to limited exceptions 
as a public utility holding company  the company is subject to regulation by the sec under puhca 
the rules and regulations promulgated under puhca impose a number of restrictions on the operations of registered public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries 
these restrictions include a requirement that  subject to a number of exceptions  the sec approve in advance securities issuances  acquisitions and dispositions of utility assets or of securities of utility companies  and acquisitions of other businesses 
puhca also generally limits the operations of a registered public utility holding company to a single integrated public utility system  plus additional energy related businesses 
pucha requires that transactions between affiliated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at cost  with limited exceptions 
the company is unable to predict the impact on its business and operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require the company to incur additional expenses or change business operations  and therefore may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
because of pending federal regulatory reforms  the public utility industry is undergoing a fundamental change 
new mexico repealed the electric utility industry restructuring act of in and abandoned its plans to transform the industry from one of vertically integrated monopolies to one with deregulated  competitive generation 
however  the ferc has proposed a standard market design  which would establish independently governed regional transmission organizations with common rules for market operations 
the ferc s efforts have been opposed by a number of states  primarily in the southeast and the west  because of concern that the standard market design does not provide for regional differences and does not represent a cost efficient approach to wholesale markets 
energy legislation  which could affect the ferc s activities  remains under consideration in congress 
in  in an attempt to ease concerns with its standard market design proposal  the ferc issued a white paper defining a wholesale power market platform which would replace the standard market design 
both the standard market design and wholesale power market platform proposals are still pending further action by the ferc 
the company s future results will be impacted by the form of the ferc rules  if adopted  the costs of complying with rules and legislation that may call for regulatory reforms for the industry  and the resulting market prices for electricity and natural gas 
pnm s retail electric rate reduction and retail electric rate freeze could affect its profit margin if it does not control costs 
with nmprc approval  pnm agreed to decrease its retail electric rates by in two phases as follows effective september   and an additional effective september  pnm also agreed to freeze these reduced retail electric rates through december  pnm s costs  however  are not frozen 
thus  pnm s ability to maintain its profit margins depends upon increased demand for electricity and pnm s efforts to control costs incurred in supplying that electricity  including  in particular  its coal costs 
pnm does not have the benefit of a fuel adjustment clause for its retail electric operations that would allow it to recover increased fuel and purchased power costs from customers 
therefore  to the extent that pnm has not hedged its fuel and power costs  it is exposed to changes in fuel and power prices to the extent fuel for its electric generating facilities and power must be purchased on the open market in order for it to serve its retail electric customers 
pnm anticipates being able to reduce base fuel costs as a result of its revised coal contract relating to the new underground mine serving sjgs 
however  if the anticipated base fuel cost savings do not occur because of problems at the new mine or if pnm cannot control other operating expenses  the retail electric rate freeze may decrease pnm s profit margin 
the retail electric rate freeze will also affect pnm s ability to earn a return or recover from its customers costs associated with investments in generation  transmission and distribution facilities since it will not be able to increase retail electric rates to recover those costs until at least after the end of the rate freeze 
for example  in connection with the electric retail rate freeze stipulation  pnm agreed to invest million per year through in gas and electric utility infrastructure 
if future recovery of these costs ceases to be probable  pnm would be required to record a charge to earnings in the period for the portion of the costs that were determined not to be recoverable 
the electric retail rate freeze stipulation does  however  allow pnm to seek a general rate adjustment for certain changes in environmental or tax laws 
the company is not able to predict what rate treatment pnm will receive following the expiration of the retail electric rate freeze in new mexico 
some of the factors that influence rates are largely outside the company s control 
in response to competitive  economic  political  legislative and or regulatory pressures pnm may have to agree to further rate freezes  rate refunds or rate reductions  any or all of which could have a significant adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the company is currently the subject of several regulatory proceedings and named in multiple lawsuits with respect to the company s participation in western energy markets 
the ferc is conducting industry wide proceedings and investigations related to the alleged dysfunctions of the organized california market and the pacific northwest market during and in september  an alj  conducted hearings regarding sales into the california wholesale electric market by pnm and others in and the alj then issued proposed findings on california refund liability in december  determining that the california independent system operator had  for the most part  correctly calculated the amounts of potential refunds owed by sellers 
in march  the ferc issued an order substantially adopting the alj s findings  but requiring a change to the formula used to calculate refunds  which would have the effect of increasing pnm s refund liability in september  the ninth circuit issued its decision in one of the lead appellate cases addressing the ferc s refund order 
the ninth circuit determined that the ferc has the authority to order refunds for these transactions if it elects to do so and remanded the case to the ferc for further proceedings  including a determination as to whether additional refunds are appropriate 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any ferc proceeding that may result from the final decision or whether pnm will ultimately be directed to make any additional future refunds as a result of the decision 
for the proceedings related to the pacific northwest market  in june  the ferc denied the request of certain parties for retroactive refunds for spot market sales 
in november  the ferc denied rehearing requests made by certain parties seeking refunds in the pacific northwest markets 
the port of seattle filed a petition for review of the ferc s decision with the ninth circuit in november the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this appeal  or whether pnm will ultimately be directed to make any refunds 
in addition  the california attorney general filed a complaint with the ferc against certain companies  including pnm  and all other public utility sellers in california alleging that sellers with market based rates have violated their tariffs by not filing with the ferc transaction specific information about all of their sales and purchases at market based rates 
as a result  the california ag contends that all past sales should be subject to refund if found to be above just and reasonable levels 
the complaint was denied by the ferc and subsequently appealed by the california attorney general to the ninth circuit 
in september  the ninth circuit upheld the ferc s market based rate authority  but held that the ferc violated its administrative discretion by declining to investigate whether it should order refunds from sellers who failed to provide transaction specific reports to the ferc as required by its rules 
the ninth circuit determined that the ferc has the authority to order refunds for these transactions if it elects to do so and remanded the case back to the ferc for further proceedings  including a determination as to whether additional refunds are appropriate 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or whether it ultimately will be directed to make any additional future refunds as a result 
the california attorney general has also threatened litigation against pnm in a state court in california based on similar allegations 
on june   pnm received notice that it had been included in a list of defendants that have been sued by the city of tacoma department of public utilities  or tacoma  in federal district court in the state of washington 
the complaint alleged pnm and certain other defendants  who allegedly engaged in buying  selling and marketing power in california and other locations in the western united states  acted in concert among themselves and with non defendant trading co conspirators that were engaged in conduct that amounted to market manipulations  which the complaint defines as a pattern of activities that had the purpose and effect of creating the impression that the demand for power was higher  the supply of power was lower  or both  than was in fact the case 
the complaint alleged these activities of the trading defendants and the co conspirators resulted in substantially increased prices for energy in the pacific northwest spot market in excess of what otherwise would have been the price absent such unlawful acts  in violation of antitrust laws 
the complaint asserted damages in excess of million from the multiple defendants 
there have been three recent ninth circuit decisions that  collectively  appear to make tacoma s case more difficult to prevail 
as a result  pnm joined a motion to dismiss the tacoma complaint given ninth circuit precedent 
in a decision issued in february  the district court judge in the case granted defendants motion to dismiss 
as a result  the antitrust lawsuit against pnm filed by the city of tacoma department of public utilities has been dismissed 
in addition to the regulatory proceedings and litigation described above  pnm is also involved in other regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of pnm s participation in the western energy markets that are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although the company does not believe the outcome of any of these proceedings or litigation will have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity  the company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or litigation 
there are inherent risks in the operation of nuclear facilities  such as environmental  health and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 
pnm has a undivided interest in pvngs  with portions of its interests in units and held under leases 
pvngs is subject to environmental  health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel  the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning  potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities  and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems 
pnm maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks  however  it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage 
although the decommissioning trust funds are designed to provide adequate funds for decommissioning at the end of the expected life of the pvngs units  there is the risk of insufficient decommissioning trust funds in the event of early decommissioning of the units 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
in addition  although the company has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at pvngs  if an incident did occur  it could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 
each pvngs lease describes certain events  including events of loss or deemed loss events  the occurrence of which could require pnm to  among other things  i pay the lessor and the equity investor  in return for the investor s interest in pvngs  cash in the amount provided in the lease and ii assume debt obligations relating to the pvngs lease 
the events of loss generally relate to casualties  accidents and other events at pvngs  which would severely  adversely affect the ability of the operating agent  aps  to operate  and the ability of pnm to earn a return on its interests in  pvngs 
the deemed loss events consist mostly of legal and regulatory changes such as changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal  or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations 
the company believes that the probability of such events of loss or deemed loss events occurring is remote for the following reasons i to a large extent  prevention of events of loss and some deemed loss events is within the control of the pvngs participants  including the company  and the pvngs operating agent  through the general pvngs operational and safety oversight process and ii with respect to other deemed loss events  which would involve a significant change in current law and policy  the company is unaware of any pending proposals or proposals being considered for introduction in congress  or in any state legislative or regulatory body that  if adopted  would cause any of those events 
the operation of pvngs requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed and or extended 
we do not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses 
however  as a result of potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities  the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict 
the company s financial performance may be adversely affected if its power plants and transmission and distribution system are not successfully operated 
the company s financial performance depends on the successful operation of its generation  transmission and distribution assets 
unscheduled or longer than expected maintenance outages  other performance problems with the company s electric generation assets  severe weather conditions  accidents and other catastrophic events  disruptions in the delivery of fuel and other factors could reduce its excess generation capacity and therefore limit the company s ability to opportunistically sell excess power in the wholesale market 
diminished generation capacity could also result in the company s aggregate net open forward electric sales position being larger than its forecasted generation capacity 
if this were to occur  the company would have to make purchases of electricity in the wholesale market under contracts priced at the time of execution or  if in the spot market  at the then current market price 
there can be no assurance that sufficient electricity would be available at reasonable prices  or at all  if such a situation were to occur 
failures of transmission or distribution facilities may also cause interruptions in the services the company provides 
these potential generation  distribution and transmission problems  and any potentially related service interruptions  could result in lost revenues and additional costs 
the company s counterparties may not meet their obligations to us 
the company is exposed to risk that counterparties  which owe the company money  energy or other commodities or services  will not be able to perform their obligations 
the possibility that certain counterparties may fail to perform their obligations has increased due to financial difficulties  in some cases brought on by improper or illegal accounting and business practices  affecting some participants in the energy industry 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  the company might be forced to honor the underlying commitment at then current market prices 
in such event  the company might incur losses in addition to amounts  if any  already paid to the counterparties 
the company s operations are subject to risks beyond its control that may reduce its revenues 
the company s revenues are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas 
that demand can vary greatly based upon weather conditions  seasonality and temperature extremes fluctuations in economic activity and growth in our service area and the western region of the united states the extent of additional energy available from current or new competitors weather conditions will impact the revenues that the company obtains from its electric wholesale sales 
very warm and very cold temperatures  especially for prolonged periods  can dramatically increase the demand for electricity for cooling and heating  respectively  as opposed to the effect of more moderate temperatures 
very warm temperatures inside the company s service territory reduce the amount of power available to sell on the wholesale market 
drought conditions in new mexico generally  and especially in the four corners region  in which the san juan generating station and the four corners generating station are located  may affect the water supply for our generating plants 
if adequate precipitation is not received in the watershed that supplies the four corners areas  the company may have to decrease generation at these plants  which would reduce the company s ability to sell excess power on the wholesale market and reduce its revenues 
as such  if the drought conditions continue or regulators or legislators take action to limit the company s supply of water  the company s business may be adversely impacted 
although the company has been able to maintain adequate access to water in the past  the company cannot be certain that it will be able to do so in the future 
an inability to access capital could limit the company s ability to execute its growth strategy and finance capital requirements  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the company relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations  which could include capital requirements for energy infrastructure investments and funding new programs 
if the company is not able to access capital at competitive rates or at all  the company s ability to implement its growth strategy and its ability to finance capital requirements  if needed  will be limited 
the company believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon the company s current credit ratings 
however  market disruptions or a downgrade of the company s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect the company s ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements  which could have a material effect on its business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
such disruptions could include an economic downturn capital markets conditions generally the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company increased market prices for electricity and gas terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of unrelated energy companies the overall health of the utility industry a significant reduction in the company s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the company cannot be sure that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade could increase the company s borrowing costs  which would diminish its financial results could require the company to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and the potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease could increase our borrowing costs under certain of the company s existing credit facilities could also require the company to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties could limit our access to the commercial paper market below investment grade credit ratings would require approvals from the nmprc for new wholesale plant projects and for continuing to participate in wholesale plant projects of more than a certain dollar value and under certain conditions the ratings from rating agencies reflect only the views of such rating agencies and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any downgrade or withdrawal of the company s current ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of its outstanding debt 
costs of environmental compliance  liabilities and litigation could exceed the company s estimates which could adversely affect the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital  operating and other costs  including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations 
the company cannot predict how it would be affected if existing environmental laws and regulations were revised  or if new environmental laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment were adopted  but any such changes could increase the company s financing requirements or otherwise adversely affect the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
revised or additional laws and regulations could also result in additional operating restrictions on the company s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable in our rates  thereby reducing the company s net income 
for example  any future changes in the interpretation of the clean air act s new source review provisions could potentially increase the company s operating and maintenance costs substantially 
similarly  the epa has proposed rules that would regulate mercury emissions from coal fired generation plants 
the company cannot be certain if these proposed rules will be adopted or how they would affect the company if they were adopted 
in addition  the company may be designated as a responsible party for environmental clean up at a site identified by a regulatory body 
the company cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up and compliance costs  and the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond the company s control  may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against the company 
for example  in october  the tceq requested information from pnm concerning any involvement that pnm had with sesco  a former electrical equipment repair and sales company located in san angelo  texas 
pnm was informed that the tceq and the epa claim to have identified contamination of the soil and groundwater at the site 
tceq is conducting a site investigation of a sesco facility pursuant to the texas solid waste act  and the sesco site has been referred to the superfund site discovery and assessment program 
the primary concern appears to be polychlorinated biphenyls in soil and groundwater on and adjacent to the site 
the tceq is conducting the site investigation to determine what remediation activities are required at the sesco site and to identify potentially responsible parties 
on february   pnm agreed to participate in the potentially responsible party committee 
pnm will voluntarily participate with the others in the investigation and may participate in any required remediation at the sesco facility in san angelo  texas 
pnm is still investigating its role in the matter  and is unable to predict the outcome at this time 
the company s business  results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected if the company does not successfully compete for wholesale customers and generation plant acquisition opportunities 
our wholesale plants will be exposed to price risk to the extent they must compete for the sale of energy and capacity 
the electric utility industry has experienced a substantial increase in competition at the wholesale level  caused by changes in federal law and regulatory policy 
as a result of the public utility regulatory policies act of and the energy policy act of  competition in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity suppliers  non utility generators  independent power producers  wholesale power marketers and brokers  and due to the trading of energy futures contracts on various commodities exchanges 
in  the ferc issued new rules on transmission service to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on a nationwide basis 
the rules give greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale power customers 
also  in july  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which has not yet been adopted related to open access transmission service and standard electricity market design 
as a result of the changing regulatory environment and the relatively low barriers to entry which include  in addition to open access transmission service  relatively low construction costs for new generating facilities  the company expects competition to steadily increase 
this increased competition could affect the company s load forecasts  acquisition opportunities and wholesale energy sales and related revenues 
given that during  the company s sales in the wholesale electric market accounted for approximately of our total mwh sales  the impact of these changes on the company s financial results could be material 
the effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial position could vary depending on the extent to which the company is are able to acquire additional generation to compete in the wholesale market new opportunities are created for the company to expand its wholesale load current wholesale customers elect to purchase from other suppliers after existing contracts expire the company s long term contracts to supply power expire from through the company s ability to renew these contracts at terms comparable to those currently in place is dependent upon prevailing market conditions at the time of negotiations 
currently  the company has a long term firm commitment contract with tnp of mw that expires in the contract is priced above current market prices 
if the tnp acquisition is completed  the company expects to provide the power supply needs of tnp 
however  if the tnp acquisition is not completed  the company believes that it will be able to significantly mitigate any revenue loss due to rising short term and forward markets 
to the extent electric capacity generated by the company s wholesale plants is not under contract to be sold or committed to serving our retail electric load  either now or in the future  the company s business  results of operations and financial position will generally depend on the prices that can be obtained for energy and capacity in new mexico and adjacent markets 
among the factors that would influence these prices  all of which are beyond the company s control to a significant degree  are those described in the next risk factor 
the company may not be able to mitigate fuel and wholesale electricity pricing risks  which could result in unanticipated liabilities or increased volatility in its earnings 
the company s business and operations are subject to changes in purchased power prices and fuel costs that may cause increases in the amounts the company must pay for power supplies on the wholesale market and the cost of producing power in its generation plants 
as evidenced by the california energy crisis in  prices for electricity  fuel and natural gas may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose the company to significant commodity price risks 
among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel are prevailing market prices for coal  oil  natural gas and other fuels used in the company s generation plants  including associated transportation costs  and supplies of such commodities changes in the regulatory framework for the commodities markets that the company relies on for purchased power and fuel liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market the actions of external parties  such as the ferc or independent system operators  that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the western energy markets weather conditions impacting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies the rate of growth in electricity as a result of population changes  regional economic conditions and the implementation of conservation programs union and labor relations natural disasters  wars  embargoes and other catastrophic events changes in federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations the company utilizes derivatives such as forward contracts  futures contracts  options and swaps to manage these risks 
the company attempts to manage its exposure from these activities through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures 
the company cannot be certain that these strategies will be successful in managing its pricing risk  or that they will not result in net liabilities to the company as a result of future volatility in these markets 
in addition  although the company routinely enters into contracts to offset its positions ie to hedge our exposure to the risks of demand  market effects of weather and changes in commodity prices  the company does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility
