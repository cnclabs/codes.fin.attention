critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies are deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time the product is shipped  with provisions established for estimated product returns and returns related to one business segment s stock scrap program with distributors 
upon shipment  the company provides for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranties 
rebates and other sales incentives offered by the company are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time of shipment 
revenue recognition is significant because net sales is a key component of results of operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
the company follows generally accepted guidelines in measuring revenue 
revenue is recorded in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
however  certain judgments affect the application of its revenue policy 
for a discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv in this annual report on form k 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  the company evaluates specific accounts where it has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a general reserve is established for all customers based on several factors  including historical write offs as a percentage of sales 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
page inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  and continually reviews the book value of discontinued product lines to determine if these items are properly valued 
the company identifies these items and assesses the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation 
if market value is less than cost  then related inventory is adjusted to market value 
if a write down to the current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value  which is defined as selling price less costs to complete and dispose  and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin 
the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies slow moving and excess inventories 
inventory items identified as slow moving or excess are evaluated to determine if reserves are required 
if the company is not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at current market value  it would have to adjust its reserves accordingly 
accounting for income taxes the company s income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company follows the guidelines under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
in determining the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides any necessary allowances as required 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent it establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  it must include expense or income  as the case may be  within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company had recorded total valuation allowances of  due to uncertainties related to the utilization of some deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain research and development tax credits  loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax assets as of december  were  net of valuation allowances of page  the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the reliability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
our results do not reflect the impact of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
we have completed the process of re evaluating our position with respect to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings to take into account the possible election of the repatriation provisions contained in the jobs act and it had no impact on the company 
legal contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv to this annual report on form k  the company has accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed after investigation and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
management does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in these assumptions  or the effectiveness of these strategies  related to these proceedings 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets the company s long lived and intangible assets primarily consist of fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
effective january   the company adopted sfas and performed a transitional test of its goodwill and intangible assets 
no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the initial impairment test 
goodwill was also tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  and assets to be disposed of whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company page assesses the recoverability of the asset by estimated cash flows and at times by independent appraisals 
it compares estimated cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets  or the appraised value of the asset  to the carrying amounts to determine whether impairment has occurred 
if the estimate of cash flows expected to be generated changes in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges that were not previously recorded for these assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
environmental expenditures the company is subject to united states and mexican environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to surface and subsurface waters  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
the company is also subject to other federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that require it to remediate or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of certain chemical substances at various sites  including some where the company has ceased operations 
it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have in the future 
expenditures that relate to current operations are charged to expense or capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed and recorded as part of discontinued operations 
expenditures include costs of remediation and legal fees to defend against claims for environmental liability 
liabilities are recorded when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the liability for remediation expenditures includes  as appropriate  elements of costs such as site investigations  consultants fees  feasibility studies  outside contractor expenses and monitoring expenses 
estimates are not discounted  and they are not reduced by potential claims for recovery from insurance carriers 
the liability is periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress  prospective estimates of required activity and other relevant factors  including changes in technology or regulations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part iv of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles
