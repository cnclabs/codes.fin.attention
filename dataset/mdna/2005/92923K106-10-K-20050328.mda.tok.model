earnings overview for the years ended december   and the company reported net earnings of million in  million in and million in  representing an increase of between fiscal years and and an increase of between fiscal years and the increases over the three fiscal years are primarily attributable to the bank s continued loan growth  higher non interest income and lower increases in non interest expense 
net earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were for  for and for  representing an increase of between fiscal years and and between fiscal years and the net earnings per share for and for the entire year and for a partial year were affected by the previously described common stock offering completed in april  which increased the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
return on average assets and return on average shareholders equity for was and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  for  and and  respectively  for the company experienced its largest annual loan growth in terms of dollars in its almost year history in total loans grew by over million  or over 
this loan growth contributed to the company s earnings growth offsetting the approximately decline in mortgage origination fees from to in the first half of  the company earned million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in the second half of when comparing earnings for the first half of to that in the second half of  the company experienced an earnings growth of 
net interest income the company s operational results primarily depend on the earnings of the bank 
the bank s earnings depend  to a large degree  on net interest income 
net interest income is defined as the difference between the interest income received from its investments such as loans  investment securities  federal funds sold  etc 
and the interest expense on deposits and other borrowings 
the following discussion and analysis of net interest margin assumes and is stated on a tax equivalent basis 
that is  non taxable interest is restated at its taxable equivalent rate 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure the relative profitability of net interest income 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of non interest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the other commonly used measure is net interest margin 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percent of average total interest earning assets and takes into account the positive impact of investing non interest bearing deposits 
net interest income for the company increased by million  or  in from  and by thousand  or  in from net interest income at december  was million compared to million at december  and million at december  the net interest margin on interest earning assets was in  in and in on a tax equivalent basis 
beginning in early through the end of  short term interest rates dropped basis points but recovered basis points in 
table of contents comparing the interest margin in to that in  the bank s interest margin has declined by basis points 
measuring the last three years  the bank s interest margin has decreased basis points 
management s interest rate risk strategies helped to mitigate the effects of rapidly declining and then increasing interest rates 
the average yield on assets in on a tax equivalent basis was  down basis points from while the cost of funds was  down basis points from  as annualized deposit costs reached their economic low in likewise  during  the bank s yield on earning assets declined basis points while its cost of funds was reduced by basis points 
the bank s balance sheet has traditionally been slightly liability sensitive  but as and progressed  management sought to become more evenly matched and perhaps slightly asset sensitive 
that is  management has sought to shift to a scenario where assets re price faster than liabilities 
therefore  in a rising rate environment  the bank s interest margin will tend to widen 
when rates fall rapidly as in the past three years  the bank s cost of funds hit an economic floor while its asset yields flatten out and become slightly more variable 
the net result is that management has been attempting to poise the bank s interest margin to increase as interest rates rise 
the ability of management to accomplish its objective is dependent largely on its ability to manage the cost of its transaction and savings accounts which accounted for of its average interest bearing liabilities in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was for  for and for the borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb  which are fixed rate  have prevented the bank s cost of funds from decreasing more rapidly in all three years 
the impact of the fixed rates on borrowings would have been more significant in had management not chosen to effectively hedge those rates with the million notional amount swap contract described in note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the swap contract reduced interest expense in by thousand 
management anticipates that the bank s cost of funds will be positively impacted over the next seven months as million of those fhlb borrowings mature and the borrowings can be replaced with lower cost funds 
considering the bank s yield on interest bearing assets of for  for and for  the impact of decreasing rates on asset yields was more pronounced in than in and even less significant in this suggests that the bank may have reached a plateau in its net interest margin 
as rates rose in the second half of the bank s net interest margin also began to expand 
this trend supports management s strategy of increasing asset sensitivity in order to create upside for net interest margin with increasing market rates 
additionally  when market rates were declining  management sought to implement interest rate floors on adjustable rate loans  thereby minimizing the negative impact of falling interest rates 
the following table shows  for the past three years  the relationship between interest income and interest expense and the average daily balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a rate of

the following table shows the relative impact on net interest income of changes in the annual average daily outstanding balances volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned rate by the bank on such assets and liabilities 
variances resulting from a combination of changes in rate and volume are allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each category

the increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in the volume of service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts have increased an average of over the last two years and most of that increase is due to insufficient funds charges and service charges on increased new account activity 
mortgage origination fees have decreased from to after a decrease of less than from to beginning in the last half of  the bank experienced a slowdown in mortgage refinance activity that management expected would not recover 
the refinance boom  which took place in part of and  has ended

income taxes  expressed as a percentage of earnings before income taxes the marginal tax rate  declined to in  from in and in the decline in marginal tax rate over the past three years is primarily attributable to tax credits and other tax advantaged instruments such as municipal securities purchased by the bank 
additionally  in october  the bank formed wgnb investments  inc  a nevada corporation  to manage  hold and trade securities of the bank which had the effect of reducing its state income tax liability in  and balance sheet overview for the years ended december  and general during  average total assets increased million  or  average deposits increased million  or  and average loans increased million   from average balances recorded in during  average total assets increased million  or  average deposits increased million  or  and average loans increased million  or  from amounts recorded in based on average balances  growth rates were greater in than in the percentage growth is more representative of the bank s historical growth rate than the percentage growth rate 
management believes that growth in was stalled by the recessionary period which began in the beginning in and continued through at least the first half of during that time  commercial enterprises declined to expand their businesses and individuals held off spending until the economic picture locally and nationally improved 
total assets at december   were million  representing a million  or increase from december  total deposits increased million  or  from to while total loans increased million  or  during as management attempted to channel excess liquidity into new loans 
loan demand rebounded in the last half of after a decline in the early part of the year 
loan demand remained robust in with much of the growth concentrated in the second half of the million of total loan 
table of contents growth in was funded with the investment of federal funds sold totaling million  an increase in deposits of million and borrowings from the fhlb of million 
the increase in deposits in is attributable to an increase in non interest bearing demand accounts of million  or  and an increase in time deposit accounts of million  or 
interest bearing demand accounts actually decreased million  or  in with most of that decrease occurring in december of the decline in interest bearing demand accounts in december  resulted from a reduction in public funds 
at the end of  certain public entities collect tax revenue and  typically  that liquidity remains deposited past year end 
in  those funds were disbursed before year end 
as indicated above  the bank funded its loan growth with liquidity that existed on its balance sheet and subsequently borrowed funds from the fhlb and attracted deposits as needed to its loan growth 
the bank began a campaign to increase time deposits through both local and national sources in mid and was successful in attracting funding with only minimal increase to its cost of funds 
total assets at december  were million  representing an million  or  increase from december  total deposits increased million  or  from to while total loans increased million  or  during as management attempted to invest its excess liquidity into loans 
during  federal funds sold decreased million while total loans increased million and investments available for sale and held to maturity increased million 
the decrease in federal funds sold and the increase in deposits primarily funded the loan and investment portfolio growth in during and  five denovo banks began their operations in or contiguous to our primary service area 
the competition for funding has increased significantly in as loan growth has outpaced deposit growth in carroll county 
the funding landscape has changed and  along with it  the bank s deposit strategy changed in in its almost year history  the bank relied on in market deposits to fund its balance sheet growth 
because of the continued development of the metropolitan atlanta and its movement westward  loan demand has preceded the actual movement of deposits 
management expects that this dynamic will continue and intends to expand its deposit gathering strategy towards greater use of wholesale or out of market funding sources 
investments the company s available for sale investment portfolio of million as of december  consisted primarily of debt securities  which provide the company with a source of liquidity  a stable source of income  and a vehicle to implement asset and liability management strategies 
the available for sale portfolio increased million  or  over available for sale securities at december  the company believes its investment portfolio provides a balance to interest rate and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet 
the portfolio also provides a vehicle for the investment of available funds and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain public deposits 
securities reported as available for sale are stated at fair value 
these securities may be sold  retained until maturity  or pledged as collateral for liquidity and borrowing in response to changing interest rates  changes in prepayment risk and other factors as part of the company s overall asset liability management strategy 
investment securities held to maturity are stated at amortized cost and totaled million at december   an increase of thousand  or  when compared to the prior year 
the increase is attributable to the purchase of banking industry issued trust preferred securities from various issuers across the united states and particularly the southeast 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity

additionally  some agency securities in the portfolio have call features 
the above analysis assumes that callable agencies will mature on their final maturity date 
the actual cash flow of agency securities may differ from this assumption 
yields on tax exempt securities are calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
loans loan concentrations are defined as aggregate credits extended to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or resident in the same geographic region  which would cause them to be similarly affected by economic or other conditions 
the bank  on a routine basis  evaluates these concentrations for purposes of policing its concentrations and making necessary adjustments in its lending practices to reflect current economic conditions  loan to deposit ratios  and industry trends 
the primary types of loans in the bank s portfolio are residential mortgages and home equity loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and consumer installment loans 
generally  the bank underwrites loans based upon the borrower s debt service capacity or cash flow  a consideration of past performance on loans from other creditors as well as an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan 
with some exceptions  the bank s 
table of contents general policy is to employ relatively conservative underwriting policies  primarily in the analysis of borrowers debt service coverage capabilities for commercial and commercial real estate loans  while emphasizing lower gross debt ratios for consumer loans and lower loan to value ratios for all types of real estate loans 
given the localized nature of the bank s lending activities  the primary risk factor affecting the portfolio as a whole is the health of the local economy in the west georgia area and its effects on the value of local real estate and the incomes of local professionals and business firms 
loans to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders of the company and to directors and officers of the bank are subject to limitations of the federal reserve  the principal effect of which is to require that extensions of credit by the bank to executive officers  directors  and ten percent shareholders satisfy certain standards 
the bank routinely makes loans in the ordinary course of business to certain directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates  and members of their immediate families 
in accordance with federal reserve guidelines  these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable transactions with others and do not involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features 
as of december   loans outstanding to directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates and members of their immediate families totaled million net of participations sold to other banks on a non recourse basis  which represented approximately of total loans as of that date 
as of december   none of these loans outstanding from the bank to related parties were on non accrual  past due  restructured or considered by management to be a potential problem loan

the company has an independent loan review function 
all loans are placed in loan grade categories which are consistent with those used by the bank s regulators 
all loans are constantly monitored by the loan officer and the loan review function for credit quality  consistency and accuracy 
through this grading process  the bank assures the timely recognition of credit risks 
in general  as credit risk increases  the level of the allowance for loan loss will also increase 
a formal allowance for loan loss adequacy test is performed at each month end 
specific amounts of loss are estimated on problem loans and historical loss percentages are applied to the balance of the portfolio using certain portfolio stratifications 
additionally  the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  regulatory examination results  and the existence of loan concentrations 
management s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans 
these evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  overall portfolio quality  and review of specific problem loans 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management uses a loan grading system that rates loans in eight different categories 
grades five through eight  which represent criticized or classified loans  are assigned allocations of loss based on management s estimate of potential loss that is generally based on historical losses and or collateral deficiencies 
loans graded one through four are stratified by type and allocated loss ranges based on historical loss experience for the strata 
the combination of these results is compared monthly to the recorded allowance for loan losses and material differences are adjusted by increasing or decreasing the provision for loan losses 
loans deemed to be impaired are evaluated individually to measure the probable loss  if any  in the credit 
management uses an internal loan reviewer who is independent of the lending function to challenge and corroborate the loan grading system and provide additional analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the future provisions for estimated loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and a change in the borrowers ability to repay 
in addition  regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such regulators may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
management of the company realizes the importance of maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through a professional loan review function and effective loan officer identification program  management believes it is able to recognize weaknesses in the loan portfolio in a timely manner 
early 
table of contents identification of deteriorating credit attributes allows management to take a proactive role in documenting an established plan to enhance the company s position and minimize the potential for loss 
through the problem loan identification program outlined above  management is able to identify those loans that exhibit weakness and classify them on a classified and criticized loan list 
the company s migration analysis assigns historical loss amounts to pools of loans according to classifications of risk ratings to calculate a general allowance to the overall portfolio 
in cases where significant weaknesses exist in a specific loan  a specific reserve is assigned to such loan in addition to the general allowance 
the company also evaluates the risks associated with concentrations in credit 
if it is necessary to assign an allowance related to concentrations of credit  the company adds a specific reserve related to such risks 
during the first quarter of  the bank accepted cash in the work out of nine classified loans that amounted to million and recorded a charge off in the amount of thousand 
the bank had no work outs of loans in the following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated table allowance for loan losses in thousands december  balance at beginning of year charge offs commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer loans total charge offs recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer loans total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs recoveries during the period to average loans outstanding ratio of allowance to average total loans non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets at december   were million  or  of total loans and other real estate owned compared to million  or  of total loans and other real estate owned at december  and million  or  of total loans and other real estate owned at december  the levels of non performing loans remain relatively low compared to the bank s peer group and its historical level

as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as non accrual generally when they are past due in principal or interest payments for more than days or it is otherwise not reasonable to expect collection of principal and interest under the original terms 
exceptions are allowed for day past due loans when such loans are well secured and in process of collection 
generally  payments received on non accrual loans are applied directly to principal 
the bank s loan review function monitors selected accruing loans for which general economic conditions or changes within a particular industry could cause the borrowers financial difficulties 
the loan review function also identifies loans with high degrees of credit or other risks 
the focus of loan review and management is to maintain a low level of non performing assets and return current non performing assets to earning status 
management is unaware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations

to meet these obligations  the bank keeps cash on hand  maintains account balances with its correspondent banks  and purchases and sells federal funds and other short term investments 
asset and liability maturities are monitored in an attempt to match these variables to meet liquidity needs 
it is the policy of the bank to monitor its liquidity to meet regulatory requirements and local funding requirements 
management believes that the bank s current level of liquidity is adequate to meet its needs

cash and cash equivalents amounted to million at december  which represented a decrease of million from december  the decrease was primarily attributable to net cash used by investing activities of million made up of million of increased loans and a million net increase in investment securities 
these cash flow uses were offset by net cash provided by financing activities which was primarily attributable to a net increase in deposits of million and million in fhlb borrowings

these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to the bank s customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time 
at december   the bank had issued commitments to extend credit of million through various types of commercial lending arrangements and additional commitments through standby letters of credit of million 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on its credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  commercial and residential real estate 
the company manages the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes 
because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
if needed to fund these outstanding commitments  the company has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available for sale or on a short term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions 
asset liability management it is the company s objective to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory  consistent level of profitability within the framework of established cash  loan  investment  borrowing and capital policies 
certain officers are charged with the responsibility for monitoring policies and procedures that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of the asset liability mix 
it is the overall philosophy of management to support asset growth primarily through growth of deposits and borrowing strategies  which minimize the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of the policy is to control interest sensitive assets and liabilities so as to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on earnings 
the asset liability mix is monitored on a regular basis 
a report reflecting the interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is prepared and presented to management and the asset liability management committee on at least a quarterly basis 
one method to measure a bank s interest rate exposure is through its repricing gap 
the gap is calculated by taking all assets that reprice or mature within a given time frame and subtracting all liabilities that reprice or mature within that time frame 
the difference between these two amounts is called the gap  the amount of either liabilities or assets that will reprice without a corresponding asset or liability repricing 
a negative gap more liabilities repricing than assets generally indicates that the bank s net interest income will decrease if interest rates rise and will increase if interest rates fall 
a positive gap generally indicates that the bank s net interest income will decrease if rates fall and will increase if rates rise 

table of contents the company has adopted the objective of achieving and maintaining a one year cumulative gap  as a percent of total assets  of between plus and minus 
on a consolidated basis  the company s one year cumulative gap was a positive of total assets at december  this position indicated that the company was exposed to the potential for decreased earnings if interest rates were to continue to decline in the next twelve months 
due to inherent limitations in traditional gap analysis  the company also employs more sophisticated modeling techniques to monitor potential changes in net interest income  net income and the market value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates  arising primarily from interest rate risk in the company s loan and investment portfolios  which can significantly impact the company s profitability 
net interest income can be adversely impacted where assets and liabilities do not react the same to changes in interest rates 
at year end  the estimated impact of an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in an increase in net interest income over a month period of  with a comparable decrease in interest rates resulting in a decrease in net interest income of 
management finds the above methodologies meaningful for evaluating market risk sensitivity  however  other factors can affect net interest income  such as levels of non earning assets and changes in portfolio composition and volume 
the following table summarizes the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that are expected to mature  prepay or reprice in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets or liabilities that mature or reprice during a particular period was determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due  and fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities are included in the periods in which they are anticipated to be repaid based on scheduled maturities  although the cash flows received often differ from scheduled maturities 
the company s savings accounts and interest bearing demand accounts now and money market deposit accounts  which are generally subject to immediate withdrawal  are included in the one year or less category  although historical experience has proven these deposits to be less interest rate sensitive over the course of a year and are subject to management s control

table of contents at december   the difference between the company s assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within one year was million 
the above chart indicates an excess of liabilities repricing or maturing within one year  thus a rise in interest rates would theoretically cause the company s net interest income to decrease 
however  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees or at different points in time to changes in market interest rates 
such is the case in analyzing now demand  money market and savings accounts  which are disclosed in the one year or less category 
those liabilities do not necessarily reprice as quickly or to the same degree as rates in general 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
changes in interest rates  prepayment rates  early withdrawal levels and the ability of borrowers to service their debt  among other factors  may change significantly from the assumptions made in the table 
impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the primary effect of inflation on the company s operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve implements a national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks  and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the federal reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the company and its results of operations are not predictable
