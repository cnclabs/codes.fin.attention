item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pyramid breweries inc is engaged in the brewing and sale of specialty beers and sodas and in restaurant operations 
the company currently sells its beverage products primarily in washington  oregon and california under the pyramid  mactarnahan s and thomas kemper brand names and operates five restaurants  under the pyramid alehouse and mactarnahan s taproom names 
the restaurants in seattle  washington  berkeley  california and portland  oregon are located adjacent to the main production facilities 
the other two restaurants  located in walnut creek and sacramento  california are primarily restaurants with a brewery capable of providing products for on site consumption 
for the year ended december   the company had gross revenues of  an increase of from the company s revenues consist of sales of beer and soda to third party distributors and retail sales of beer  soda  food  apparel and other items in its restaurants 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and of the company s net sales were sales of beer and soda to third party distributors  respectively 
total retail alehouse sales accounted for and of total net sales in and  respectively 
the company s sales volumes and selling prices are affected by several factors such as level of consumer demand in existing markets  sales in new distribution areas  availability of beer distributors in new and existing markets  and competitive factors  including the increase or decrease in the number of competing craft beers  new product introductions and promotional pricing 
sales in the craft beer industry generally reflect a significant degree of seasonality with the second and third calendar quarters reflecting stronger sales than in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors and the company anticipates that its operating margin will fluctuate as a result of many factors  including i lower sales volumes due to changes in demand and lower selling prices due to increased product availability  ii increased depreciation and other fixed and semi fixed operating costs as a percent of sales during periods when the company s breweries are producing below capacity  iii sales seasonality and competition  iv increased raw material or packaging costs  and v changes in the sales mix 
increased selling and promotional costs incurred as the company protects its business in existing markets and develops its business in new geographic areas may also cause operating margins and operating income to decrease 
the company sells its craft beers in bottles and kegs 
although bottled products normally sell for a higher per barrel selling price  gross margin on the company s draft products are typically higher as a percentage compared to bottled products 
changes in the proportion of sales of bottled and draft products therefore will affect the company s gross margin 
for and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s sales of craft beers were bottled products

per the asset purchase agreement  pyramid breweries inc acquired portland brewing company s brewery and alehouse for total consideration including transaction costs of approximately million  consisting of a combination of assumed liabilities  cash and pyramid common stock

the results of operations of the acquired assets of portland brewing company since july  to december  are included in pyramid s statement of operations for the year ended december  this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  which are subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
statements concerning future performance  developments or events  concerning potential sales  restaurant expansion  production capacity  pending agreements with third parties and any other guidance on future periods  constitute forward looking statements 
these statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as anticipate  believe  continue  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  might  plan

while we believe these expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections are reasonable  such forward looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control and which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from our stated expectations 
some important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in forward looking statements include increased competition from craft and imported beer producers as well as from national brewers with greater financial resources and more extensive distribution networks than ours  reductions in distribution options through our independent distributors  inability of the company to achieve anticipated cost reductions  changes in and compliance with governmental policies and regulations with respect to our products  competitive pressures that cause decreases in the selling prices of our products  declines in our operating margins  acquisitions that may adversely affect our financial condition  and the failure of either the third party brewers with which we contract or us to perform under our agreements

critical accounting policies to prepare financial statements that conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must select and apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company believes that its critical accounting policies and estimates include the following long lived assets impairment 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company s evaluation is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
long lived assets to be disposed of are evaluated in relation to the estimated fair value of such assets less the estimated costs to sell 
long lived assets are written down to their estimated net fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flow analysis in the event of an impairment 
beginning in the fiscal year  the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 accounting for income taxes 
if circumstances related to the company s ability to generate future us taxable income change  the company s evaluation of its ability to realize its deferred tax assets could materially change

throughout the year  the company s sales force engages in promotional activities with the company s distributor and retail customers 
in connection with financial statement preparation and other financial reporting  management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expenditures resulting from these activities 
actual expenditures incurred could differ from management s estimates and assumptions 
if management s estimates and assumptions differ from the actual promotional activities incurred a timing difference could result either understating or overstating the actual promotional activity expense in a subsequent period 
because of the nature of promotional activities and the historical trends used in management analysis  management does not consider the potential timing differences to be a significant risk in the financial statement presentation 
total costs incurred were million recorded as a reduction to gross sales 
allowance for keg deposits 
the company purchases kegs from vendors and records these assets in property  plant and equipment

r in the third quarter risk factors and forwarding looking statements the company does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
however this report does contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  which are subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
there are numerous important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made by the company 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
increasing competition 
the domestic market in which the company s craft beers compete is highly competitive for many reasons  including the continuing proliferation of new beers and brew pubs  efforts by regional craft brewers to expand their distribution  the introduction of fuller flavored products by certain major national brewers  and underutilized craft brewing capacity 
the company anticipates that intensifying competition from craft beer and imported beer producers and excess capacity in the craft beer segment may adversely impact the company s operating margins 
in addition  the larger national brewers have developed brands to compete directly with craft beers 
these national competitors have advantages such as lower production costs  larger marketing budgets  greater financial and other resources and more developed and extensive distribution networks than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to grow its volumes or be able to maintain its selling prices in existing markets or as it enters new markets 
access to markets 
most of the company s independent distributors are also distributors of national brewers  some of whom have used their greater influence and marketing resources to persuade those distributors to exclude the products of other breweries from their portfolios 
such actions by national brewers have the effect of reducing distribution options for the company s products 
in addition  many independent distributors are moving towards consolidation to improve profit margins 
although the company has not yet been negatively impacted by such events  it is possible that the company could effectively be denied access to a market or markets by the tactics of the national brewers and further consolidation of independent distributors 
in the states that comprise the majority of its sales  the company has the option to distribute its products directly to retailers and the company has previous experience in doing so 
however  there is no assurance that self distribution can be done in an economic manner over large territories 
government regulations 
the company s business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels  and its brewery and restaurant operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals  or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where the company intends to do business could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to conduct its business 
further  federal regulations prohibit  among other things  the payment of slotting allowances to retailers for beer products 
these regulations have the effect of preventing competitors with greater financial resources from excluding smaller brewers from retailers 
if these regulations were repealed or substantially modified  there would likely be a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
selling prices 
the future selling prices the company charges for its craft beer and other specialty beverages may decrease from historical levels due to increasing competitive pressures 
the company has and will continue to participate in price promotions with its wholesalers and their retail customers 
management believes that the number and frequency of the company s promotions may increase during variability of margins and operating results 
the company anticipates that its operating margins will fluctuate and may decline as a result of many factors  including i lower sales volumes and selling prices  ii increased depreciation and other fixed and semi fixed operating costs as a percent of sales during periods 
table of contents when the company s breweries are producing below designed capacity  iii increased raw material and packaging costs  iv changes in product mix and packaging  v increased transportation costs  vi increased sales from retail operations which may have a lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales than beer sales  and vii increased selling and promotional costs incurred as the company protects its business in existing markets 
increases in federal or state excise taxes and the impact of an increasing average federal excise tax rate as production increases may also cause a decline in the company s gross margins 
the company pays federal excise taxes on all beer sales and pays state excise taxes on beer sales occurring in various states at various tax rates 
the federal excise tax is per barrel on the first  barrels and per barrel exceeding  annually  as long as total annual sales are less than two million barrels 
the washington state excise tax is per barrel annually  oregon state excise tax is per barrel annually and the california state excise tax is per barrel annually 
acquisitions 
the acquisition of existing brewery and or restaurant facilities may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and financial condition 
the company may seek to selectively acquire existing facilities which requires identification of suitable acquisition candidates  negotiating acceptable acquisition terms and obtaining appropriate financing 
any acquisition pursued may involve risks including material adverse effects on operating results  costs of integrating the acquired business into the company operations  risks associated with entering into new markets  conducting operations where the company has limited experience or the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
future acquisitions  which may be accomplished through a cash purchase transaction or the issuance of equity securities  or a combination could result in potentially dilative issuances of securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm the business and financial condition 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such an event  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
impact of inflation although the company has not attempted to calculate the effect of inflation  management does not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the future  increases in costs and expenses  particularly energy  packaging  raw materials and labor costs may have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such cost increases cannot be passed along to its customers 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has not and does not currently have any intention to hold any derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
also  the company does not have any outstanding variable rate debt and does not enter into significant transactions denominated in foreign currency 
the company s direct exposure to risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments is not material 
the company does maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheets at fair value 
at any time  a rise or decrease in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of the investment portfolio 
the company currently does not hedge interest rate exposures
