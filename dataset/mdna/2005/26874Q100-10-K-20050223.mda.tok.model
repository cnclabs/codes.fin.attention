item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ensco international incorporated and subsidiaries ensco or the company is an international offshore contract drilling company with a fleet of drilling rigs  including jackup rigs  seven barge rigs  three platform rigs and one semisubmersible rig 
the company s offshore contract drilling operations are integral to the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas and the company is one of the leading providers of offshore drilling services to the international oil and gas industry 
the company drills and completes oil and gas wells under contracts with major international  government owned and independent oil and gas companies 
the drilling services provided by the company are conducted on a day rate contract basis  under which the company provides its drilling rigs and rig crews and receives a fixed amount per day for drilling wells 
the customer bears substantially all of the ancillary costs of constructing the wells and supporting drilling operations  as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the wells 
financial operating results in the offshore contract drilling industry have historically been very cyclical and are primarily related to the demand for drilling rigs and the available supply of rigs 
demand for rigs is directly related to the regional and worldwide levels of offshore exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies  which is beyond the control of the company 
offshore exploration and development spending may fluctuate substantially from year to year and from region to region 
such spending fluctuations result from many factors  including demand for oil and gas  regional and global economic conditions and expected changes therein  political and legislative environments in the us and other major oil producing countries  production levels and related activities of opec and other oil and gas producers  and the impact that these and other events have on the current and expected future pricing of oil and natural gas 
the supply of drilling rigs is limited and new rigs require a substantial capital investment and a long period of time to construct 
in addition  it is time consuming and costly to move rigs between markets 
accordingly  as demand changes in a particular market  the supply of rigs may not adjust quickly  and therefore the utilization and day rates of rigs could fluctuate significantly 
since factors that affect offshore exploration and development spending are beyond the control of the company and rig demand can change quickly  it is difficult for the company to predict industry conditions or trends in operating results 
periods of low demand result in excess rig supply  which generally reduces rig utilization levels and day rates  periods of high demand tighten rig supply  generally resulting in increased rig utilization levels and day rates 

table of contents the company s drilling rigs are deployed throughout the world  with drilling operations concentrated in the major geographic regions of north america  europe africa  asia pacific which includes asia  the middle east and australia and south america caribbean 
the company competes with other offshore drilling contractors on the basis of price  quality of service  operational and safety performance  equipment suitability and availability  reputation and technical expertise 
competition is usually on a regional basis  but offshore drilling rigs are mobile and may be moved from one region to another in response to demand 
business environment the company s domestic offshore drilling operations are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
the us natural gas market and trends in oil and gas company spending largely determine domestic offshore drilling industry conditions 
the exploration and development spending budgets of most companies drilling in the gulf of mexico were reduced from historical levels during and demand for jackup drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico was significantly lower than in prior years 
while some jackup rigs departed the gulf of mexico for international service during  the supply of jackup rigs remained in excess of demand 
as a result of this imbalance  day rates were significantly lower in as compared to prior years 
during the first half of  demand for jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico decreased from the already reduced levels  as oil and gas companies focused more of their spending on international projects 
however  demand began to improve in the second half of  as the supply of jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico declined after some of the company s competitors mobilized rigs to international markets in response to contract opportunities 
day rates for gulf of mexico jackup rigs began to increase during the second half of  due primarily to the reduction in the supply of rigs 
the supply of jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico declined further during  as the company and some of its competitors mobilized additional rigs to international markets 
demand for jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico improved significantly during the second half of due to both the reduced supply of rigs and increased spending by oil and gas companies 
during the first six months of  jackup day rate trends were mixed  with day rates for the larger premium jackup rigs decreasing slightly from year end levels due to a modest oversupply of larger rigs  while day rates for smaller jackup rigs increased slightly from year end rates 
however  average day rates for jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico improved significantly during the second half of  as a result of the increased demand 
in europe  jackup rig demand and day rates during were improved over comparable levels in prior years  due primarily to increased spending by oil and gas companies 
however  during the latter part of both demand and day rates began to decline 
demand and day rates for jackup rigs in europe remained fairly stable over the first half of  as the impact of reduced spending by oil and gas companies was offset by a reduction in the supply of rigs after some of the company s competitors mobilized rigs to stronger markets 
during the second half of  reduced oil and gas company spending resulted in limited term work opportunities and jackup day rates in europe declined 
during  demand and day rates for jackup rigs in europe generally remained at reduced levels  but in recent months demand and day rates have begun to improve 

table of contents demand for jackup rigs in most asia pacific region markets has been strong during  and  as many of the major international and government owned oil companies increased spending in those markets 
day rates for asia pacific jackup rigs improved during much of as a result of the increased demand 
however  asia pacific region day rates remained relatively stable over the course of and  as the company and some of its competitors mobilized additional rigs to the region in response to the increased demand 
results of operations in may  the company transferred three rigs ensco  ensco and ensco to keppel fels limited kfels as partial payment for the construction of a new high performance premium jackup rig that is scheduled for delivery in late or early the results of operations of ensco  ensco and ensco have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in april  the company sold its vessel marine transportation fleet 
the results of operations of the marine transportation fleet have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for each of the years in the two year period ended december  in august  the company completed its merger with chiles offshore inc chiles  which was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  with the company treated as the acquirer 
the company s financial statements include the operating results of chiles from the august  acquisition date 
the acquired chiles operations consisted of a fleet of five high performance premium jackup rigs  including two rigs operating in the gulf of mexico  one rig operating offshore australia  one rig operating offshore trinidad and tobago  and one rig under construction that subsequently entered service in the gulf of mexico during december 
table of contents the company s consolidated operating results for each of the years in the three year period ended december   are as follows in millions revenues operating expenses contract drilling depreciation and amortization impairment of assets general and administrative operating income other expense  net provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations 

net income in  net income for the company decreased by million  or  and operating income decreased by million  or  as compared to these decreases are due primarily to reduced utilization and average day rates for the europe africa jackup rigs and ensco  partially offset by increased average day rates for the north america jackup rigs and increased operating days for the asia pacific jackup rigs 
in  net income for the company increased by million  or  and operating income increased by million  or  as compared to these increases are due primarily to a million impairment charge in relating to the company s venezuela based assets and the addition of the five rigs obtained as part of the chiles acquisition during the third quarter of approximately million of the million increase in operating income is attributable to the five rigs acquired from chiles

the company anticipates the majority of its cash flow in the near to intermediate term will continue to be invested in the expansion and enhancement of its fleet of drilling rigs 
as a substantial majority of such expenditures are elective  the company expects to be able to maintain adequate liquidity throughout future business cycles through the deferral or acceleration of its future capital investments  as necessary 
accordingly  while future operating cash flow cannot be accurately predicted  management believes its long term liquidity will continue to be funded primarily by operating cash flow 
market risk the company has net assets and liabilities denominated in numerous foreign currencies and uses various methods to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company predominantly structures its drilling contracts in us dollars  which significantly reduces the portion of the company s cash flows and assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also employs various strategies  including the use of derivative instruments  to match foreign currency denominated assets with equal or near equal amounts of foreign currency denominated liabilities  thereby minimizing exposure to earnings fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company utilizes derivative instruments to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding to exchange million us dollars for australian dollars  great britain pounds and euros  all of which mature during the next months 
based on a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the net unrealized loss associated with the company s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and related foreign currency exchange contracts as of december  would approximate million 

table of contents the company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the company occasionally uses interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the variable interest rate on debt to a fixed rate or the fixed rate on debt to a variable rate  and interest rate lock agreements to hedge against increases in interest rates on pending financing 
at december   the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements or interest rate lock agreements 
in connection with the acquisition of chiles on august   the company obtained million notional amount of outstanding treasury rate lock agreements that were scheduled to mature in october upon acquisition  the company designated approximately million notional amount of the treasury rate lock agreements as an effective hedge against the variability in cash flows of million of marad guaranteed bonds the company intended to issue in october the company deemed the remaining million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements obtained in the chiles acquisition to be speculative in nature 
the company subsequently settled the million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements deemed as speculative in october million and june million 
the company settled the million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements designated as an effective hedge in october in connection with the pricing and subsequent issuance of the marad bonds 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the company utilizes derivative instruments and undertakes hedging activities in accordance with its established policies for the management of market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
management believes that the company s use of derivative instruments and related hedging activities do not expose the company to any material interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  credit risk or any other market rate or price risk 

table of contents outlook changes in industry conditions and the corresponding impact on the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted because of the short term nature of many of the company s contracts and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other factors that impact oil and gas drilling and expenditure activity  rig utilization and day rates 
whether recent levels of regional and worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling and drilling activity will increase  decrease or remain unchanged  is not determinable at this time 
accordingly  future rig demand and trends in average day rates and utilization levels are uncertain 
management s current plans and expectations relative to its major areas of operations and near term industry conditions are detailed below 
rig construction construction of ensco has been completed and the rig was delivered to the company on february  upon delivery of the rig  the company exercised its purchase option and acquired full ownership of ensco from its joint venture partner 
ensco is currently under mobilization to perform a one year contract offshore australia that is expected to commence in march ensco is under construction by kfels in singapore and remains on schedule for delivery in late or early ensco will be an enhanced kfels mod v b design modified to ensco specifications and a sister rig to ensco rig enhancements and relocations ensco is currently in a singapore shipyard for major enhancements and is projected to return to service in the asia pacific region during the second quarter of ensco is in a shipyard undergoing modifications in preparation for a three year contract to commence offshore saudi arabia in june ensco and ensco are in a shipyard undergoing enhancements and are projected to return to service in the gulf of mexico during february and april  respectively 
the company also plans to commence enhancement procedures on three additional gulf of mexico jackup rigs during  including two enhancements with projected shipyard durations of approximately four months each commencing in april and july  and a major enhancement with projected shipyard duration of nine months commencing in march 

table of contents two of the company s drilling rigs  the ensco jackup rig and ensco platform rig  sustained considerable damage during hurricane ivan in september the physical damage to the rigs  as well as the related removal  salvage and recovery costs  are covered by insurance  subject to an aggregate escalating deductible of up to million 
damage to ensco is substantial and an analysis to determine the full extent of such damage has not been completed 
it is possible ensco will be declared a constructive total loss  as defined by the company s insurance policies 
if this is the case  the company will surrender the rig and receive million of insurance proceeds  which will result in the recognition of a gain  as the insurance proceeds exceed the million carrying value of the rig 
if ensco is not declared a constructive total loss  the company plans to repair the rig and return it to service 
the company will not be able to estimate the amount of time necessary to complete repairs until the analysis of damages has been completed 
repair of the damage to ensco is nearing completion and the company expects the rig to return to service in late february north america as of february   all of the company s jackup rigs in the north america region not undergoing enhancement procedures are working 
the ensco  the company s deep water semisubmersible rig  is currently working and committed into the third quarter of of the company s three platform rigs  one is currently working  another is earning a standby rate while completing repairs caused by hurricane ivan and expected to return to service in late february  and one is idle 
the two platform rigs under contract are expected to work into the fourth quarter of the company s three platform rigs have experienced average utilization of over the previous five years  primarily as a result of reduced opportunities for deep well drilling contracts 
the company s platform rigs  which are all capable of completing  to  feet wells  are best suited for long term  deep well drilling applications where the platform rig components will stay in place for a substantial period of time 
the company s platform rigs currently compete against smaller  easier to mobilize and assemble  self erecting platform rigs for shallow well drilling 
the company is not able to predict when there will be a recovery of drilling activity that will require a sustained use of the class of platform rigs owned and operated by the company 
the company evaluated the carrying values of its platform rigs in december and determined such carrying values were not impaired 
the company will continue to perform such evaluations as circumstances dictate 
europe africa as of february   all of the company s jackup rigs in the europe africa region are working  with several rigs committed beyond the second quarter of the company expects some idle time during the first and second quarters of  primarily for regulatory inspections and remedial procedures  repairs and minor improvements and upgrades 

table of contents asia pacific as of february   all of the company s jackup rigs in the asia pacific region are working except for ensco  ensco and ensco  all three of which are discussed above 
the company currently has substantial backlog in the asia pacific region  with in excess of  rig days under contract in and thereafter 
south america caribbean as of february   four of the company s six barge rigs located in venezuela are idle without work commitments 
ensco ii and ensco iii are working under contracts scheduled to be completed in october and march  respectively 
due to the continuing political and economic instability in venezuela  the company believes the timing of a recovery of drilling activity in venezuela is uncertain 
the company evaluated the carrying values of its barge rigs in december and determined such carrying values were not impaired 
the company will continue to perform such evaluations and monitor the situation in venezuela  as circumstances dictate 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the company s management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the company s management in their application  have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies are those related to property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and income taxes 
property and equipment at december   the carrying value of the company s property and equipment totaled  million  which represents of total assets 
this carrying value reflects the application of the company s property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgments by management relative to the capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of the company s rigs 

table of contents the company develops and applies property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to appropriately and consistently capitalize those costs incurred to enhance  improve and extend the useful lives of its assets and expense those costs incurred to repair or maintain the existing condition or useful lives of its assets 
the development and application of such policies requires judgment and assumptions by management relative to the nature of  and benefits from  expenditures on company assets 
the company establishes property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to depreciate or amortize its assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments used by management in determining the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of its assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives of the company s rigs  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions  and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of its rigs on a periodic basis  considering operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
the company s most recent change in estimated useful lives occurred in january  when the company extended the useful lives of its drilling rigs by an average of five to six years 
the company s fleet of jackup rigs as of december   which comprise in excess of of both the gross cost and net carrying amount of the company s property and equipment at december   is depreciated over useful lives ranging from to years 
the company s semisubmersible rig is depreciated over a year useful life and its seven barge rigs are depreciated over year useful lives 
the company s three platform rigs are depreciated over useful lives ranging from to years 
the following table provides an analysis of estimated increases and decreases in depreciation expense that would have been recognized for the year ended december   for various assumed changes in the useful lives of the company s drilling rigs effective january  increase decrease in useful lives of the company s drilling rigs estimated increase decrease in depreciation expense that would have been recognized in millions 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company evaluates the carrying value of its property and equipment  primarily its drilling rigs  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable 
generally  extended periods of idle time and or inability to contract rigs at economical rates are an indication that a rig may be impaired 
however  the offshore drilling industry is highly cyclical and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for significant periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change 
likewise  during periods of supply and demand imbalance  rigs are frequently contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods of time until demand comes back into balance with supply 
impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual rigs  groups of rigs  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or rigs in a certain geographic location 
the company s rigs are mobile and may be moved from markets with excess supply  if economically feasible 
the company s jackup rigs and semisubmersible rig are suited for  and accessible to  broad and numerous markets throughout the world 
however  there are fewer economically feasible markets available to the company s barge rigs and platform rigs 
the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify reporting units and estimate the fair value of those units as of the testing date 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  its goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the company estimates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess 
in the event the company disposes drilling rig operations that constitute a business  goodwill would be allocated in the determination of gain or loss on sale 
based on the company s test performed as of december   there was no impairment of goodwill 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
in most instances they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by the company s drilling rigs  and are based on management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and operations  as well as management s estimates of future expected utilization  contract rates  expense levels and capital requirements of the company s drilling rigs 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments used by management in the application of the company s asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational  industry  economic and political environments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  judgments and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

table of contents certain of the company s barge rigs and platform rigs have experienced extended periods of idle time in one or more previous years 
the company has evaluated the carrying values of these rigs on several occasions in recent years and has previously recognized impairment charges on all of its barge rigs located in venezuela 
an evaluation of the expected future cash flows of six barge rigs in venezuela and five platform rigs in the gulf of mexico in december determined the carrying value of each rig was not impaired 
in december  the company obtained third party fair value appraisals for five of the six barge rigs  which also indicated their carrying values were not impaired 
the sixth barge rig was under contract days during  with the majority of the idle time attributable to regulatory inspection and remedial procedures  and is currently under a long term contract that is scheduled for completion in october in may  the company transferred two of the five platform rigs to a shipyard in connection with the ensco construction agreement 
the transfer was treated as a sale and the fair value of the two rigs approximated their carrying value 
of the three remaining platform rigs  two are currently under contracts that are expected to run into the fourth quarter of there is no goodwill associated with the company s barge rigs or platform rigs 
income taxes the company conducts operations and earns income in numerous foreign countries and is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries  as well as us federal and state tax laws 
at december   the company has a million net deferred income tax liability and million of accrued liabilities for income taxes currently payable 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of the company s income tax accounting policies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of sfas carryforwards and tax credits are assessed for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a more likely than not determination 
a us deferred tax liability has not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is not practicable to estimate 
should the company elect to make a distribution of foreign earnings  or be deemed to have made a distribution of foreign earnings through application of various provisions of the internal revenue code  it may be subject to additional us income taxes 
the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretation of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes  especially those involving the deployment of tax planning strategies  may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations 

table of contents the company operates in many jurisdictions where tax laws relating to the offshore drilling industry are not well developed 
in jurisdictions where available statutory law and regulations are incomplete or underdeveloped  the company obtains professional guidance and considers existing industry practices before deploying tax planning strategies and meeting its tax obligations 
tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through a negotiation process 
while the company has historically not experienced significant adjustments to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns  there can be no assurance that significant adjustments will not arise in the future 
in addition  there are several factors that could cause the future level of uncertainty relating to the company s tax liabilities to increase  including the following during recent years the portion of the company s overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing and the company currently anticipates this trend will continue 
in order to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently  the company s subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates  which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and frequently are reviewed by tax authorities 
the company may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed and it may be difficult to secure adequate professional guidance 
tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties change frequently  requiring the company to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes
