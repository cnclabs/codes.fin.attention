our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements that are included in part iv  item of this form k  beginning on page of this report 
executive summary savvis is a leading global provider of outsourced information technology services  delivering secure  reliable  and scalable hosting  network services  and digital content management 
our strategic approach combines the use of virtualization technology  a utility services model  and an automated software management and provisioning system 
this allows customers to focus on their core business while we ensure the quality of their it infrastructure 
services although we operate in one operating segment separated by geographic location  the following briefly describes our services by revenue category managed ip vpn our managed ip vpn include revenues primarily from our ip vpn  called intelligent ip sm networking  which is a high performance network platform for a client s managed voice  video  and data applications 
hosting hosting revenues include revenues from our managed hosting solutions which combine hosting network  computing and storage services to provide customers with application platforms that deliver better performance  higher availability and lower total cost than found with traditional service provider models

other network services our other network services are comprised of internet access  managed voice services  private line services and layer vpns 
these services can be purchased individually or in combination with our other services 
digital content management revenues from digital content management  or media services  include our wam net services  digital media services and content delivery network cdn services 
our wam net services are custom designed for the media industry and provide a shared managed infrastructure tied to applications that streamline process and workflow around the creation  production and distribution of digital content 
our cdn services enable customers to distribute their web content easily  rapidly and reliably to end users from a global network of servers located at the edge of the internet 
our industry solutions and professional services combine the services listed above  and revenues from these services are recorded in each of the categories of services above 
business trends our financial results continue to be affected primarily by competition in our industry 
we expect competitive factors in our industry to continue to affect the prices for our services and our results of operations 
prices for telecommunication services  including the services we offer  have decreased significantly over the past several years  and we expect to continue to see decreases for the foreseeable future 
to some extent  the impact of lower prices that we charge our customers has been offset by lower costs incurred by us to provide the service 
price pressure  however  varies by product  with unmanaged bandwidth services experiencing significant price pressure 
in contrast  managed ip vpn services have enjoyed more stable pricing  and we believe these services will continue to maintain stability as we provide more value added services to our customers 
we have also addressed industry wide price competition and price decreases by broadening the range of services that we offer 
in  we began offering cdn services  colocation services  carrier wholesale services  consulting services  and an expanded portfolio of managed security services as a result of our acquisition of the assets of cable wireless usa  inc and cable wireless internet services  inc together with the assets of certain of their affiliates cable wireless america or cwa 
we also introduced our suite of virtual utility managed services  our industry solutions services such as retail avenue  a suite of it solutions targeted at the retail industry  and managed utility applications  such as our intelligent messaging 
the addition of cwa s internet protocol ip network and cwa s hosting assets to our existing ip network and hosting business enabled us to expand the range of ip network services  consulting and infrastructure services that we could offer our customers 
in evaluating our financial results and the performance of our business  our management reviews our revenues  gross margin and operating income 
in addition  management evaluates these indicators on a quarterly and annual basis in order to have a complete understanding of business trends 
below is a quarterly and annual overview of these indicators in thousands pro forma three months ended march  three months ended march  three months ended june  three months ended september  three months ended december  twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenue gross margin loss from operations results reported as if the cwa acquisition and related financing occurred on january  revenue historically  we have been heavily dependent on two of our largest customers  reuters and telerate 
together they comprised of our revenue by the end of in addition to these customers  most of our remaining revenue came from our managed ip vpn services 
however  after we acquired cwa in march  our revenue profile changed dramatically 
reuters and telerate were only of our revenue for the fourth quarter ending december  moreover  the acquisition increased our revenue from hosting services 
hosting services are now approximately twice our managed ip vpn revenue  comprising over of our total revenue 
our revenue grew by compared with the year ended december  as discussed in more detail below  this growth is primarily attributed to revenue from the acquisition of cwa 
for the fourth quarter of  our revenue decreased approximately compared to the third quarter of this was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from reuters and telerate and revenues from content delivery network traffic 
in the fourth quarter of  reuters announced that it was in discussions with a telecommunications provider to secure a long term agreement for the provision of network services and to divest its interest in a network services company that directly competes with us and that was formed to be reuters preferred network partner 
in the fourth quarter of  reuters also announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire telerate for cash and all of the capital stock of our company owned by reuters  which as of december  is approximately of the outstanding voting stock 
we cannot predict at this time what effect these possible transactions will have on our business if completed or if not completed 
however  we expect our revenues from reuters and telerate to continue to decrease due to lower spending commitments under our contracts with them 
we plan to offset this decrease and increase our revenue through a number of initiatives  including growing the number of people in our direct sales force and improving their productivity by increasing sales force automation and providing more sales support in terms of engineering and product expertise  pursuing alternative channels  such as developing partnerships with systems integrators  application service providers asps  and competitive local exchange carriers clecs  reducing churn of our existing customer base as a result of disconnects and price erosion by implementing a number of specific campaigns to target at risk customers and minimize churn  and given our product breadth and extensive customer base  exploring opportunities to sell additional services to existing customers 
gross margin another indicator that we use to evaluate the business is gross margin 
we define gross margin as total revenue less data communications and operations expenses 
the improvement of the gross margin throughout reflects the efforts to rationalize the network operations and obtain synergies from the cwa acquisition 
loss from operations loss from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended this increase in our net loss is primarily due to million in expenses incurred in the integration of cwa and a million increase in depreciation  amortization and accretion expenses 
we partially offset this increase by reducing a portion of our expenses during by achieving anticipated synergies through the integration of the cwa operations  including combining offices and eliminating redundancy within our operations 
we expect our expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues as we complete our integration of cwa 
for example  integration expenses decreased from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of we plan to continue to review and evaluate our business to identify operational efficiencies and to reduce costs in order to improve our cash flow and results of operations for the future 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations and financial position 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
valuation of long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of our long lived assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires us to review for impairment our long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
significant factors  which would trigger an impairment review  include the following significant negative industry trends  significant changes in technology  significant underutilization of assets  and significant changes in how assets are used or are planned to be used 
when such an event occurs  management estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
these impairment evaluations involve estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
management utilizes an expected present value technique  which uses a risk free rate and multiple cash flow scenarios reflecting the range of possible outcomes  to estimate fair value of the asset 
actual useful lives and cash flows could differ from those estimated by management using these techniques  which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
there were no asset impairment charges in and we recognized asset impairment charges of million in primarily related to equipment with carrying value above its estimated fair market value 
intangibles management accounts for the identified intangible assets acquired in various transactions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and statement of accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
our intangible assets were acquired through the wam net transaction or the cwa acquisition and  as such  were valued based on their estimated fair value relative to the estimated fair value of net assets received in these transactions 
identifiable intangible assets include patents  customer relationships  software  and peering agreements 
useful lives of these specifically identified intangible assets are eleven to fifteen years for patents  three to four years for customer relationships  five years for software and seven years for peering agreements 
at december  and  the identified intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition revenue consists primarily of revenue from managed ip vpn  hosting  other network services  and digital content management 
revenue is recognized when earned over the term of the related contract or as services are delivered 
installation fee revenue and the associated installation costs are deferred in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
such deferred revenue and costs are recognized into revenue and data communications and operations costs in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight line basis over periods of approximately two years  the estimated average life of a customer contract 
for all periods  any services billed and payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period such services are earned 
adjustments for estimated credits to be issued are recorded as a reduction in revenue and accounts receivable based on historical credits issued and known disputes 
amounts paid by reuters in that related to the buy down of portions of their minimum revenue commitments have been accounted for as deferred revenue and are being recognized into revenue through september the remaining term of their network services agreement with us 
allowance for credits and uncollectibles we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer information 
our policy for determining delinquent status is based on how recently payments have been received 
an estimate of service credits to be issued is also maintained based on our historical experience and our knowledge of any specific service interruptions 
as of december  and  our allowance for credits and uncollectibles was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective july   which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  only recognizes compensation cost for employee stock options to the extent that options have been issued below the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of statement s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
purchase accounting for cwa acquisition we acquired cwa in march the fair value of acquired assets was determined with the assistance of valuation experts 
the preliminary purchase price of million was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of assets acquired 
we also acquired significant liabilities requiring management to estimate the amount to ultimately be paid on these liabilities 
the liabilities we assumed include adjustments to properly reflect the fair market value of long term facility leases million  the idle capacity related to a long term iru operations  maintenance and power contract million  the cost of leased facilities that will remain idle million  and the obligation to rehabilitate the long term lease spaces at varying lease termination dates million 
management utilized an expected present value technique which utilized our incremental borrowing rate and expected cash flow scenario to estimate the fair value of the liability 
actual cash flows could differ from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our results of operation and financial position 
equity instruments management valued the series b preferred stock warrants as a convertible security 
we utilized the services of an external valuation expert to ascertain the fair value of the series b preferred stock warrants 
determining the fair value of these instruments required the use of certain assumptions 
if these assumptions differ from actual results  the valuation could be materially different 
operating leases we have various operating leases for facilities and equipment 
equipment lease terms are approximately three years  and the facility leases range from three to twenty years 
these facility leases include rent increases and  in certain cases  rent holidays 
any applicable rent increases or rent holidays are recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the expected useful life or the initial lease term of the applicable lease 
as of december   future minimum lease payments under these facility and equipment leases are approximately million 
rent expense under operating leases for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance on tax loss carry forwards and other potential tax benefits according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as a result  to the extent that we realize those benefits in future periods  they will favorably affect net income 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets because the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
at december   we had approximately million in united states net operating loss carry forwards expiring between and  of which approximately million is subject to the section limitation of the internal revenue code

generally  depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the useful life of the associated asset 
subsequent to the cwa acquisition  accretion expenses related to the aging of the discounted present value of various liabilities including adjustments for contracts are included in this line item

results of operations the historical financial information included in this form k will not reflect our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  executive summary of results of operations our revenues increased in primarily as a result of the addition of the cwa business  which outpaced declines in services provided to reuters and telerate

revenues year ended december  in thousands dollar change percent change diversified revenue managed ip vpn hosting other network services digital content management total diversified revenue reuters and telerate total revenue revenue 
revenue was million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  the acquisition of cwa resulted in a significant increase in our customer base and impacted all categories of diversified revenue 
diversified managed ip vpn revenues increased million  or  to million compared to million for this growth was primarily attributed to new sales activity from the legacy savvis business and only marginally impacted by the acquisition 
diversified hosting revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in  due primarily to growth from the cwa acquisition 
other network services includes the legacy savvis and cwa internet access revenues and cwa private line services which increased million or to million in  compared to million for digital content management revenues include cdn revenues and the revenues from wam net customers  which increased million from the previous year 
digital content management revenue includes approximately from a single customer  which we expect to decline in growth in other network services and digital content management was primarily due to the acquisition and acquired business offerings 
reuters and telerate revenues were million in the twelve months ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the twelve months ended december  the decline represents a reduction in services provided  pricing reductions  and a reduction in reuters minimum purchase obligation with us 
data communications and operations exclusive of non cash equity based compensation  depreciation  amortization  and accretion 
data communications and operations expenses were million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  from million in the increase in these costs was primarily related to the cwa acquisition to support the acquired revenue resulting in increases in each functional expense item including personnel costs  network expenses  facility rent  and facility maintenance 
furthermore  gross margin was million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to in the current year  compared to reported in primarily due to the lower gross margin of the acquired cwa business 
throughout  as the legacy businesses were more fully integrated  the gross margin percentage increased 
first quarter of reflected gross margin of with only one month of cwa activity 
second quarter of was  the lowest margin of the year  reflecting a full quarter of the cwa business lines and significant integration yet to be achieved 
third quarter results included a gross margin of  and fourth quarter reflected the highest of the year with gross margin 
the fourth quarter results indicate significant benefit of integration and cost rationalization activities 
sales  general and administrative exclusive of non cash equity based compensation 
sales  general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for this increase is primarily attributable to the cwa acquisition resulting in increases in personnel costs  commissions  temporary labor  provisions for bad debt  property taxes  and facility maintenance to support the growth in the business 
sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were for as compared to of revenue in sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were significantly impacted by the cwa acquisition 
the amounts as percentages of revenue by sequential quarter throughout were   and 
this progressive improvement reflects the realization of synergy activities and a disciplined approach to removing costs from the acquired business 
the percentage decrease from prior year also reflects the increased revenue base without adding a proportionate amount of costs 
integration costs 
integration costs were million during the twelve months ended december  included in these costs were million for consulting services related to integration  million for payroll costs and stay bonuses  million for specific contract costs enumerated in the cwa asset purchase agreement  and million for pop consolidation and network restructuring 
we expect these costs to be in a range of million in we are focused on completing the integration of savvis and cwa assets and operations during the first half of depreciation  amortization and accretion 
depreciation  amortization  and accretion expense was million and million for the twelve months ended december   and december   respectively 
subsequent to the cwa acquisition  accretion expenses relating to aging of the discounted present value of various liabilities including adjustments for long term fixed price contracts are included in this line item 
consistent with historical presentation  the amortization of intangibles and depreciation of long lived assets are reflected here 
the acquisition significantly increased the depreciable asset and intangible base as much of the value was assigned to irus  communications equipment  and leasehold improvements 
management expects depreciation  amortization  and accretion to be approximately million per quarter for  excluding the impact of additional capital expenditures 
non cash equity based compensation 
non cash equity based compensation amounted to million for the twelve months ended december  versus million in the decrease represents a decline in deferred compensation as the majority of the required compensation had been recognized by the end of  offset by the increase in compensation expense recognized from the vesting of two constellation ventures performance warrant tranches 
net interest expense and other 
net interest expense and other for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of million from the increase is a result of the subordinated notes issued during the first quarter of and the interest associated with the du pont fabros capital leases 
management expects interest expense will be approximately million per quarter in  under our current financing arrangements
