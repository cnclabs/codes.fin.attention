executive overview we are a leading independent distributor of financial services products primarily to high net worth individuals and growing entrepreneurial companies 
founded in  and commencing operations on january   we have grown internally and through acquisitions and  as of december   operate a national distribution network with over  producers in states and puerto rico operating through owned firms and over affiliated third party distributors 
we acquired  and firms in  and  respectively 
our operating results have improved from a net loss of million in to net income of million in as a result of new acquisitions and the growth of previously acquired firms  we have grown from a base of no revenue at the beginning of to million of revenue in our firms earn revenue that consists primarily of commissions and fees earned from the sale of financial products and services to their clients and incur commission and fee expense and operating expense in the course of earning revenue 
we pay management fees to non employee principals of our firms based on the financial performance of each respective firm 
we refer to revenue earned by our firms minus the expenses of our firms  including management fees  as gross margin 
management uses gross margin as a measure of the performance of the firms that we have acquired 
through acquisitions and internal growth  gross margin has grown from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in our gross margin is offset by expenses that we incur at the corporate level  including corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses have grown from million in to million in corporate and other expenses include general and administrative expenses  which are the operating expenses of our corporate headquarters 
general and administrative expenses have grown from million in to million in general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue declined from in to in acquisitions under our typical acquisition structure  we acquire of the equity of independent financial services products distribution businesses on terms that are relatively standard across our acquisitions 
to determine our 
table of contents acquisition price  we first estimate the annual operating cash flow of the business to be acquired based on current levels of revenue and expense 
for this purpose  we define operating cash flow as cash revenue of the business less cash and non cash expenses  other than amortization  depreciation and compensation to the business s owners or individuals who subsequently become principals 
we refer to this estimated annual operating cash flow as target earnings 
our acquisition price is a multiple generally in a range of five to six times of a portion of the target earnings  which we refer to as base earnings 
base earnings average of target earnings for all firms owned at december  in determining base earnings  our general rule is not to exceed an amount equal to the recurring revenue of the business 
by recurring revenue  we mean revenue from sales previously made such as renewal commissions on insurance products  commissions and administrative fees for ongoing benefit plans and mutual fund trail commissions and fees for assets under management 
we enter into a management agreement with principals and or certain entities they own 
under the management agreement  the principals and or such entities are entitled to management fees consisting of all future earnings of the acquired business in excess of the base earnings up to target earnings  and a percentage of any earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
we retain a cumulative preferred position in the base earnings 
to the extent earnings of a firm in any year are less than base earnings  in the following year we are entitled to receive base earnings together with the prior years shortfall before any management fees are paid 
additional purchase consideration is often paid to the former owners based on satisfying specified internal growth thresholds over the three year period following the acquisition 
substantially all of our acquisitions have been paid for with a combination of cash and our common stock  valued at its then fair market value 
we require our principals to take typically at least of the total acquisition price in our common stock  however  through december   principals have taken on average approximately of the total acquisition price in our common stock 
the following table shows acquisition activity in the following periods for the years ended december  in thousands  except number of acquisitions closed number of acquisitions closed consideration cash common stock other a a consists principally of the assumption of debt and capitalized acquisition costs 
although management believes that we will continue to have opportunities to complete a similar number of acquisitions as we have had in the past three years  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying and completing acquisitions 
see risk factors risks relating to our company we may be unsuccessful in acquiring suitable acquisition candidates  which could adversely affect our growth 
any change in our financial condition or in the environment of the markets in which we operate could impact our ability to source and complete acquisitions 

table of contents revenue we generate revenue primarily from the following sources life insurance commissions and estate planning fees 
insurance and annuity commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
first year commissions are calculated as a percentage of the first twelve months premium on the policy and earned in the year that the policy is originated 
in many cases  our firms receive renewal commissions for a period following the first year  if the policy remains in force 
some of our firms receive commissions for the settlement of life insurance policies 
these commissions are generally based on a percentage of the settlement proceeds received by the client 
our firms also earn fees for developing estate plans 
corporate and executive benefits commissions and fees 
our firms earn commissions on the sale of insurance policies written for benefit programs 
the commissions are paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintain its broker of record relationship with us 
our firms also earn fees for the development and implementation of corporate and executive benefit programs as well as fees for the duration that these programs are administered 
asset based fees are also earned for administrative services or consulting related to certain benefits plans 
financial planning and investment advisory fees and securities commissions 
our firms earn commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products as well as fees for offering financial advice and related services 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
in a few cases  incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the assets under management 
some of our firms charge flat fees for the development of a financial plan or a flat fee annually for advising clients on asset allocation 
our firms also earn additional compensation in the form of incentive revenue  from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  persistency and profitability of business generated by us from these three sources 
these forms of payments are earned both with respect to sales by our owned firms and sales by our network of over affiliated third party distributors 
nfpsi  our registered broker dealer and investment adviser  also earns commissions and fees on the transactions effected through it 
most principals of our firms  as well as many of our affiliated third party distributors  conduct securities or investment advisory business through nfpsi 
our affiliated third party distributors generated commission revenue through nfpsi of million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 
incidental to the corporate and executive benefits services provided to their customers  some of our firms offer property and casualty insurance brokerage and advisory services 
we earn commissions and fees in connection with these services 
some of our firms offer property and casualty insurance brokerage and advisory services 
we believe these services complement the corporate and executive benefits services provided to our clients 
commissions and fees are earned in connection with these services 
although our operating history is limited  we believe that our firms earn approximately to of their revenue in the first three quarters of the year and approximately to of their revenue in the fourth quarter 

table of contents expenses the following table sets forth certain of our expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated for the years ended december  total revenue cost of services commissions and fees operating expenses management fees gross margin corporate and other expenses general and administrative excludes stock based compensation stock based compensation amortization depreciation impairment of goodwill and intangible asset loss gain on sale of subsidiaries cost of services commissions and fees 
commissions and fees are typically paid to non principal producers  who are producers that are employed by or affiliated with our firms but are not principals 
when business is generated solely by a principal  no commission expense is incurred because principals are only paid from a share of the cash flow of the acquired firm through management fees 
however  when income is generated by a non principal producer  the producer is generally paid a portion of the commission income  which is reflected as commission expense of the acquired firm 
the use of non principal producers affords principals the opportunity to expand the reach of the business of a firm beyond clients or customers with whom they have direct contact 
in addition  nfpsi pays commissions to our affiliated third party distributors who transact business through nfpsi 
operating expenses 
our firms incur operating expenses related to maintaining individual offices  including compensating non producing staff 
firm operating expenses also include the expenses of nfpsi and of nfpisi  another subsidiary that serves our acquired firms and through which our acquired firms and our affiliated third party distributors access insurance and financial services products and manufacturers 
management fees 
we pay management fees to the principals of our firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of the firms they manage 
once we receive cumulative preferred earnings base earnings from a firm  the principals and or an entity the principals own receive management fees equal to earnings above base earnings up to target earnings 
an additional management fee is paid in respect of earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
for example  if base earnings equal of target earnings  we receive of earnings in excess of target earnings and the principal and or the entity receives 
management fees also include an accrual for certain performance based incentive amounts payable under our ongoing incentive program 
see business acquisition model performance incentives 
the ratio of management fees to gross margin before management fees is dependent on the percentage of total earnings of our firms capitalized by us  the performance of our firms relative to base earnings and target earnings  the growth of our firms in the periods after their first three years following acquisition  and the earnings of nfpisi and nfpsi  from which no management fees are paid 
because of our cumulative preferred position  
table of contents if a firm produces earnings below target earnings in a given year  our share of the firm s total earnings would be higher for that year 
if a firm produces earnings at or above target earnings  our share of the firm s total earnings would be equal to the percentage of the earnings capitalized by us in the initial transaction  less any additional management fees earned under ongoing incentive plans 
the following table summarizes the results of operations of our firms for the periods presented and shows our management fees as a percentage of gross margin before management fees for the years ended december  in thousands revenue commissions and fees cost of services commissions and fees operating expenses gross margin before management fees management fees gross margin management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees corporate and other expenses general and administrative 
at the corporate level  we incur general and administrative expense related to the acquisition of and administration of our firms 
general and administrative expense includes compensation  occupancy  professional fees  travel and entertainment  technology  telecommunication  advertising and marketing costs 
stock based compensation expense is disclosed separately 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses related to stock option grants under two incentive programs offered to the principals and certain employees of our earlier acquisitions 
as an inducement to the sellers of the first firms we acquired  the first incentive program allowed principals and certain employees to earn options at a fixed exercise price of per share 
the incentive program under which these stock options were granted expired  and therefore the stock based compensation expense related to this program has ended 
the second program  offered to the sellers of the next firms we acquired  allows principals and certain employees to earn options with a strike price equal to the price of our common stock at the time the options were earned 
the second incentive program expired at the end of in addition to these incentive programs  we have incurred stock based compensation expense for awards stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and directors 
stock options granted to employees through december  were accounted for under the intrinsic value based method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and have adopted the prospective method of transition 
under this method  the cost of awards granted to employees after january  are included in the determination of net income 
amortization 
we incur amortization expense related to the amortization of intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the firms we acquire may not continue to positively perform after the acquisition for various reasons  including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the products in which a firm specializes  the loss of key clients after the acquisition closed  general economic factors that impact 
table of contents a firm in a direct way and the cultural incompatibility of an acquired firm s management team with us 
in such situations  we may take impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
and reduce the carrying cost of acquired identifiable intangible assets including book of business  management contract and tradename and goodwill to their respective fair values 
management reviews and evaluates the financial and operating results of our acquired firms on a firm by firm basis throughout the year to assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with these firms 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  we use historical trends and we make projections regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the recoverably of the respective assets 
if a firm s goodwill and other intangible assets do not meet the recoverability test  the firm s carrying value will be compared to its estimated fair value 
the fair value is based upon the amount at which the acquired firm could be bought or sold in a current transaction between nfp and the principals and or the present value of the assets future cash flows 
the intangible assets associated with a particular firm may be impaired when the firm has experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated by an inability to produce at the level of base earnings for a period of four consecutive quarters and when the firm does not appear likely to improve its operating results or cash flows in the foreseeable future 
management believes that this is an appropriate time period to evaluate firm performance given the seasonal nature of many firms activities 
depreciation 
we incur depreciation expense related to capital assets  such as investments in technology  office furniture and equipment 
loss gain on sale of subsidiaries 
from time to time  we have disposed of acquired firms when these firms have not produced the expected results 
in these dispositions  we may realize a gain or loss on the sale of the subsidiary 
results of operations through acquisitions and internal growth  we have achieved revenue growth of  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
this growth was driven by our acquisitions  internal growth in the revenues of our acquired firms and the growth of nfpisi and nfpsi 
in  and  our firms had an internal revenue growth rate of  and  respectively 
as a measure of financial performance  we calculate the internal growth rate of the revenue of our firms 
this calculation compares the change in revenue of a comparable group of firms for the same time period in successive years 
we include firms in this calculation at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by us unless a firm has merged with another owned firm or has made a sub acquisition that represents more than of the base earnings of the acquiring firm 
with respect to two owned firms that merge  the combined firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the merger until the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by us of the most recently acquired firm participating in the merger 
however  if both firms involved in a merger are included in the internal growth rate calculation at the time of the merger  the combined firm continues to be included in the calculation after the merger 
with respect to the sub acquisitions described above  to the extent the sub acquired firm does not separately report financial statements to nfp  the acquiring firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the sub acquisition until the first fiscal quarter beginning one year following the sub acquisition 
sub acquisitions that represent less than of the base earnings of the acquiring firms are considered to be internal growth 
for further information about sub acquisitions  see business operations sub acquisitions 
with respect to dispositions  we include these firms up to the time of disposition and exclude these firms for all periods after the disposition 
the calculation described above is not adjusted for intercompany transactions that result in the same item of revenue being recorded by two firms 
in addition to internal growth in the revenue of our firms  we monitor acquired firm revenue  commission and fee expense and operating expense from new acquisitions as compared with existing firms 
for this purpose  a firm is considered to be a new acquisition for the twelve months following the acquisition 
after the first twelve 
table of contents months  a firm is considered to be an existing firm 
within any reported period  a firm may be considered to be a new acquisition for part of the period and an existing firm for the remainder of the period 
additionally  nfpsi and nfpisi are considered to be existing firms 
sub acquisitions that do not separately report their results are considered to be part of the firm making the acquisition  and the results of firms disposed of are included 
the results of operations discussions set forth below include analysis of the relevant line items on this basis

dividends on november   our board of directors declared its first quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock  or million  which was paid to shareholders on january  our dividend policy is determined by the board of directors 
dividends are declared after the board of directors considers our current available cash and cash equivalents and cash flow projections  which include earnings projections and anticipated cash payments for such items as funding operations  new acquisitions and capital spending 
there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future 
based on the most recent quarterly dividend declared of per share of common stock  the total annual cash requirement for dividend payments would be approximately million 
notes receivable we encourage succession planning in the management of our firms 
see business operations succession planning 
we have financed several purchases of interests in entities owned by principals or applicable management agreements to facilitate succession 
this financing is secured by management fees and  in many cases  is secured by other assets 
we advance management fees monthly to principals and or certain entities they own for up to nine months while monitoring the performance of the firms to determine if the actual earnings are on track to meet or exceed target earnings 
if earnings are not equal to or greater than pro rata target earnings  we cease to pay or reduce the management fee advance 
if an overadvance of a management fee exists  the principal and or such entities are expected to repay the advance within thirty days of the end of the calendar year 
if a principal and or such entities cannot repay the overadvance  we have allowed principals and or such entities to repay the advance over time 
in these cases  we have generally required the principals and or such entities to provide us with a note in an amount equal to the overadvance  secured by the principals and or such entities shares of our common stock 
in a few cases  we have disposed of firms 
we have also agreed  in a few cases  to reduce the levels of base earnings and target earnings in exchange for a payment from the principals of a firm 
in these situations  we typically take back a note for a portion of the cost of the disposition or the restructuring to the principal 

table of contents as of the following dates  notes receivable were as of december  in thousands notes from principals and or certain entities they own other notes receivable less allowance for uncollectible notes total notes receivable  net commitments and contingencies legal matters in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in lawsuits and other claims 
we consider these lawsuits and claims to be without merit and are defending them vigorously 
management believes  based upon consultation with legal counsel  that the resolution of these lawsuits or claims will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position 
in addition  the sellers of our firms typically indemnify us for loss or liability resulting from acts or omissions occurring prior to the acquisition  whether or not the sellers were aware of these acts or omissions 
several of the existing lawsuits and claims have triggered these indemnity obligations 
in addition  we  along with over twenty other unrelated insurance brokers and insurers  are defendants in four putative class actions filed by alleged policyholders 
two of these actions were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois  one was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california and one was filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey 
these actions assert  on behalf of a class of persons who purchased insurance through the broker defendants  claims arising from the conduct alleged in the new york attorney general s civil complaint against marsh inc and marsh mclennan companies  inc 
we dispute the allegations in these actions and intend to defend the actions vigorously 
additional complaints may be filed against us in various courts alleging claims arising from the conduct alleged in the new york attorney general s complaint 
our ultimate liability  if any  in the pending and possible future suits is uncertain and subject to contingencies that are not yet known 
some of our firms have received subpoenas and other informational requests from governmental authorities  including the new york attorney general s office  seeking information regarding compensation arrangements and related matters 
these appear to be similar to those received by other insurance intermediaries in their respective states 
given the current regulatory environment and the number of our firms operating in local markets throughout the country  it is possible that additional subpoenas or other inquiries will be received 
we have and will continue to cooperate fully with all governmental agencies 
in addition  we are conducting a voluntary internal review of the policies and practices of our insurance operations under the supervision of outside counsel 
the review includes an examination of the company s client disclosure practices  bidding procedures and contingent compensation arrangements 
our internal review has and will continue to result in significant legal and other costs 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of the internal review or the effect that any current or future regulatory activity will have on our business 
it is possible that we will become subject to further governmental inquiries and subpoenas and have lawsuits filed against us 
our ultimate liability  if any  in connection with these matters and any possible future such matters is uncertain and subject to contingencies that are not yet known

in some cases  contingent consideration may be payable after shorter periods 
as of december   acquisitions include contingent consideration features

these payments are expensed as employee compensation 
the minimum contingent payments which could be payable as purchase consideration and employee compensation in each year is zero 
the maximum contingent payment which could be payable as purchase consideration and employee compensation based on commitments outstanding as of december  consists of the following schedule of maximum contingent payments in thousands purchase consideration employee compensation total contingent consideration payable for acquisitions consummated in would generally be payable by the end of similarly  contingent consideration payable for acquisitions consummated in would be payable by the end of we currently anticipate using contingent consideration arrangements in future acquisitions  which would result in an increase in the maximum contingent consideration amount in and thereafter

all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and their related net assets and results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
certain of the acquisitions have provisions for contingent additional consideration based upon the financial results achieved over a multi year period 
this additional consideration is reflected as an increase in goodwill when results are achieved and the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
we allocate the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired to book of business  management contracts  trade name and goodwill 
we amortize intangibles related to book of business over a year period and a year period for management contracts 
prior to december   goodwill and tradename in connection with acquisitions before july  was amortized over a year period 
in accordance with sfas all amortization of goodwill ceased on january  intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization and consist of the following as of december  in thousands book of business management contracts trade name goodwill total intangible assets and goodwill

on january   we adopted sfas no 
 which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately disclosed from other intangible assets in the consolidated statement of financial condition  and no longer be amortized but tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests at least annually 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the transitional impairment test indicated there was no goodwill impairment as of january  the impact of adoption of sfas no 
resulted in million of goodwill and tradename no longer being amortized

we recognized an impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization of million  million  and million for the years ended as of december   and respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our remaining goodwill and other intangibles are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period
