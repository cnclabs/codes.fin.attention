overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing patient care by discovering  developing and commercializing novel small molecule  anti infective medicines for the treatment of hepatitis c virus  hepatitis b virus and certain bacterial infections 
to date we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of our proprietary drug discovery technologies  general research and development and preclinical and clinical testing of isatoribine  ana  which is an oral prodrug of isatoribine  and our other product candidates 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and our commencement of operations in and  as of december  our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we continue the development of ana for the treatment of hcv and hbv  fund our portion of the global development costs of ana  continue the development of our other hcv  hbv and antibacterial product candidates  further our research and development programs  advance our preclinical candidates into clinical development  establish a commercial infrastructure  commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval  and potentially in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are synergistic with our own 
during  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock for proceeds to us of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  each share of series c redeemable preferred stock and each share of convertible preferred stock was automatically converted into common stock 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the discovery and preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidates  ana  ana and our other product candidates 
in addition  research and development expenses include external costs such as fees paid to consultants  joint development collaboration costs and related contract research  and internal costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs  amortization of purchased technology and depreciation 
to the extent that costs are not tracked to a specific project  they are included in the captions unallocated direct internal costs and unallocated indirect internal costs and overhead in the table below 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands direct external costs isatoribine family of compounds  excluding ana ana ana other unallocated direct internal costs unallocated indirect internal costs and overhead total research and development at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our lead compounds  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we move other product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials 

table of contents clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are currently focused primarily on advancing the development of ana as a potential frontline therapy for hcv and hbv and ana for the treatment of hbv 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for administrative  finance  business development  human resources  legal and internal systems support personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include insurance costs  professional services and an allocated portion of facilities costs 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on revenue recognition in financial statements  and is based on the interpretations and practices developed by the sec 
many of our collaboration agreements contain multiple elements  including technology access fees  research funding  milestones and royalty obligations 
as of december   we do not have any revenue from royalties or significant milestone payments 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at the comparable level to before the milestone achievement and iii the milestone is not refundable or creditable 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront fees under our collaborations  such as technology access fees  are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
non refundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
amounts received for research funding are recognized as revenues as the services are performed 
amounts received for research funding for a specific number of full time researchers are recognized as revenue as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  finalized its tentative consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  drug development costs 
we account for certain compound manufacturing costs  clinical trial site costs  joint development costs and drug development costs by estimating the services incurred but not reported 
we review and accrue drug development costs based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment  completion of studies and other events 
these costs and estimates vary based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial and the length of treatment period for each patient as well as other factors 
drug development costs are subject to revisions as trials and studies progress to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
stock based compensation 
as permitted by the statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we account for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb pursuant to these guidelines  we measure the intrinsic value of the option or restricted stock award on its grant date as the difference between the purchase price of the restricted stock or the exercise price of employee stock options and the fair market value of our stock on the date of issuance or grant  and expense the difference if any  over the vesting period of the option or restricted stock award 
sfas no 
requires stock based compensation to be accounted for under the fair value method 
if we adopted sfas no 
to account for options granted to employees under our stock based compensation plans  our loss would have been materially impacted 
options or stock awards issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 and periodically remeasured in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  and recognized over the related service period 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report  which contains accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that we currently use and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the effective date of the standard is for periods beginning after june  upon adoption of this standard we expect that it will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenue 
we recorded revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the  decrease from to was primarily attributable to revenues derived from our collaborations with roche and amgen in compared to the million increase from to was primarily attributable to revenues derived from our collaborations with roche and amgen 
fluctuations in our collaboration related revenue from period to period are expected  as amounts recognized are dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to the timing of agreements  the timing of the workflow under the agreements and our collaborators abilities to provide us with the materials and information necessary for us to conduct our portion of the collaboration effort 
we expect our revenues to continue to fluctuate in future periods as we continue to enter into new agreements and perform activities under existing agreements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily a result of the following i the  option payment and the  licensing fee paid to lg life sciences in conjunction with the execution of our joint development and license agreement and ii an increase in drug development expenses of million related to drug development costs associated with the continued development of our isatoribine family of compounds and joint drug development costs associated with ana the million decrease from to was primarily a result of a decreases of million in external drug development expenses and million in lab supplies and outside lab services  partially offset by increases of  in personnel expenses as a result of hiring additional research and development personnel and an increase of  in facilities expenses related to the leasing of a second facility 
general and administrative expenses

the  decrease from to was primarily related to i lower legal fees of  and ii lower depreciation of  stock based compensation 
deferred compensation for stock options and stock awards granted have been determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
option or awards issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
and periodically remeasured in accordance with eitf and recognized over the service period 
in conjunction with the company s initial public offering  we reviewed our historical exercise prices through march  and  as a result  revised the estimate of fair value for all stock options granted subsequent to july  with respect to these options granted  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million  million  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  for the difference between the original exercise price per share determined by the board of directors and the revised estimate of fair value per shares at the respective grant dates

interest income 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the  increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income due to our higher average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balances as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from our initial public offering during april and may the  decrease in interest income from to was primarily attributable to lower prevailing interest rates associated with our lower average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balances during and interest expense 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense for the year ended december  was relatively consistent with the interest expense for the year ended december  the  increase from to was the result of a higher average balance outstanding under our long term debt during compared to as we received million of funding in late and an additional million of funding throughout other  net 
other  net was an expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in other  net for the years ended december   and was primarily the result of the loss on the disposal of assets related to the substantial dissolution of our german subsidiary in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and securities available for sale of million 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities as well as through equipment financing 
through december   we had received approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
in addition  as of december   we had financed through loans the purchase of equipment totaling approximately million  of which million in loans was outstanding at that date 
these obligations are secured by the purchased equipment and leasehold improvements  bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to and are due in monthly installments through october

we make payments to sites based upon the number of patients enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
for the years ended december  and  we had made aggregate payments of  and  respectively  to clinical sites in connection with our phase i clinical trials for isatoribine and phase i clinical trials for ana the majority of our clinical costs are related to the accrual and on going costs of patients entering our clinical trials as well as the manufacturing of compounds to be used in our clinical trials 
costs associated with clinical trials will continue to vary as the trials go through their natural phases of enrollment and follow up 
overview of financial position and future cash requirements our consolidated balance sheet as of december   compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of december   was impacted by the following the increase in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale of million was primarily the result of our initial public offering which was declared effective on march  through which we raised net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering were reduced by cash requirements for operations of the company 
the increase in accrued expenses of million was primarily the result of an increase in our costs associated on going drug development associated with both ana and ana in addition  we expect to continue to record costs associated with our joint development of ana with lg life sciences  ltd 
lgls 
in february  we obtained an exclusive option from lgls to enter into a joint development and license agreement for the development and commercialization of ana for the treatment of chronic hbv infection 
we paid  to lgls for this option 
on april   we announced that we exercised our option and had entered into a joint development and license agreement with lgls for the clinical development and commercialization of ana for the treatment of chronic hbv infection in north america  europe  japan and the rest of the world other than china  korea  india and countries in southeast asia 
under the terms of the agreement  we will share the costs for the global clinical development of ana with lgls 
during may  we paid a licensing fee of million to lgls 
in addition  we could be required to make additional milestone payments totaling up to million  subject to the attainment of product development and commercialization objectives 
we will pay royalties on any product sales in our sales territory to lgls and will receive royalties on any product sales in china from lgls 
for the year ended december   we have recorded  as a component of research and development expense  which represents our share of expenses incurred by lgls related to the clinical development of ana we have estimated these costs based on information provided to the company by lgls and based upon our understanding of the global clinical development plan for ana the increase in property and equipment of  was primarily the result of tenant improvements funded through lease incentives for our new corporate headquarters and research and development facility 
in addition  we paid million for a refundable security deposit on this facility  which is included as a component of other assets 

table of contents our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our preclinical development activities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the success of the commercialization of ana or ana  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with interest thereon  our existing cash  cash equivalents  and securities available for sale and revenues we may generate from our collaborations  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the beginning of however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and from equipment and leasehold improvement financing 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
