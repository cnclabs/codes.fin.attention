retail we own and operate retail stores both domestically and  on a smaller scale  internationally through three integrated retail formats 
our three distinct retail formats are as follows concept stores 
located in marquee street locations and high performing regional malls  concept stores promote awareness of the skechers brand and showcase a broad assortment of in season footwear styles 
the products offered in our concept stores are full price  in season and typically attract fashion conscious consumers 
factory outlet stores 
factory outlet stores are generally located in manufacturers outlet centers and provide opportunities to sell an assortment of in season  discontinued and excess merchandise at lower price points 
warehouse outlet stores 
freestanding warehouse outlet stores appeal to our most value conscious consumers and enable us to liquidate excess merchandise  discontinued lines and odd size inventory in a cost efficient manner 
financial overview our net sales for increased million  or percent  to million from million in  which marked a return to positive net sales growth following a decline in net sales for and of and  respectively 
our strong performance in was based on net sales increases from all of our business segments 
we have three reportable segments domestic wholesale sales  international wholesale sales  and retail sales  which includes domestic and international retail sales 
in addition  we report an all other segment  which includes our e commerce sales and other miscellaneous sales 
we evaluate segment performance based primarily on net sales and gross margins 
our domestic wholesale segment is our largest distribution channel comprising  and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international wholesale sales comprised   and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
retail sales comprised  and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which our domestic retail sales comprised   and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international retail sales did not comprise more than of our consolidated net sales in  or 
table of contents domestic wholesale unit sales volume decreased to million pairs in from million pairs in  and our average selling price per pair increased to in from in this increase in average selling price per pair and decrease in unit sales volume were due to the continued improvement and good response to our in season product in further  the increase in average selling price and reduction in unit volume in as compared to were attributable to three factors that affected our business and results of operations in the first factor was the build up of committed inventory which includes inventory on hand and in transit from the factory which is on our books and inventory in process at the factory which is not on our books from our third party manufacturers at december  the purpose of this increase in committed inventory was to take advantage of at once orders during the first half of  which did not materialize to the levels we had anticipated 
second  as a result of our at once orders not achieving the levels expected  we ended up with higher than anticipated inventory levels  which reached a high of million at june  as a result  we undertook an aggressive sales strategy to significantly reduce our inventory levels in an already difficult retail environment  one where consumers were seeking product markdowns at the retail level 
this sales strategy was initiated in both of our domestic and international wholesale distribution channels 
third  we saw a decrease in demand for some of our product lines that had traditionally made up a larger portion of our domestic wholesale sales 
we achieved diluted earnings per share of on net sales of million in our higher net sales and profitability for as compared to are primarily attributable to stronger than anticipated sales of in line product  less markdowns and returns  a strong at once holiday business  both international and retail sales being ahead of projections and a reduction of expenses 
we had working capital of million  an increase of million from working capital of million at december  we generated million in cash during bringing our cash balance to million compared to million at december  these positive results are being driven by focusing on our core strengths and initiatives which included new product design and delivery 
we continually update  modify and expand both our skechers brand and fashion brands based on current and expected fashion trends 
this includes the addition of new styles within existing product lines  such as our skechers work and skechers sport lines  and in some cases the addition of new product lines such as our fashion brands of motoring  marc ecko  ecko unltd  ecko red and our high end men s line mark nason 
the improvement in all of our business lines can be attributed to our product development process which allows for frequent product introductions as well as allows us to design products that anticipate and accommodate consumers ever evolving preferences 
this also included building our existing product lines with updates to proven sellers and creating new styles that we believe will be core to the line in the coming seasons 
building the skechers brand 
we continue to build a quality brand 
during  we rolled out our new marketing campaigns our we put the s in action worldwide campaign and our christina aguilera naughty and nice international campaign 
the naughty and nice campaign has been extended with respect to certain images through june and has also been expanded to include the domestic market 
we then took these advertisements to the places where customers shop  specifically ad placements in mall kiosks  and other places that they frequent daily such as bus benches and bus boards 
we believe that these campaigns are both an impactful and a cost effective medium to reach more consumers 
we believe these concentrated advertising efforts as well as the anticipated international acceptance of our new styles should generate additional demand for our products in careful management of expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented some initial cost reductions based on our anticipated sales levels and due to these initiatives we have seen reductions in our selling and general and administrative expenses on a percentage of net sales basis in during  we also focused on maximizing the profitability of our existing retail stores and international subsidiaries rather than expanding into new markets 
in  we expanded our international operations with the establishment of subsidiaries in canada  the benelux region and italy 
these subsidiaries support our direct selling efforts in those countries and are in addition to our subsidiaries established in the united kingdom  germany  france and spain 
because we believe that we have established our international direct selling presence in most major international retail markets  we did not form any additional international subsidiaries in and we do not anticipate expanding our international subsidiary business into new markets in instead  we will focus on i enhancing the efficiency of our international operations  ii increasing our customer base  iii increasing the product count within each customer and iv tailoring our product offerings currently available to our international customers to increase demand for our product 
strategic product licensing 
we believe that selective licensing of the skechers brand name to non footwear related manufacturers broadens and enhances the skechers image without requiring us to expend significant capital investments or incur significant incremental operating expenses 
we signed our first licensing deal in  and as of december   we had eight domestic and three international licensing agreements under the categories of apparel  accessories  loungewear and swimwear 
our 
table of contents most significant license to date is with kids headquarters for skechers kids apparel  which launched for back to school selling season in due to the successful launch of the children s apparel line  we have expanded the agreement to include infant and toddler apparel and boys and girls daywear and sleepwear 
we also make royalty payments for the use of other brands 
during  we began shipping product and making royalty payments for the use of rhino unltd 
and rhino red in our footwear lines 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for were million  an increase of million or over net sales of million in the increase in net sales was due to increased wholesale sales  retail sales and increased direct international sales in the united kingdom  germany  spain  benelux  italy and canada  offset by decreased sales in france 
our domestic wholesale segment increased or million to million compared to million in the increase in domestic wholesale segment net sales came on a unit sales volume decrease to million pairs from million pairs in our average selling price per pair increased to from in the increase in average selling price per pair and the decrease in unit sales volume were due to the reduced level of markdown and closeout merchandise in  when compared to  when we were focused on reducing our inventory levels as discussed above 
our retail segment sales increased million to million in  a increase over sales of million in the increase in retail sales was due to the increase in warehouse and factory outlet stores and positive comparable store sales 
since december   we have opened four new domestic stores and closed four other domestic stores 
these new stores contributed million in net sales during of our new store additions  three were outlet stores and one was a warehouse store  which tend to have higher average sales per store than our concept stores 
in addition  during  we realized positive comparable store sales increases in many of our domestic and international retail stores ranging from an increase of in our warehouse stores comparable sales to an increase of in our international store comparable sales 
our domestic retail sales increased due to positive comparable sales and having twenty three retail stores that were opened in being open the entire year in we currently have domestic retail stores  and we believe that we have a presence in most major markets 
as such  we believe we are able to curtail our retail expansion and therefore  we only currently plan to open between seven and ten domestic retail store stores in during we closed four retail stores as compared to closing two retail stores in we periodically review all of our stores for impairment 
further  we carefully review our under performing stores and may consider the non renewal of leases upon completion of the current term of the applicable lease 
our international retail sales increased in compared to  due to increased comparable sales  six stores opened in being open the entire year of  as well as favorable currency translation adjustments 
we currently do not anticipate opening any international retail stores in our international wholesale segment sales increased million to million in  a increase over sales of million in our international wholesale sales consist of direct sales those we make to department stores and specialty retailers and sales to our distributors who in turn sell to department stores and specialty retailers in various international regions where we do not sell direct 
the increase in international wholesale sales was due to increased distributor and direct subsidiary sales 
our distributor sales increased million to million in  a increase over sales of million in this was primarily due to increased sales into japan  panama  chile  the philippines and australia 
our international direct sales increased million to million in  a increase over sales of million in the increase in direct sales was primarily due to increased sales into the united kingdom  germany  canada  italy and spain  offset by decreased sales into france 
our e commerce sales increased million to million in  a increase over sales of million in our e commerce sales made up less than of our consolidated net sales in both fiscal and gross profit gross profit for increased million to million as compared to million in  which included an increase of million  or  to million in compared to million in for our domestic wholesale segment 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  increased to in from in this gross margin increase was the result of the increase in domestic wholesale margins  which increased to in from for  and as a result of retail sales becoming a larger portion of consolidated net sales  which achieve higher gross margins than our wholesale sales 
the domestic wholesale margin increase was primarily due to the significantly lower volume of markdown merchandise  lower sales 
table of contents allowances and a lower volume of close out product to discounters  all of which previously resulted from our significantly higher levels of inventory in in addition  we realized higher margins within our men s and women s sport lines and women s active lines in compared to gross profit for our retail segment increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in this increase in gross profit was due to stores that were opened in being open the entire year in and positive comparable store sales 
gross margins decreased to in as compared to in the decrease in margin was primarily due to a larger portion of our retail sales coming from our lower margin outlet and warehouse stores  despite both positive comparable store sales increases and new store openings in these formats 
in addition  we increased our promotional price activity within those store formats in when compared to which drove down our margins 
gross profit for our international wholesale segment increased million  or  to million for compared to million in gross margins were for compared to in international wholesale sales through our foreign subsidiaries achieve higher gross margins than our international wholesale sales through our foreign distributors 
gross margins for our international subsidiary sales increased to for compared to in the increase in gross margins for our international subsidiary sales was due to a broader acceptance of our new styles as well as a lower volume of close out product to discounters 
during the second half of  our third party manufacturers located in china notified us of electrical shortages which has caused them  in some cases  to shut down production at least one day a week 
for production orders that were outstanding with firm delivery dates and that did not ship in time to meet our delivery requirements  the manufacturer paid the costs to overnight product to our distribution centers 
these electrical shortages may extend the production time necessary to produce our orders  and there may be circumstances where we may have to incur premium freight charges to expedite product to our customers 
if we incur a significant amount of premium charges to airfreight product for our customers  our gross profit will be negatively affected if we are unable to collect those charges 
we are currently unable to determine the extent  if any  of any adverse margin impact we may realize as a result of air freighting product to customers 
premium freight charges incurred during were not significant 
our cost of sales includes the cost of footwear purchased from our manufacturers  duties  quota costs  inbound freight including ocean  air and freight from the dock to our distribution centers  brokers fees and storage costs 
because we include expenses related to our distribution network in general and administrative expenses while some of our competitors may include expenses of this type in cost of sales  our gross margins may not be comparable  and we may report higher gross margins than some of our competitors in part for this reason 
licensing net licensing royalties increased million  or  to million for compared to million in the increase in licensing royalties is primarily the result of an additional million in royalties associated with our licensing agreement for skechers kids apparel with kids headquarters  which launched during the back to school selling season in during  we entered into various domestic and international licensing agreements 
these new licensing arrangements have been in the development stage  and many of these licensed products became available at retail during the increase in licensing royalties was offset by increased royalty payments made by us of million associated with our licensing agreement for our rhino unltd 
and rhino red lines 
we expect our licensing revenue from kids headquarters to slightly increase in  however  this increase could be offset by increased royalty payments associated with our license agreement with rhino unltd 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased by million  or  to million for from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and in and  respectively 
selling expenses consist primarily of the following accounts sales representative sample costs  sales commissions  trade shows  advertising and promotional costs  which may include television and ad production costs  and expenses associated with marketing materials 
the decrease in selling expenses was primarily due to reduced media advertising expenses of million  offset by increased trade show and catalog expenses of million and increased sales commissions and sales representative samples of million 
media advertising decreased due to a reduction in international advertising and promotional costs of approximately million despite commencing a major international print campaign in featuring international pop star christina aguilera  a reduction in television advertising of million and reduced promotional spending of million 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following accounts salaries  wages and related taxes and various overhead costs associated with our corporate staff  domestic and international retail operations  non selling related costs of our international operations  costs associated with our domestic and european distribution centers  professional fees related to both legal and accounting  insurance  and depreciation and amortization  amongst other expenses 
our distribution network related costs are included in general and administrative expenses and are not allocated to segments 
the increase in expenses was primarily the result of increased revenues in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased salaries and wages and related payroll costs of million  increased warehouse and distribution costs of million  increased rent of million and increased bad debt expense of million  which were partially offset by lower professional fees of million and travel expenses of million 
in addition  expenses related to our distribution network  including the functions of purchasing  receiving  inspecting  allocating  warehousing and packaging our products totaled million and million for and  respectively 
impairment charges related to the write off of fixed assets at one of our domestic retail stores was million in as compared to million for the same period last year 
during  we modified our wholesale and retail expansion strategies 
we believe that we have established our presence in most major domestic and international retail markets 
as such  we believe that we are able to curtail our retail expansion  and therefore  we opened only four domestic and no international retail stores in while closing four other stores 
we currently plan to open between seven and ten stores in in addition  we currently believe that we have sufficiently developed our international direct selling efforts  therefore  we currently do not anticipate entering any new international markets in instead  we will focus on i enhancing the efficiency of our international operations  ii increasing our customer base  iii increasing the product count within each customer and iv tailoring our product offerings currently available to our international customers to increase demand for our product 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented some initial cost reductions based on our anticipated sales levels and have realized some benefits from these reductions 
we continue to review our cost structure to develop efficiencies within our operations  however  we believe that our current cost structure is consistent with our anticipated sales levels in interest expense net interest expense for decreased million to million for compared to net interest expense of million in interest expense is derived from our convertible notes  mortgages on our distribution center  our corporate office located in manhattan beach  california  our capital lease obligations and interest on amounts owed to our foreign manufacturers 
the reduction in interest expense is due to the amortized reduction of our long term debt and capital leases 
other income expense other expense  net increased million to million for  compared to million in year the increase in other expense was due the settlement of various lawsuits for million in income taxes the effective tax rate for was 
income tax expense for was million compared to million for the tax provision was computed using the effective tax rates applicable to each of our domestic and international taxable jurisdictions 
the rate is lower than the expected domestic rate of approximately  due to our non us subsidiary earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and our reinvestment of undistributed earnings from our non us subsidiaries  thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance to the united states internal revenue service 
as such  we did not provide for deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries

the reduction in capital expenditures in was primarily due to the decrease in the number of new store openings 
the reduction in capital expenditures is also reflective of our reduced international expansion activities 
we currently expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately to million  which includes the opening of seven to ten domestic retail stores  minor capital improvements at our distribution centers and investments in information technology

we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  available borrowings under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  proceeds from the issuance of the notes and our financing arrangements will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund our anticipated working capital and capital requirements through however  in connection with our current strategies  we will incur significant working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the levels at which we maintain inventory  the market acceptance of our footwear  the success of our international operations  the levels of promotion and advertising required to promote our footwear  the extent to which we invest in new product design and improvements to our existing product design and the number and timing of new store openings 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
failure to obtain such financing could delay or prevent our planned expansion  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible securities  dilution to our stockholders could occur

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates are affected by more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  promotional items  valuation allowances  inventory reserves  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  litigation reserves  valuations of deferred income taxes  cooperative arrangements and foreign currency translation 
revenue recognition 
we derive income from the sale of footwear and royalties earned from licensing the skechers brand 
the significant portion of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of footwear 
domestically  goods are shipped directly from our domestic distribution center in ontario  california  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center fob shipping point 
for our international wholesale accounts  product is shipped direct from our distribution center in liege  belgium  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center 
for our distributor sales  the goods are delivered directly from the independent factories to our distributors freight forwarders on a free named carrier fca basis  and revenue is recognized upon receipt of a freight cargo receipt 
in all of the above cases  each of the following has been met prior to revenue recognition title has passed  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalty income is earned from our licensing arrangements 
upon signing a new licensing agreement  we receive up front fees  which are generally characterized as prepaid royalties 
these fees are initially deferred and recognized as revenue as earned ie as licensed sales are reported to our company 
the first calculated royalty payment is based on actual sales of the licensed product 
typically  at each quarter end we receive correspondence from our licensees indicating what the actual sales for the period were 
this information is used to calculate and accrue the related royalties based on the terms of the agreement 
promotional items 
we typically provide for two types of promotional items  footwear and non footwear 
promotional items are accounted for as follows footwear 
footwear products that are sold at a reduced price to our customers either through our wholesale or retail distribution channels  are recorded in the net sales line item at the ultimate amount received billed at the time of revenue recognition 
footwear given away as part of a promotion ie seeding product to celebrities and editors  through promotions and events as well as charity related functions  etc 
is included in the line item costs of sales 
these amounts are immaterial in relation to our total cost of sales line items 
sales samples that are used by our sales personnel and distributors are charged to the line item selling expense  at cost 
the footwear that is given away is generally not given to any existing wholesale or retail customers 
non footwear 
non footwear promotional items  such as concert promotions and give aways at these events ie key chains  t shirts  etc  are charged to advertising and promotions expense  which are included in the line item selling expense 
such items are generally considered brand promotion 
allowance for bad debts  returns and customer chargebacks 
allowance for bad debts we insure selected customer account balances both greater than  and accepted by the insurance company 
if insured customers do not pay  we are fully insured for non payment that resulted from credit problems 
we also provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account  
table of contents and it is adjusted accordingly 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions in the customers country or industry  historical losses and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
reserve for chargebacks  returns and allowances we reserve for potential disputed amounts or chargebacks with our customers 
our chargeback reserve is based on a collectibility percentage based on factors such as historical trend  current economic conditions  and nature of the chargeback receivables 
we also reserve for potential sales returns and other allowances based on historical trends 
the likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment 
reserves are fully provided for all probable losses of this nature 
for receivables that are not specifically identified as high risk  we provide a reserve based upon a percent of sales for the last two months 
this percentage is based on our historical loss rate 
a change in this rate would not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
gross trade accounts receivable balance was million and the allowance for bad debts  returns and customer chargebacks was million at december  inventory reserves 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow moving inventory 
our review is based on inventory on hand  prior sales and our expected net realizable value 
our analysis includes a review of inventory quantities on hand at period end in relation to year to date sales and projections for sales in the near future 
the net realizable value  or market value  is determined based on our estimate of sales prices of such inventory through off price or discount store channels 
a write down of inventory is considered permanent and creates a new cost basis for those units 
the likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent primarily on our expectation of future consumer demand for our product 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer demand for our product or of the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory valuation changes  either favorably or unfavorably  compared to the requirement determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
at december   our gross inventory value was million and our inventory reserve was million 
valuation of long lived assets 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the impairment of long lived assets that require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income  any loss of legal ownership or title to the asset s  any significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
in addition  we prepare a summary of store contribution from our domestic retail stores to assess potential impairment of the fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
stores with negative contribution opened in excess of twenty four months are then reviewed in detail to determine if impairment exists 
at december  we recorded an impairment charge for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures at one of our retail stores totaling million 
litigation reserves 
estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would depend on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on a large portion of the remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as such  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result 
table of contents from unfavorable outcomes in litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of our deferred tax assets depends on future taxable income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies amongst the various domestic and international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we evaluate our projections of taxable income to determine the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
cooperative arrangements 
we do not have a formal cooperative advertising program and any activity is usually small 
any payments made or credits provided to our resellers are either charged against net sales  if the criteria of emerging issues task force issue no 
has not been met  or charged to the line item caption selling expense when the applicable criteria has been met 
amounts that are charged as an expense in the line item caption selling expense are typically supported by an invoice or other supporting documentation from our customers that provide verifiable support of their expenditures  which may include third party invoices for advertising related costs  ie photo and catalog costs 
foreign currency translation 
our international operations generally use their respective local currencies as their functional currency 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation sfas  revenues and expenses from our international subsidiaries are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect for the period in which such revenues and expenses occur 
international subsidiaries that use their local currency as their functional currency translate their assets and liabilities using current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gains and losses for such subsidiaries are included within accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
one international subsidiary has a functional currency of the us dollar 
resulting remeasurement gains and losses from this subsidiary are included in the determination of net earnings 
a substantial portion of our intercompany loans are considered long term investments and are included as a component of translation adjustment in other comprehensive income 
inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on our sales or profitability 
however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of inflation on future operating results 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our sales or profitability 
while we have been able to offset our foreign product cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make such increases or changes in the future 
exchange rates we receive us dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our royalty income 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future 
during and  exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our inventory costs 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
future accounting changes on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

table of contents statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt statement using the modified prospective method 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note m to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements but we do not expect it to have a material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we do not hold any derivative securities that require fair value presentation per fasb statement no 
market risk is the potential loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have and will have an impact on our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations 
at december   no amounts were outstanding that were subject to changes in interest rates  however  the interest rate charged on our line of credit facility is based on the prime rate of interest  and changes in the prime rate of interest will have an effect on the interest charged on outstanding balances 
no amounts are currently outstanding 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our non us dollar functional currency foreign subsidiary s revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates may affect the value of our inventory commitments 
also  inventory purchases of our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which could have the effect of increasing the cost of goods sold in the future 
we manage these risks by primarily denominating these purchases and commitments in us dollars 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risks
