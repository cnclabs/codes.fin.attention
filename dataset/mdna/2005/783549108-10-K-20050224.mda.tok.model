item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item of this report on form k 
overview our business is divided into three business segments our fleet management solutions fms business segment provides leasing  commercial rental and programmed maintenance of commercial trucks  tractors and trailers to customers  principally in the us  canada and the us  our supply chain solutions scs business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions throughout north america and in latin america  europe and asia  and our dedicated contract carriage dcc business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in north america 
we operate in extremely competitive markets 
our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality  price  technology and service offerings 
as an alternative to using our services  customers may also choose to provide these services for themselves  or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors 
our customer base includes governments and enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive  electronics  high tech  telecommunications  manufacturing  aerospace  consumer goods  paper and paper products  office equipment  food and beverage  and general retail industries 
over the past several years we have made significant transformations in our business  addressing many of the fundamental business processes throughout the organization 
from to  we reduced our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet in order to deliver long term results to our shareholders and also to make ryder more competitive in the marketplace 
in  we continued this transformation by demonstrating earnings leverage through profitable growth 
during  we were successful in growing revenue in our transaction businesses and through strategic acquisitions in our fms business 
as discussed in more detail throughout our md a  during net earnings increased to million compared with million in after tax earnings in benefited from gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of million and net income tax benefits of million associated with developments in various tax matters 
excluding these items  the earnings improvement was driven by the positive impact of fms acquisitions  improved fms commercial rental performance  higher gains on fms used vehicle sales  lower pension costs  and reductions in operating expenses stemming from cost management and process improvement actions 
total revenue increased to billion compared with due to the growth in fms 
during  fms revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from better pricing and increased activity 
revenue comparisons for were also favorably impacted by increased fms fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices  and foreign currency exchange rate changes related to our international operations 
we continued to target strategic opportunities in fms 
in march  ryder completed the acquisition of ruan leasing company for million 
this acquisition enabled us to leverage our existing infrastructure within fms and drive profitable growth 
we also completed two acquisitions related to fms at the end of capital expenditures increased to billion compared with million in the increase in capital expenditures was due primarily to increased activity in our full service lease business for both new and replacement vehicles 
our debt to equity ratio declined to from in total obligations to equity ratio declined to from in the decline in our leverage ratios was driven by our reduced 
table of contents funding needs as a result of improved operating performance and higher proceeds from sales of property and revenue earning equipment 
the irs proposed adjustments related to our to tax period which were resolved in february see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
items affecting comparability between periods fms acquisitions on march   we completed an asset purchase agreement with ruan leasing company ruan under which we acquired ruan s fleet of approximately  vehicles  of its service locations and more than customers 
ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately  vehicles 
effective december   we also acquired substantially all the assets of general car and truck leasing system general  a major privately held commercial truck leasing  maintenance and rental company  including general s fleet of approximately  vehicles  of its service locations and more than customers 
the combined networks operate under ryder s name and allow us to leverage our existing us infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the midwest  southeast  mid atlantic and southwest 
the results of these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated results of ryder since the dates of acquisitions 
accounting changes as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies consolidation of variable interest entities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  effective july   ryder consolidated three variable interest entities vies in connection with the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised by fin r issued december 
the consolidated vies were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements 
in connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement  we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligated ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities  if any are realized 
therefore  fin required that these entities be consolidated 
the consolidation of the vies did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings  however  reported depreciation expense  equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the vies 
in addition  both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased in and due to the add back of depreciation expense on the vies revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on vies debt

net earnings in benefited from after tax gains on the sale of our headquarters complex of million  or per diluted common share  and a net income tax benefit of million  or per diluted common share  associated with developments in various tax matters 
excluding these items  the earnings improvement in was driven by the positive impact of fms acquisitions  increased fms rental pricing and utilization  higher gains on fms used vehicle sales  lower pension costs  and reductions in operating expenses stemming from cost management and process improvement actions 
the earnings growth rate in exceeded the related earnings per share growth rate because the average number of shares outstanding increased over prior year reflecting the impact of stock issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased to million in compared with the increase in earnings was due to reductions in operating expenses stemming from cost management and process improving actions  improved scs operating performance  better fms rental pricing  and the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations 
these earnings increases were partially offset by an increase in annual pension expense that principally impacted our fms business segment  which employs the majority of the employees that participate in our

years ended december in thousands revenue fleet management solutions supply chain solutions dedicated contract carriage eliminations total total revenue increased to billion in compared with during  fms revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet  better pricing and increased activity 
fms acquisitions contributed approximately million for the year ended december  revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased fms fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices  and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations 
our businesses realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of higher fuel services revenue as these generally reflect costs that are passed through to our customers 
total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of due to the strengthening of the british pound and the canadian dollar 
these increases were partially offset by reduced fms full service lease revenue on our us base business excluding acquisitions and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our scs and dcc business segments 
total revenue increased to billion in compared with comparisons were impacted by increased fms fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices 
during  fms was negatively impacted by continued softness in the us economy resulting in reduced full service lease and programmed maintenance demand  as well as the impact of some ancillary business not renewed 
these decreases were partially offset by improved commercial rental revenue due to higher pricing 
scs revenue decreased in compared with as a result of volume reductions combined with the non renewal of certain customer contracts 
revenue comparisons were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and expanded business in canada  latin america and asia 
total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of due to the strengthening of the british pound and the canadian dollar offset partially by the weakness of certain latin american currencies 
years ended december in thousands operating expense percentage of revenue operating expense increased to billion in compared with the increase was principally a result of increases in fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices in operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet and added operating costs attributed to the fms acquisitions 
operating expense increased to billion in compared with the increase was principally a result of increases in fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices in operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs as a result of an older fleet  offset by a reduction in overhead spending from ongoing cost management actions 

table of contents years ended december in thousands salaries and employee related costs percentage of revenue salaries and employee related costs decreased to billion in compared with the decrease was primarily a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our scs and dcc business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts  offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation 
average headcount decreased in compared with the number of employees at december  decreased to approximately  compared with  at december  pension expense decreased million in to million compared with and principally impacted fms 
the decrease in pension expense is primarily attributable to the us pension plan and reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease to approximately million in our pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans 
see critical accounting estimates for further discussion on pension accounting estimates 
the anticipated decrease in pension expense would primarily impact our fms business segment 
salaries and employee related costs decreased to billion in compared with the decrease was a result of headcount reductions  which offset higher pension expense 
average headcount decreased in compared with reflecting the non renewal of certain customer contracts  the impact of cost management actions and reduced volumes across all business segments 
years ended december in thousands freight under management expense percentage of revenue freight under management fum expense represents subcontracted freight costs on logistics contracts for which ryder purchases transportation 
fum expense increased to million in compared with during  fum expense in our scs business segment increased due to the impact of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs 
the volume declines experienced in our scs business during were principally attributed to non transportation based activities 
fum expense was flat in compared with as the net volume declines experienced in our scs business during was principally attributed to non transportation management activity 
years ended december in thousands depreciation expense gains on vehicle sales  net equipment rental depreciation expense relates primarily to fms revenue earning equipment 
depreciation expense increased to million in compared with the growth in depreciation expense during reflected the consolidation of vies effective july  approximately million  the impact of vehicles added as part of the recent fms acquisitions  the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units 
see discussion on fms in operating results by business segment for further detail on vehicle counts 
depreciation expense increased to million in compared with although the overall fleet size owned and leased declined during  depreciation expense grew because of an increase in the average number of owned compared with leased revenue earning equipment units as a result of the 
table of contents consolidation of vies effective july  approximately million  the conversion of leased units to owned status on lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units 
gains on vehicle sales  net increased to million in compared with and to million in compared with the increases in gains on vehicle sales were due to increases in the number of fms unit sales of owned vehicles and improvements in the average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods 
we periodically review and adjust residual values  reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values 
see critical accounting estimates for further discussion on depreciation and residual value guarantees 
while we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate  there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur  resulting in losses on disposal 
equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in fms 
equipment rental costs decreased to million in compared with the significant decrease in was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles compared with owned resulting from the consolidation of vies effective july  approximately million  the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring lease units with owned units 
equipment rental costs decreased to million in compared with the decrease was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles compared with owned resulting from the consolidation of vies effective july  approximately million  term extensions and an overall decline in fleet size  which principally impacted equipment under lease 
years ended december in thousands interest expense percentage of revenue interest expense increased to million in compared with the increase in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels  including debt of consolidated vies

interest expense increased to million in compared with the increase in interest expense reflects the impact of interest expense of approximately million on debt of vies consolidated effective july   partially offset by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions  which principally benefited fms 
years ended december in thousands miscellaneous income  net miscellaneous income  net decreased to million in compared with miscellaneous income  net decreased because of the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain vies 
prior to the consolidation of vies effective july   miscellaneous income  net included fee income related to administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions 
as a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts  we no longer recognize service fee income 
miscellaneous income  net increased to million in compared with during  miscellaneous income  net was favorably impacted from a million gain on sale of a facility in our european fms operations  better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans and lower losses on the sale of trade receivables related to the decreased use 
table of contents of our revolving receivables financing program 
these positive factors were partially offset by the elimination of servicing fee income related to the vehicle lease trusts 
years ended december in thousands restructuring and other recoveries charges  net restructuring and other recoveries charges  net in relate primarily to million in gains from properties sold in connection with the relocation of our headquarters complex

in accordance with the terms of the services agreement  ryder notified the information technology services provider of its intent to terminate certain services and recorded charges totaling million for contract termination million and transition costs incurred since termination million 
by december   all transition activities were completed and we expect future cost reductions associated with the termination of these services to benefit our results starting in restructuring and other recoveries charges  net were million in during  ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately positions as a result of on going cost management and process improvement actions in ryder s fms and scs business segments and central support services css 
the charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling million

css represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments  including sales and marketing  human resources  finance  corporate services  shared management information systems  customer solutions  health and safety  legal and communications 
the objective of the nbt measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and  ultimately  to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of css costs 
in  we changed our methodology of allocating sales support costs between fms and dcc segments and allocating insurance related costs between fms  scs and dcc segments 
accordingly  and segment nbt measures have been adjusted to provide the retroactive effect of these changes 
certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in css 
included within the unallocated overhead remaining within css are the costs for investor relations  corporate communications  public affairs and certain executive compensation 
see note  segment reporting  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of how the remainder of css costs is allocated to the business segments 
our fms segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel  maintenance and other ancillary services to our scs and dcc segments

nye units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet 
preparations include activities such as adding lift gates  paint  decals  cargo area and refrigeration equipment 
nle units represent vehicles held for sale  as well as vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous days 
these vehicles may be temporarily out of service  being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment 
the number of nye units increased during the year consistent with the anticipated higher level of new vehicles coming into the fleet for replacement lease equipment and new lease sales 
we would expect this number to grow in as the volume of lease activity increases 
in  the number of other nle units declined as a result of improved rental utilization

additionally  investing activities reflect payments made in connection with fms acquisitions 
we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity 
we refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities excluding changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold and investing activities as free cash flow 
although free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance 
we believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations 
our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited

capital expenditures increased in compared with due primarily to increased activity in our full service lease business for both new and replacement vehicles 
capital expenditures increased in compared with due to higher levels of vehicle replacements  primarily for the commercial rental fleet 
vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low in and as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers  redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet 
as a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales activity  total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately billion in  including vehicle replacements of approximately billion and spending for anticipated incremental growth of approximately million

no acquisitions were completed in we will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in fms  scs and dcc in financing and other funding transactions we utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines 
the variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt  asset backed securities  bank term loans  leasing arrangements  bank credit facilities and commercial paper 

table of contents the following table shows the movements in our debt balance years ended december in thousands debt balance at january cash related changes in debt net change in commercial paper borrowings proceeds from issuance of medium term notes proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments retirement of medium term notes other debt repaid  including capital lease obligations non cash changes in debt fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging addition of capital lease obligations addition of variable interest entity debt changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items total changes in debt debt balance at december our funding philosophy generally attempts to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets 
we utilize both fixed and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of variable rate debt 
the variable rate portion of our total obligations including notional value of swap agreements was at december   compared with at december  ryder s leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows december  to december  to equity equity dollars in thousands on balance sheet debt pv of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for equipment total obligations present value does not reflect payments ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates 
debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity 
total obligations to equity represents debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles  discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception  all divided by total equity 
although total obligations is a non gaap financial measure  we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess ryder s overall leverage position 
the decrease in total obligations to equity ratio in was driven by our reduced funding needs as a result of improved operating performance and higher proceeds from sales of property and revenue earning equipment 
leverage ratios in were also impacted by the net increase in shareholders equity of million resulting primarily from earnings net of common stock repurchases 
we anticipate these ratios will increase in as a result of the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher income tax payments 
our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short and long term debt ratings 
these ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk 
table of contents associated with particular ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable 
lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets 
a downgrade of ryder s debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper 
as a result  we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below 
our debt ratings at december  were as follows short term long term outlook moody s investors service p baa stable june standard poor s ratings services a bbb positive july fitch ratings f bbb positive january during may  ryder refinanced its million credit facility with a new five year million global revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders 
the credit facility is used to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper 
the credit facility can also be used to issue up to million in letters of credit there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at december  
foreign borrowings of million were outstanding under the facility at december  at ryder s option  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor  prime  federal funds or local equivalent rates 
the credit facility s current annual facility fee is basis points  which applies to the total facility of million  and is based on ryder s current credit ratings 
the credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to ryder s business operations  however  the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties  events of default  cross default provisions  and certain affirmative and negative covenants 
in order to maintain availability of funding  ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth  as defined in the agreement  of less than or equal to 
the ratio at december  was 
during  ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to issue up to million of available securities 
proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for capital expenditures  debt refinancing and general corporate purposes 
at december  ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities in millions global revolving credit facility shelf registration statement as of february   the amount available under the global revolving credit facility decreased to million  primarily as a result of the payment made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the to period 
see note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we believe such facilities  along with other funding sources  will be sufficient to fund operations in off balance sheet arrangements we periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations  to diversify our funding among different classes of investors eg  regional banks  pension plans and insurance companies and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments 
these sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be vies 
in general  these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet  as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt 
accordingly  sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense 
during  we completed two sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be vies 
proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions totaled million 
these leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles 
table of contents residual value guarantees that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term 
we did not enter into any sale leaseback or vehicle securitization transactions during the years ended december  and see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ryder participated in an agreement to sell with limited recourse trade receivables on a revolving and uncommitted basis 
this agreement expired in december under the program  ryder sold receivables from time to time in order to fund operations  particularly when the cost of such sales was cost effective compared with other means of funding  notably  commercial paper 
losses on receivable sales and related costs associated with this program were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were included in miscellaneous income  net 
contractual obligations and commitments as part of our ongoing operations  we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements  lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations 
the following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at december  thereafter total in thousands debt capital lease obligations total debt interest on debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations self insurance obligations other long term liabilities  total total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year and bears interest principally at fixed rates 
interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at december  amounts are based on existing debt obligations and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations 
represents future lease payments associated with vehicles  equipment and properties under operating leases 
amounts are based upon the assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements 
no effect has been given to renewals  cancellations  contingent rentals or future rate changes 
the majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the most significant items included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services and vehicles 
purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued expenses 
represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams 
the most significant items included were derivative contracts  deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations 
the amounts exclude our minimum funding requirements as set forth by erisa and international regulatory bodies  which are million in our minimum funding requirements after are dependent on several factors 
however  we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next years is approximately million for the us plan assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged 
we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit opeb plans 
these plans are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see further discussion in note  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents guarantees in the ordinary course of business  ryder provides certain guarantees or indemnifications to third parties as part of certain lease  financing and sales agreements 
certain guarantees and indemnifications  whereby ryder may be contingently required to make a payment to a third party  are required to be disclosed even if the likelihood of payment is considered remote 
at december   our maximum exposure under these guarantees was million of which million was recognized as a liability 
see note  guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
pension information at december   we have an accumulated net pension equity charge of million after tax in connection with the accrual of an additional minimum pension liability  up slightly as compared with million after tax at december  as discount rates and updates to our mortality estimates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year 
total asset returns for our us qualified pension plan our primary plan were in the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates 
while we are not legally required to make a contribution to fund our us pension plan until september  we review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans 
during  total pension contributions  including our international plans  were approximately million 
after considering the contributions  the projected present value of estimated contributions for our us plan that would be required over the next years totals approximately million pre tax 
changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during could materially change  positively or negatively  the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in and beyond 
share repurchases and cash dividends in  our board of directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate  in part  the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
under the program  shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since january   up to million 
during the second quarter of  we completed the share repurchase program 
in  we purchased and retired approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
in  we purchased and retired  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
in july  our board of directors authorized a new two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
under this program  shares of common stock are purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees since may   which totaled approximately million shares at december  the program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than million shares of ryder common stock 
at december   we repurchased and retired approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under rule b of the securities exchange act of as part of the repurchase program 
cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were million in  million in and million in in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend reflects a increase from the quarterly cash dividend ryder has paid since market risk in the normal course of business  ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices 
we manage these exposures in several ways  including  in certain circumstances  the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent 
we do not 
table of contents enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio 
from time to time  we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets 
see note  financial instruments and risk management  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at december  at december   we had billion of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of and a fair value of billion  including the effects of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
at december   we had billion of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of and a fair value of billion  including the effects of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
we estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt  including the effects of interest rate swaps  which effectively changed million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of to libor based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
at december   the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled million 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt  including the effects of interest rate swaps  which effectively changed million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of to libor based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at december  totaled million 
a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings by approximately million 
exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies 
we also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
we generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries 
at december  and  we had a million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of million and million  respectively 
at december   we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of million 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations 
exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices 
at december   we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages 
we are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased 
increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers 
table of contents and have only a minor effect on profitability 
we believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact ryder s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental matters the operations of ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products  primarily diesel fuel  regulated under environmental protection laws 
these laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination 
capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately million in  million in and million in we incurred environmental expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses  such as licensing  testing and waste disposal fees 
based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations  environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from levels in the near term 
the ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors  primarily the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
based upon information presently available  we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters  although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year  will not have a material adverse effect on ryder s financial condition or liquidity 
see note  environmental matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely  can result in a material impact on ryder s financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods 
we periodically review the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with ryder s audit committee 
the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical 
depreciation and residual value guarantees we periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our fms business segment as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies revenue earning equipment  operating property and equipment and depreciation  and summary of significant accounting policies residual value guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reductions in residual values ie  the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment 
we review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment 
reviews are performed based on vehicle class  generally subcategories of trucks  tractors and trailers by weight and usage 
we consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles  expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles eg  rental fleet  and scs and dcc applications 
as a result  future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors 
based 
table of contents on the mix of revenue earning equipment at december   a decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in by approximately million 
ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements 
certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment 
results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease 
the amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease 
at december   total liabilities for residual value guarantees of million were included in accrued expenses for those payable in less than one year and in other non current liabilities 
while we believe that the amounts are adequate  changes to management s estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles  the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process 
based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at december   a decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in by approximately million 
pension plans we apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis 
each december  we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions  if warranted 
in determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost  we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate  expected long term rate of return  expected increase in compensation levels  retirement rate and mortality 
discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our december annual measurement date 
for  in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan  we used models that match projected benefits payments of our primary us plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds 
this method resulted in a discount rate about higher than our prior year method 
long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns 
investment management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience  while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality 
accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in note  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have an unrecognized loss of million at the end of compared with a loss of million at the end of the increase in the net actuarial loss in results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and updates to our mortality estimates  offset in part by assets earning a rate of return above the assumed rates and the amortization of the opening balance 
a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss will be amortized into earnings in the effect on years beyond will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans 
disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the net pension expense is presented in note  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a sensitivity analysis of projected net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan  the us pension plan  is presented below 
impact on net assumed rate change pension expense discount rate million expected long term rate of return on assets million rate of increase in compensation levels million 
table of contents self insurance accruals we use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims  claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments 
on an annual basis  third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness 
our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services  unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process 
while we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur 
based on self insurance accruals at december   a adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in by approximately million 
goodwill impairment we assess goodwill for impairment  as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary 
to determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist  we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance 
our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model 
estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist 
these assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance  economic conditions and actions we expect to take 
in addition to these factors  our scs reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions  customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur  resulting in a goodwill impairment loss 
in late  a key customer contract of our scs uk reporting unit was not renewed which caused us to assess whether this event resulted in an impairment indicator 
in light of the profitability of the customer account relative to the entire reporting unit  we did not consider it more likely than not that this event would result in a reduction of our scs uk reporting unit fair value below its carrying amount 
since that time  we have performed our annual impairment test for the scs uk reporting unit resulting in no goodwill impairment 
there can be no assurance that a deterioration in the economic conditions  customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance of our scs uk reporting unit or any other reporting unit will not result in a goodwill impairment loss 
at december   goodwill totaled million  of which million related to our scs uk reporting unit 
income taxes ryder s overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return  and some are timing differences  such as depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements 
we record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized 
at december  and  the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the scs business segment was million and million  respectively 
in determining the required level of valuation allowance  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is based on management s expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods 
our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain  and 
table of contents unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates 
should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made 
we are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the us and around the world 
tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to challenges from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due 
these challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions  or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings  we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits 
such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit 
actual results could vary materially from these estimates 
in  the irs began auditing our federal income tax returns for the to tax period 
since november  the irs proposed adjustments that challenged certain of our tax positions taken in the years under audit and proposed penalties for the underpayment of tax 
in february  we resolved all issues with the irs related to the to tax period  including interest and proposed penalties 
in connection with the resolution of this audit  on february   we paid million after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards  including interest through the date of payment 
the payment was funded through the issuance of commercial paper 
the amount we paid is consistent with our accrual as of december   and is included in accrued expenses 
in  the irs began auditing our federal income tax returns for and we believe that ryder has not entered into any other transactions since that raise the same type of issues identified by the irs in its most recent audit 
non gaap financial measures this annual report on form k includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be presented in the financial statements 
certain of this information is considered non gaap financial measures as defined by sec rules 
specifically  we refer to fms dry revenue  fms nbt as a of dry revenue  scs operating revenue  scs nbt as a of operating revenue  dcc operating revenue  dcc nbt as a of operating revenue  total obligations and total obligations to equity 
as required by sec rules  we provide a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non gaap financial measure provides useful information to investors 
non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap
