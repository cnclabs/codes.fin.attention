other services 
our canrig drilling technologies subsidiary manufactures top drives  which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs 
our top drives are marketed throughout the world 
during the last three years  approximately of our top drive sales were made to other nabors companies 
we also rent top drives and provide top drive installation  repair and maintenance services to our customers 
our epoch well services subsidiary offers rig instrumentation equipment  including sensors  proprietary rigwatch tm software and computerized equipment that monitors the real time performance of a rig 
in addition  epoch specializes in daily reporting software for drilling operations  making this data available through the internet via mywells 
com 
epoch also provides mudlogging services 
our ryan energy technologies subsidiary manufactures and sells directional drilling and rig instrumentation and data collection services to oil and gas exploration and service companies 
nabors has a interest in peak oilfield services company  a general partnership with a subsidiary of cook inlet region  inc  a leading alaskan native corporation 
peak oilfield services provides heavy equipment to move drilling rigs  water  other fluids and construction materials  primarily on alaska s north slope and in the cook inlet region 
the partnership also provides construction and maintenance for ice roads  pads  facilities  equipment  drill sites and pipelines 
our peak usa subsidiary provides hauling and maintenance services for customers in the us lower we time charter a fleet of offshore support vessels  including one crew boat  which operate in the gulf of mexico  trinidad and the middle east and provide marine transportation of drilling materials  supplies and crews for offshore rig operations and support for other offshore facilities 
the supply vessels are used as freight carrying vessels for bringing drill pipe  tubing  casing  drilling mud and other equipment to drilling rigs and production platforms 
our employees 
as of december   nabors employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately  were employed by unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe our relationship with our employees generally is good 
on october   the national labor relations board nlrb confirmed the selection of a collective bargaining representative at our alaska drilling subsidiary 
the unit covers most non supervisory drilling and related field personnel working on or about our rigs within the state of alaska 
negotiations with the union commenced during  an agreement was reached with representatives of the union in december  was submitted to the union membership for ratification  and was rejected by the membership in the first quarter we anticipate that the continuation of a collective bargaining unit at our alaska drilling subsidiary will not have any material adverse impact on the operations of that entity or nabors as a whole 
during the first quarter the nlrb commenced a suit asserting that our subsidiary committed an unfair labor practice in failing to adequately bargain with the collective bargaining representative in connection with a change in nabors medical insurance program 
the administrative law judge who heard the case ruled in nabors favor and the matter was appealed to an appeals panel of the nlrb  which affirmed the judge s ruling 
the matter was not further appealed and is now concluded 
on february   the alaska state district council of laborers filed a charge with the nlrb alleging that our subsidiary committed an unfair labor practice by threatening certain employees for the purpose of inducing them to alter a pro active safety report 
that charge since has been withdrawn 
on january   the alaska state district council of laborers filed a charge with the nlrb alleging that our subsidiary committed an unfair labor practice by denying an employee representation during an interview in connection with an investigation into allegations made by the employee of certain misconduct by others 
nabors denies the allegations  believes that it has meritorious defenses and further believes that the outcome of the dispute will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain rig employees in argentina and australia are represented by collective bargaining units 
seasonality 
our canadian and alaskan drilling and workover operations are subject to seasonal variations as a result of weather conditions and generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second calendar quarter of each year 
seasonality does not have a material impact on the remaining portions of our business 
our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in our canadian and alaskan operations 
research and development 
research and development does not constitute a material part of our overall business 
however  technology is of growing importance to our business and management expects to maintain its competitive position technologically with the internal development of technology or through strategic acquisitions 
industry competitive conditions 
to a large degree  nabors businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities by our customers and could also affect materially our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see risk factors fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and nabors revenues  cash flows and profitability 
our industry remains competitive 
the number of rigs continues to exceed demand in many of our markets  resulting in strong price competition 
many rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity  which may result in an oversupply of rigs in such areas 
many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis  which further increases competition based on price 
the land drilling  workover and well servicing market is generally more competitive than the offshore market due to the larger number of rigs and market participants 
in all of our geographic market areas  we believe price and availability and condition of equipment are the most significant factors in determining which drilling contractor is awarded a job 
other factors include the availability of trained personnel possessing the required specialized skills  the overall quality of service and safety record  and domestically  the ability to offer ancillary services 
in international markets  experience in operating in certain environments and customer alliances also have been factors in the selection of nabors 
certain competitors are present in more than one of nabors operating regions  although no one competitor operates in all of these areas 
in the us lower states  there are several hundred competitors with smaller national  regional or local rig operations 
in domestic land workover and well servicing  we compete with key energy services  inc and with numerous other competitors having smaller regional or local rig operations 
in canada and offshore  nabors competes with many firms of varying size  several of which have more significant operations in those areas than nabors 
internationally  nabors competes directly with various contractors at each location where it operates 
nabors believes that the market for land drilling  workover and well servicing contracts will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future 
our other operating segments represent a relatively smaller part of our business  and we have numerous competitors in each area 
our canrig subsidiary is one of the six major manufacturers of top drives 
its largest competitors are varco  tesco and national oilwell 
epoch s largest competitor in the manufacture of rig instrumentation systems is varco s totco subsidiary 
mudlogging services are provided by a number of entities that serve the oil and gas industry on a regional basis 
epoch competes for mudlogging customers with sperry sun and baker hughes in the gulf coast region  california and alaska 
in the us lower states  there are hundreds of rig transportation companies  and there are at least three or four that compete with peak usa in each of its operating regions 
in alaska  peak oilfield services principally competes with alaska petroleum contractors for road  pad and pipeline maintenance  and is one of many drill site and road construction companies  the largest of which is veco corporation 
our business strategy 
since  with the installation of our current management team  nabors has adhered to a consistent strategy aimed at positioning our company to grow and prosper in good times and to mitigate adverse effects during periods of poor market conditions 
we have continued to strive to attain a financial posture that would allow us to capitalize on market weakness by adding to our business base  thereby enhancing our upside potential at reasonable costs 
the principal elements of our strategy have been to maintain flexibility to respond to changing conditions 
maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
build cost effectively a base of premium assets 
build and maintain low operating costs through economies of scale 
develop and maintain long term  mutually attractive relationships with key customers and vendors 
build a diverse business in long term  sustainable and worthwhile geographic markets 
recognize and seize opportunities as they arise 
continually improve safety  quality and efficiency 
implement leading edge technology where cost effective to do so 
our business strategy is designed to allow us to grow and remain profitable in any market environment 
the major developments in our business in the past year illustrate our implementation of this strategy and its continuing success 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating nabors 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues  cash flows and profitability our operations are materially dependent upon the level of activity in oil and gas exploration and production 
both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices affect the level of such activity 
oil and gas prices and  therefore  the level of drilling  exploration and production activity can be volatile 
worldwide military  political and economic events  including initiatives by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  may affect both the demand for  and the supply of  oil and gas 
weather conditions  governmental regulation both in the united states and elsewhere  levels of consumer demand  the availability of pipeline capacity  and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and gas 
we believe that any prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would depress the level of exploration and production activity 
this would likely result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and profitability 
lower oil and gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate  renegotiate or fail to honor our drilling contracts  affect the fair market value of our rig fleet which in turn could trigger a write down for accounting purposes  affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel  and affect our ability to obtain access to capital to finance and grow our business 
there can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and gas and oilfield services industries 
we operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity  which may adversely affect our results of operations the oilfield services industry in which we operate is very competitive 
contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis  and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
many drilling  workover and well servicing rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and provided market conditions warrant  which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area 
in many markets in which we operate  the number of rigs available for use exceeds the demand for rigs  resulting in price competition 
most drilling and workover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids  which also results in price competition 
the land drilling market generally is more competitive than the offshore drilling market because there are larger numbers of rigs and competitors 
the nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that  if not insured or indemnified against  could adversely affect our results of operations our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling  workover and well servicing industries  including blowouts  cratering  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
our offshore operations are also subject to the hazards of marine operations including capsizing  grounding  collision  damage from heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks of war  civil disturbances or other political events 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
the occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against  or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations  could result in substantial losses 
in addition  there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of these risks  or  even if available  that it will be adequate or that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future  so as to make such insurance prohibitive 
it is likely that we will face continued upward pressure in our upcoming insurance renewals  our premiums and deductibles will be higher  and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
we expect that we may choose to increase the levels of deductibles and thus assume a greater degree of risk from time to time in order to minimize the effect of insurance premium increases 
the profitability of our international operations could be adversely affected by war  civil disturbance or political or economic turmoil we derive a significant portion of our business from international markets  including major operations in canada  the middle east  the far east and south and central america 
these operations are subject to various risks  including the risk of war  civil disturbances and governmental activities that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
in certain countries  our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls 
in the international markets in which we operate  we are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country  the imposition  application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain 
changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations the drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws  rules and regulations 
our cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial 
for example  federal law imposes a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills 
as an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and transportation equipment  we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law 
in addition  our well servicing  workover and production services operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials  some of which are classified as hazardous substances 
our operations and facilities are subject to numerous state and federal environmental laws  rules and regulations  including  without limitation  laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances  oilfield waste and other waste materials  the use of underground storage tanks and the use of underground injection wells 
we generally require customers to contractually assume responsibility for compliance with environmental regulations 
however  we are not always successful in allocating to customers all of these risks nor is there any assurance that the customer will be financially able to bear those risks assumed 
we employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use outside experts to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts 
liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
laws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent than in the past and are expected to continue to become more so 
violation of environmental laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  remedial obligations  and in some cases injunctive relief 
such violations could also result in liabilities for personal injuries  property damage  and other costs and claims 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  also known as cercla or superfund  and related state laws and regulations  liability can be imposed jointly on the entire group of responsible parties or separately on any one of the responsible parties  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
under cercla  such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
changes in federal and state environmental regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 
for example  legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress which would reclassify certain oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes  which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
if enacted  such legislation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making many wells and or oilfields uneconomical to operate 
the oil pollution act of  as amended  contains provisions specifying responsibility for removal costs and damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters or onto the adjoining shorelines 
in addition  the outer continental shelf lands act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites 
because our offshore support vessel operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production  if the government were to exercise its authority under this law to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases  such an action could have a material adverse effect on our offshore support vessel operations 
it is possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization  depending on any responsive action taken by us 
recent legislation could curtail our ability to time charter vessels in us coastwise trade our sea mar division time charters supply vessels to offshore operators in us waters 
the vessels are owned by one of our financing company subsidiaries  but are operated and managed by a us citizen controlled company pursuant to long term bareboat charters 
as a result of recent legislation  beginning in august sea mar will no longer be able to use this arrangement to qualify vessels for employment in the us coastwise trade 
accordingly  we will be required to restructure the arrangement  redeploy the vessels outside the united states  or sell the vessels by no later than such time 
as of december   the net assets of sea mar totaled approximately million 
during sea mar had income before income taxes totaling million 
as a holding company  we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries 
in order to meet our financial needs  we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans made by us to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay upstream dividends or cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of their intercompany loans 
in addition  from time to time  our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements which may contractually restrict or prohibit such upstream payments to us 
there may also be adverse tax consequences associated with making dividend payments upstream 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our common shares since nabors does not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on its common shares 
however  we note that there have been recent positive industry trends and changes in tax law providing more favorable treatment of dividends 
as a result  we can give no assurance that we will not reevaluate our position on dividends in the future 
because our option  warrant and convertible securities holders have a considerable number of common shares available for issuance and resale  significant issuances or resales in the future may adversely affect the market price of our common shares as of february   we had  authorized common shares  of which  shares were outstanding 
in addition   common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to option and employee benefit plans  and  shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures and zero coupon senior exchangeable notes 
in addition  up to  of our common shares could be issuable on exchange of the shares of nabors exchangeco canada inc we also may sell up to million of securities of various types in connection with a shelf registration statement declared effective on january  by the securities and exchange commission 
the sale  or availability for sale  of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market  whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of warrants or options and  where applicable  sales pursuant to rule or the conversion into common shares  or repurchase of debentures and notes using common shares  would be dilutive to existing security holders  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
provisions of our organizational documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium our board of directors is divided into three classes  with each class serving a staggered three year term 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue a significant amount of common shares and up to  preferred shares and to determine the price  rights including voting rights  conversion ratios  preferences and privileges of the preferred shares  in each case without further vote or action by the holders of the common shares 
although we have no present plans to issue preferred shares  the classified board and our board s ability to issue additional preferred shares may discourage  delay or prevent changes in control of nabors that are not supported by our board  thereby possibly preventing certain of our shareholders from realizing a possible premium on their shares 
in addition  the requirement in the indenture for series b of our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due to pay a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the exchange rate in certain circumstances could have the effect of making a change in control of nabors more expensive 
we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding we had approximately billion in debt outstanding at december   resulting in a funded debt to capital ratio of and a net funded debt to capital ratio of both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital 
acquisitions and divestitures we have grown from a land drilling business centered in the us lower  canada and alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil  gas and geothermal markets in the world 
at the beginning of  our fleet consisted of land drilling rigs in canada  alaska and in various international markets 
today  nabors worldwide fleet consists of almost land drilling rigs  approximately domestic and international land workover and well servicing rigs  offshore platform rigs  jack up units  three barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles 
this growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions 
although nabors continues to examine opportunities  there can be no assurance that attractive rigs or other acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in making such acquisitions in the future 
from time to time  we may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business  if it is economically advantageous for us to do so 
environmental compliance nabors does not presently anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change its competitive position  capital spending or earnings during nabors believes it is in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations  and the cost of such compliance is not material to the business or financial condition of nabors 
for a more detailed description of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to nabors operations  see above under risk factors noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect nabors results of operations 
item properties many of the international drilling rigs and certain of the alaska rigs in our fleet are supported by mobile camps which house the drilling crews and a significant inventory of spare parts and supplies 
in addition  we own various trucks  forklifts  cranes  earth moving and other construction and transportation equipment  which are used to support the drilling and logistics operations

shareholder matters 
bermuda has exchange controls which apply to residents in respect of the bermudian dollar 
as an exempt company  nabors is considered to be nonresident for such controls  consequently  there are no bermuda governmental restrictions on the company s ability to make transfers and carry out transactions in all other currencies  including currency of the united states 
there is no reciprocal tax treaty between bermuda and the united states regarding withholding taxes 
under existing bermuda law  there is no bermuda income or withholding tax on dividends  if any  paid by nabors to its shareholders 
furthermore  no bermuda tax or other levy is payable on the sale or other transfer including by gift or on the death of the shareholder of nabors common shares other than by shareholders resident in bermuda

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nature of operations nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world 
we conduct oil  gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the us lower states  alaska  canada  south and central america  the middle east  the far east and africa 
nabors also is one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the united states and canada and is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the united states and multiple international markets 
to further supplement and complement our primary business  we offer a wide range of ancillary well site services  including engineering  transportation  construction  maintenance  well logging  directional drilling  rig instrumentation  data collection and other support services  in selected domestic and international markets 
we have also made selective investments in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
the majority of our business is conducted through our various contract drilling operating segments  which include our drilling  workover and well servicing operations  on land and offshore 
our limited oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are included in a category labeled oil and gas for segment reporting purposes 
our operating segments engaged in marine transportation and supply services  drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in a category labeled other operating segments for segment reporting purposes 
a discussion of our results of operations for the last three years is included below

adjusted income loss derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense from operating revenues and then adding earnings from unconsolidated affiliates 
such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria  including adjusted income loss derived from operating activities  because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to income before income taxes  which is a gaap measure  is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading results of operations above 
the percentage is so large that it is not meaningful

rig hours represents the number of hours that our well servicing rig fleet operated during the year 
the canada well servicing operation was acquired during april as part of our acquisition of enserco energy service company inc compared to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or  compared to adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for totaled million and million per diluted share  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the increase in our operating results during resulted from higher revenues realized by essentially all of our business units as a result of higher activity levels and higher average dayrates during compared to this increase in activity reflects an increase in demand for our services in these markets during  which resulted from continuing higher price levels for natural gas and oil during and natural gas prices are the primary driver of our us lower land drilling  canadian and us offshore gulf of mexico operations  while oil prices are the primary driver of our alaskan  international and us land well servicing operations 
the henry hub natural gas spot price per bloomberg averaged per million cubic feet mcf during  up from a per mcf average during west texas intermediate spot oil prices per bloomberg averaged per barrel during  up from a per barrel average during our operating results for are expected to increase from levels realized during given our current expectation of the continuation of high commodity prices during and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates 
the expected increase in drilling activity and dayrates should have the largest impact on our us lower land drilling and canadian operations 
canadian drilling activity is subject to substantial levels of seasonality  as activity levels typically peak in the first quarter  decline substantially in the second quarter  and then generally increase over the last half of the year 
we also expect an improvement in operating results for our us offshore operations during primarily as a result of higher dayrates and a continuing improvement in the utilization of our workover jack up rigs 
we expect results from our international operations during to increase compared to as a result of new rigs operating under contract in saudi arabia and our expectations of opportunities in various regions of the world  with the largest impact expected from our operations in north africa  the middle east and mexico 
our us land well servicing operations are expected to improve given our expectations of commodity prices during discussed above 
we expect results from our operations in alaska to be reduced overall in compared to  resulting from the lack of demand for drilling services by major operators in that market 
contract drilling our contract drilling operating segments contain one or more of the following operations drilling  workover and well servicing  on land and offshore 
operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for these operating segments totaled billion and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million during  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to rig years excluding well servicing rigs increased to years during from years during  as a result of increased capital spending by our customers  which resulted from the improvement in commodity prices discussed above 
us lower land drilling operating revenues totaled million during  representing an increase of compared to adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million during compared to million during the increase in operating results during primarily resulted from increased drilling activity  which was driven by higher natural gas prices and is reflected in the increase in rig years to years during from years during  and higher average dayrates compared to the prior year 
us land well servicing operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million and million  respectively  during  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the increase in operating results during primarily resulted from an increase in average dayrates compared to the prior year and an increase in well servicing activity  which was driven by higher oil prices and is reflected in the increase in well servicing hours to  hours during compared to  hours during us offshore operating revenues totaled million during  representing an increase of compared to adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million during compared to million during the increase in operating results during primarily resulted from the addition of three new platform rigs for deepwater development projects  one of which commenced operations in the first quarter of  and two of which commenced operations late in the second quarter of our us offshore operations were also positively impacted by an increase in average dayrates for our platform and jack up rigs during compared to rig years for our us offshore operations were relatively flat during compared to  totaling years for compared to years during alaskan operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million and million  respectively  during  representing decreases of and  respectively  compared to these decreases primarily resulted from lower drilling activity  deferred revenue recognized on one of our rigs in that did not recur in  and an incremental million of operating revenues recorded in the first quarter of  representing business interruption insurance proceeds related to the damage incurred on one of our land drilling rigs 
the decrease in drilling activity during primarily resulted from the completion of a significant long term contract in late that has not yet been renewed or replaced and is reflected in the decrease in rig years to years during from years during canadian operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million and million  respectively  during  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to these increases resulted from an increase in drilling and well servicing revenues  resulting from an overall increase in drilling and well servicing activity which was driven by increased natural gas prices  and an increase in average dayrates compared to the prior year 
rig years in canada increased to years during from years during well servicing hours increased to  hours during from  hours during our canadian results were also positively impacted by the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar during international operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million and million  respectively  during  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the increase in operating results during primarily resulted from an increase in operations in mexico and saudi arabia and from the addition of operations in india and indonesia  which began in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a decrease in operations in trinidad  yemen  colombia and algeria compared to the prior year 
international rig years increased to years during from years during oil and gas this operating segment represents our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  which we conduct in multiple locations  including south texas  north louisiana  south louisiana  offshore gulf of mexico  and colombia 
oil and gas operating revenues increased to million during from million during adjusted income derived from operating activities increased to million during from million during operating results increased during as a result of new investments in oil and gas properties resulting from the agreements executed with el paso corporation in the fourth quarter of the increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities for was partially offset by million in expense included in direct costs in our consolidated statements of income recognized during the second quarter of as a result of a dry hole offshore in the gulf of mexico  which exceeded million in expense recognized during the fourth quarter of as a result of a dry hole also in the gulf of mexico 
in the fourth quarter of we entered into four separate agreements with wholly owned subsidiaries of el paso corporation resulting in the significant expansion of our oil and gas operations 
under two of these agreements  we are committed to contribute a portion of the cost to develop wells with a combination of proved undeveloped  probable and possible reserves located primarily in south texas  north louisiana and offshore gulf of mexico  in exchange for a net profits interest in such wells 
el paso serves as operator of all the wells covered in this development program 
under the other two agreements with el paso  we have committed to share in the cost of drilling exploratory wells in south texas and south louisiana in exchange for a share in the prospect leases where the wells are drilled 
based on our current estimation of oil and gas production levels  we expect to receive returns from the wells under the developmental drilling program through the first quarter of and from the successful wells drilled to date under the exploratory drilling program through additionally  in may  we entered into agreements under which we will contribute a portion of the cost to drill exploration and developmental wells in colombia in exchange for an interest in each of the prospects 
the terms of the agreements call for an estimated three year exploratory drilling program and  for any successful prospects  up to an additional year developmental drilling program 
we also make investments in oil and gas properties with several of our customers 
based on our current estimation of future oil and gas production levels  we expect to receive returns from these investments through other operating segments these operations include our marine transportation and supply services  drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations 
operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our other operating segments totaled million during  representing an increase of compared to this increase primarily resulted from an increase in revenues for our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  and rig instrumentation and software operations during compared to this increase in revenues was primarily driven by the strengthening in the drilling market in the us and canada during as discussed for our contract drilling segments above 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues for our marine and supply services operations resulting from the consolidation of sea mar management llc beginning in see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item and a decrease in average dayrates during compared to  which resulted from the loss of some higher rate contracts during the first quarter of and from an increase in the impact of competition in the markets in which we operate during adjusted loss derived from operating activities totaled million during compared to adjusted income derived from operating activities totaling million during this decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in results for our alaskan construction and logistics operations compared to  which resulted from certain projects in that did not recur in and the loss of a significant contract during the second quarter of  and decreased margins from our marine transportation and supply services  which was driven by lower average dayrates compared to other financial information general and administrative expenses totaled million during  representing an increase of million  or  compared to this increase primarily resulted from increased activity in a number of our operating segments including our us lower land drilling  us land well servicing and canadian operations  and from increased expenses at our corporate level 
as a percentage of operating revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased vs 
during compared to  as these expenses were spread over a larger revenue base 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled million during  representing an increase of million  or  compared to this increase primarily resulted from an increase in average rig years for our us lower land drilling  canadian land drilling and international operations compared to the prior year  and depreciation on capital expenditures made during and depletion expense totaled million during compared to million during this increase resulted from depletion on oil and gas properties added through our agreements with el paso corporation in the fourth quarter of interest expense totaled million during  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to this decrease resulted from the payment upon maturity of our senior notes in april and the redemption of our million zero coupon convertible senior debentures in june in june we issued million in zero coupon senior exchangeable notes  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our million senior debentures 
the million notes will not accrue interest unless we become obligated to pay contingent interest  while our million senior debentures had an effective interest rate of 
the amount of contingent interest payable per note in respect to any six month period will equal of the principal amount of a note commencing on or after june  only if certain conditions relating to the trading price of the notes are met see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item for a more detailed description 
investment income totaled million during  representing an increase of million  or  compared to this increase primarily resulted from an increase in gains realized on sales of marketable securities and an increase in gains realized upon redemption of non marketable securities during this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash and marketable securities balances in compared to and from lower average yields on our investments driven by an overall declining interest rate environment 
gains losses on sales of long lived assets  impairment charges and other income expense  net increased to million during from million during these amounts for include mark to market gains on our range cap and floor derivative instrument of approximately million 
these amounts for include the recognition of approximately million of expense related to the settlement of amounts due to the counterparty for our range cap and floor derivative instrument offset by mark to market gains on that derivative instrument of 
million and a loss of approximately 
million resulting from the redemption of our senior subordinated notes at prices higher than their carrying value on april   partially offset by gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately million 
our effective income tax benefit rate was during compared to for the change from an income tax benefit in to an income tax expense in resulted from a higher proportion of our taxable income being generated in the us for compared to income generated in the us is generally taxed at a higher rate than in international jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate for was also positively impacted by the release of certain tax reserves  which were determined to no longer be necessary  resulting in a reduction in deferred income tax expense non cash totaling approximately million 
per diluted share 
in october the us congress passed and the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the act did not impact the corporate reorganization completed by nabors effective june   that made us a foreign entity 
it is possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization  depending on any responsive action taken by nabors 
we expect our effective tax rate during to be in the range because we expect a high proportion of our income to be generated in the us  which is generally taxed at a higher rate than in international jurisdictions in which we operate 
compared to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or  compared to adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for totaled million and million per diluted share  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the increase in our operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during primarily resulted from higher revenues realized by our canadian  us lower land drilling and international operations 
the improved revenues from our canadian operations resulted from an increase in the level of activity for our land drilling and well servicing operations driven by increased demand for our services in that market during and our acquisition of enserco energy service company inc in april the enserco acquisition increased the number of drilling rigs owned and operated by nabors in canada by drilling rigs while also adding over well servicing rigs 
the improved revenues for our us lower land drilling operations resulted from higher activity levels driven by a gradual increase in demand for drilling services in that market during the overall increase in demand in these markets was driven by higher average price levels for natural gas in compared to international revenues improved primarily as a result of six new long term contracts for our operation in mexico 
the increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities during primarily resulted from the increase in revenues discussed above 
however  the overall increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities for was partially offset by lower average dayrates in our us lower land drilling operations during and lower margins realized by certain of our other operating segments 
the decrease in average dayrates for our us lower land drilling operations resulted from dayrates declining during and remaining flat until the latter part of when dayrates began to rise 
this decline in dayrates during resulted from the weakness in this market over the period beginning in the third quarter of and extending through the end of the decrease in margins for our other operating segments is discussed in detail below 
as discussed above  natural gas prices are the primary driver of our us lower land drilling  canadian and us offshore operations  while oil prices are the primary driver of our alaskan  international and us land well servicing operations

alaskan operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million and million  respectively  in  representing a decrease of and an increase of  respectively  compared to the decrease in operating revenues resulted from lower drilling activity reflected in the decrease in rig years to years during from years during  which was primarily driven by two of our customers decreasing their level of winter exploration activity 
this reduced activity level was partially offset by an incremental million of operating revenues  representing business interruption insurance proceeds recorded during related to the damage incurred on one of our land drilling rigs in  which exceeded the million in business interruption insurance proceeds recorded during related to another rig damaged in the increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities resulted from the higher level of business interruption insurance proceeds recognized in than in and from projects where we earned a standby with crew rate  which adds to revenues at a level lower than standard rates  but with minimal costs of operation 
canadian operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million and million  respectively  in  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to these increases reflect an increase in drilling and well servicing revenues  which resulted from an overall increase in canadian drilling and well servicing activity driven by increased commodity prices  and from our acquisition of enserco in april rig years in canada increased to years during from years during canadian well servicing hours totaled  hours during compared to  hours during the period from april   the date we acquired enserco  through december  international operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled million and million  respectively  in  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the improved results in primarily resulted from six new long term contracts for our operation in mexico

our effective income benefit tax rate was during compared to during the tax benefit position for resulted primarily from tax savings realized as a result of our corporate reorganization effective june  liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash flows primarily depend on the level of spending by our customers  oil and gas companies  for exploration  development and production activities 
sustained increases or decreases in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on these activities  and could also materially affect our cash flows 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  purchases and sales of marketable securities  issuances and repurchases of debt  and repurchases of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during during and net income was increased for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  and depletion  and was reduced for changes in our working capital and other balance sheet accounts

our billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures can be put to us on february   february  and february   for a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of repurchase 
the amount of the purchase price would total million  million and billion if the debentures were put to us on february   february  or february   respectively 
additionally  each of our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes and our billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures provide that upon an exchange or conversion  as applicable  of these convertible debt instruments  we will be required to pay holders of these debt instruments  in lieu of common shares  cash up to the principal amount of the instruments and  at our option  consideration in the form of either cash or our common shares for any amount above the principal amount of the instruments required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the indentures 
as our billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures can be converted at any time resulting in our payment of cash  the outstanding principal amount of these debentures of million is included in current liabilities in our balance sheet as of december  these debentures previously would have been classified in current liabilities beginning in the first quarter of as a result of the holders having the option to put the debentures to us on february  if the billion debentures were converted  our cash obligation would be an amount equal to the lesser of million multiplied by the sale price of our common shares on the trading day immediately prior to the related conversion date or the principal amount of the debentures on the date of conversion 
if these debentures had been converted on december   we would have been required to pay cash totaling approximately million to the holders of the debentures based on the closing price for our common shares on december  of 
as this amount is substantially lower than the million that the holders of the debentures will receive if they put the debentures to us on the first put date of february  or if they sold the debentures in the open market  we do not currently expect the debentures to be converted and any payment to be required prior to february  when the holders have the option to put the debentures back to us  unless the price for our shares were to exceed approximately our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes cannot be exchanged until the price for our shares exceeds approximately or in various other circumstances as described in the note indenture see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately million  primarily for rig related enhancing and sustaining capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures for are currently expected to be approximately million  including currently planned rig related enhancing and sustaining capital expenditures 
this amount could change significantly based on market conditions and new business opportunities 
we have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations 
several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of our common shares 
future acquisitions may be paid for using existing cash or issuance of debt or nabors shares 
such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors

purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during our board of directors authorized the continuation of a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase our common shares in the open market 
under this program we are authorized to purchase up to million of our common shares 
through december   approximately million of our common shares have been repurchased under this program 
financial condition and sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  marketable and non marketable securities and cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non marketable securities of billion including million of long term marketable and non marketable securities and working capital of million 
this compares to cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non marketable securities of billion including million of long term marketable securities and working capital of million as of december  our funded debt to capital ratio was as of december  and as of december  our net funded debt to capital ratio was as of december  and as of december  the funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing funded debt by funded debt plus capital 
funded debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  current portion of long term debt and long term debt 
capital is defined as shareholders equity 
the net funded debt to capital ratio nets cash and cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities against funded debt 
this ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net funded debt plus capital 
both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital 
non marketable securities consist of investments in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private us and us securities including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities  global structured asset securitizations  whole loan mortgages  and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages 
these investments are classified as non marketable  because they do not have published fair values  and are recorded at cost in our consolidated balance sheets the current portion is classified as non marketable securities under current assets and the long term portion is included as a component of other long term assets 
our interest coverage ratio was as of december   compared to as of december  the interest coverage ratio is computed by calculating the sum of income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense and then dividing by interest expense 
this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of cash flows available to cover interest expense 
we have three letter of credit facilities with various banks as of december  availability and borrowings under our credit facilities as of december  are as follows in thousands credit available  letters of credit outstanding  remaining availability  we have a shelf registration statement on file with the us securities and exchange commission to allow us to offer  from time to time  up to million in debt securities  guarantees of debt securities  preferred shares  depository shares  common shares  share purchase contracts  share purchase units and warrants 
we currently have not issued any securities registered under this registration statement 
our current cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable and non marketable securities and projected cash flow generated from current operations are expected to more than adequately finance our sustaining capital expenditures  our debt service requirements  and all other expected cash requirements for the next twelve months

off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees we are a party to certain transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as off balance sheet arrangements that could have a material future effect on our financial position  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
the most significant of these off balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations in which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties 
certain of these agreements serve as guarantees  including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program  other financial surety instruments such as bonds  and guarantees of residual value in certain of our operating lease agreements 
we have also guaranteed payment of contingent consideration in conjunction with an acquisition in  which is based on future operating results of that business 
in addition  we have provided indemnifications to certain third parties which serve as guarantees 
these guarantees include indemnification provided by nabors to our stock transfer agent and our insurance carriers 
we are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees 
management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote

recent accounting pronouncements we currently account for stock based compensation as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and because we grant options at prices equal to the market price of our shares on the date of the grant we do not record compensation expense related to these grants 
in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment  which will eliminate our ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and instead would require us to account for stock option awards using a fair value based method resulting in compensation expense for stock option awards 
the statement will be effective for stock options granted  modified  or settled in cash in interim and annual periods beginning after june  additionally  for stock options granted or modified after december  that have not vested as of the effective date of the statement  compensation cost will be measured and recorded based on the same estimates of fair value calculated as of the date of grant as currently disclosed within the table required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation an amendment to fas  presented in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the statement may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations during the periods of adoption and annual and interim periods thereafter 
if this statement had been adopted in its current form as of january   we would have recorded additional compensation expense  net of related tax effects  of approximately million during and our diluted earnings per share for would have been reduced by 
per share 
in october the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in eitf  which addresses the issue of when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share computations 
based on the concepts described in eitf  we will be required to treat our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes as converted for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share  regardless of whether any triggering contingency has been met or is likely to be met 
the provisions in eitf are effective for periods ending after december   including the year ended december  as a result of this accounting change  we are required to include additional common shares in the denominator of our diluted earnings per share calculation in all periods where the price for our shares exceeds 
these additional shares represent the value in excess of the principal amount of the notes and would be calculated using the treasury stock method 
we do not expect this accounting change to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
in december the fasb issued a revision to fin  interpretation no

application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application for all other types of vies is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  our adoption of fin r on march  did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended december  related party transactions pursuant to his employment agreement entered into in october  we provided an unsecured  non interest bearing loan of approximately million to nabors deputy chairman  president and chief operating officer 
this loan is due on september  pursuant to their employment agreements  nabors and its chairman and chief executive officer  deputy chairman  president and chief operating officer  and certain other key employees entered into split dollar life insurance agreements pursuant to which we pay a portion of the premiums under life insurance policies with respect to these individuals and  in certain instances  members of their families 
under these agreements  we are reimbursed for such premiums upon the occurrence of specified events  including the death of an insured individual 
any recovery of premiums paid by nabors could potentially be limited to the cash surrender value of these policies under certain circumstances 
as such  the values of these policies are recorded at their respective cash surrender values in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have made premium payments to date totaling million related to these policies 
the cash surrender value of these policies of approximately million and million is included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
under the sarbanes oxley act of  the payment of premiums by nabors under the agreements with our chairman and chief executive officer and with our deputy chairman  president and chief operating officer may be deemed to be prohibited loans by us to these individuals

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidation financial position or results of operations 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment the drilling  workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive 
property  plant and equipment represented of our total assets as of december   and depreciation constituted of our total costs and other deductions for the year ended december  depreciation for our primary operating assets  drilling and workover rigs  is calculated based on the units of production method over an approximate  day period  with the exception of our jack up rigs which are depreciated over an  day period  after provision for salvage value 
when our drilling and workover rigs are not operating  a depreciation charge is provided using the straight line method over an assumed depreciable life of years  with the exception of our jack up rigs  where a year depreciable life is used 
depreciation on our buildings  well servicing rigs  oilfield hauling and mobile equipment  marine transportation and supply vessels  and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value buildings to years  well servicing rigs to years  marine transportation and supply vessels to years  oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment to years 
these depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property  plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets 
periodically  we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets 
estimation of these items requires significant management judgment 
accordingly  management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property  plant and equipment are critical 
there have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets  changes in technology or other factors that indicate that these lives do not continue to be appropriate 
accordingly  for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property  plant and equipment  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation  or the methodology applied 
however  certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed above  the drilling  workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive  which is evident in the fact that our property  plant and equipment represented of our total assets as of december  other long lived assets subject to impairment consist primarily of goodwill  which represented of our total assets as of december  we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable 
such determination requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review in order to determine the future cash flows associated with the asset or  in the case of goodwill  our reporting units 
these long term forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions  technological advances in the industry  and changes in regulations governing the industry 
significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
as the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long lived assets is subject to significant management judgment and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income  management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long lived assets is critical 
assumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows 
given the nature of the evaluation of future cash flows and the application to specific assets and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
income taxes deferred taxes represent a substantial liability for nabors 
for financial reporting purposes  management determines our current tax liability as well as those taxes incurred as a result of current operations yet deferred until future periods 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred 
currently payable taxes represent the liability related to our income tax return for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
the changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse 
in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences  management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary  management must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management has considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these judgments and estimates are made for each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the calculation of deferred taxes is completed at that level 
further  under us federal tax law  the amount and availability of loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests applicable to nabors and our subsidiaries 
the utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or effectively lost upon certain changes in ownership 
accordingly  although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us  no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards  or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future 
these loss carryforwards are also considered in our calculation of taxes for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
additionally  we record reserves for uncertain tax positions which are subject to a significant level of management judgment related to the ultimate resolution of those tax positions 
accordingly  management believes that the estimate related to the provision for income taxes is critical to our results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes 
however  certain events could occur that would materially affect management s estimates and assumptions regarding the deferred portion of our income tax provision  including estimates of future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences  the classification of timing differences as temporary or permanent  reserves recorded for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded as a reduction to our deferred tax assets 
management s assumptions related to the preparation of our income tax provision have historically proved to be reasonable in light of the ultimate amount tax liability due in all taxing jurisdictions 
for the year ended december   our provision for income taxes was million  consisting of million of current tax expense and million of deferred tax expense 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes 
changes in these assumptions could potentially change the effective tax rate 
a change in the effective tax rate from to would increase the current year income tax provision by approximately million 
insurance reserves our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling  workover and well servicing industries  including blowouts  cratering  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
we maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability and automobile liability claims 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
these loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  and such liabilities could be material in nature  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to estimate insurance reserves 
for purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis  if the december  reserves for insurance were adjusted increase or decreased by  total costs and other deductions would have changed by million  or 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed we have completed a number of large acquisitions in recent years as discussed in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with our accounting for these acquisitions  it was necessary for us to estimate the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the various business combinations  which involved the use of various assumptions 
these estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property  plant and equipment  and the resulting amount of goodwill  if any 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions and could result in lower estimates of values of acquired assets or of future cash flows 
this could result in impairment charges being recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
as the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical 
the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities are based on the market for the assets and the settlement value of the liabilities 
these estimates are made by management based on our experience with similar assets and liabilities 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to value assets acquired or liabilities assumed 
as we have not recorded any significant impairment charges on property  plant and equipment or goodwill in either of the years ended december   and  our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have proved to be reliable 
given the nature of the evaluation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the application to specific assets and liabilities  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  interest rates  and marketable and non marketable security prices as discussed below 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  which exposes us to foreign exchange rate risk 
the most significant exposures arise in connection with our operations in canada  which usually are substantially unhedged 
at various times  we utilize local currency borrowings foreign currency denominated debt  the payment structure of customer contracts and foreign exchange contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities  cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies 
a foreign exchange contract is a foreign currency transaction  defined as an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given future date and at a specified rate 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of all our foreign currencies relative to the us dollar as of december  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
credit risk our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  investments and marketable and non marketable securities  accounts receivable  and our interest rate swap and range cap and floor transactions 
cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks or investment firms 
our investments in marketable and non marketable securities are managed within established guidelines which limit the amounts that may be invested with any one issuer and which provide guidance as to issuer credit quality 
we believe that the credit risk in such instruments is minimal 
in addition  our trade receivables are with a variety of us  international and foreign country national oil and gas companies 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require material collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
interest rate  and marketable and non marketable security price risk our financial instruments that are potentially sensitive to changes in interest rates include our billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures  our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes  our and senior notes  our interest rate swap and range cap and floor transactions  our investments in debt securities including corporate  asset backed  us government  government agencies  foreign government  mortgage backed debt and mortgage cmo debt securities and our investment in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private us and us securities including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities  global structured asset securitizations  whole loan mortgages  and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages  which are classified as non marketable securities 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments that are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
the use of derivative financial instruments could expose us to further credit risk and market risk 
credit risk in this context is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty would owe us  which can create credit risk for us 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we would owe the counterparty  and therefore  we would not be exposed to credit risk 
we attempt to minimize credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with major financial institutions that have a significant asset base 
market risk related to derivatives is the adverse effect to the value of a financial instrument that results from changes in interest rates 
we try to manage market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the type and degree of market risk that we undertake 
our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes include a contingent interest provision  discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  which qualifies as an embedded derivative under sfas  as amended by sfas this embedded derivative is required to be separated from the notes and valued at its fair value at the inception of the note indenture 
any subsequent change in fair value of this embedded derivative would be recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of the contingent interest provision at inception of the note indenture was nominal 
in addition  there was no significant change in the fair value of this embedded derivative through december   resulting in no impact on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  on october   we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a third party financial institution to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of million of our fixed rate senior notes due  which has been designated as a fair value hedge under sfas  as amended by sfas additionally  on october   we purchased a libor range cap and sold a libor floor  in the form of a cashless collar  with the same third party financial institution with the intention of mitigating and managing our exposure to changes in the three month us dollar libor rate 
this transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  as amended by sfas  and any change in the cumulative fair value of this transaction will be reflected as a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded interest savings related to our interest rate swap agreement accounted for as a fair value hedge of million  million and million  respectively  which served to reduce interest expense 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement is recorded as a derivative asset  included in other long term assets  and totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased by the same amount as of december  and the fair value of our range cap and floor transaction is recorded as a derivative asset  included in other long term assets  and totaled approximately 
million as of december   and is recorded as a derivative liability  included in other long term liabilities  and totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in june we unwound million of the million range cap and floor derivative instrument 
we recorded gains of approximately million and losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to this derivative instrument  such amounts are included in losses gains on sales of long lived assets  impairment charges and other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a hypothetical adverse shift in quoted interest rates as of december  would decrease the fair values of our interest rate swap  and range cap and floor  by approximately million and 
million  respectively 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third party financial institutions 
the carrying and fair values of our long term debt  including the current portion  are as follows december  effective effective interest carrying interest carrying rate value fair value rate value fair value in thousands  except interest rates senior notes due august     senior notes due august     million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due june     billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures due february     senior notes due april n a   other long term debt   includes the effect of interest savings realized from the interest rate swap executed on october  includes million and million related to the fair value of the interest rate swap as of december  and  respectively 
represents the rate at which accretion of the original discount at issuance of these debentures is charged to interest expense 
our senior notes due april were redeemed upon maturity in april the fair values of our cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables approximate their carrying values due to the short term nature of these instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities are included in the table below

our investments in marketable debt securities listed in the above table and a portion of our investment in non marketable securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
additionally  our investment portfolio of marketable debt and equity securities  which are carried at fair value  expose us to price risk 
a hypothetical decrease in the market prices for all marketable securities as of december  would decrease the fair value of our available for sale securities by million
