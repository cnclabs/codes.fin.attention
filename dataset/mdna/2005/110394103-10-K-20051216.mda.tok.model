executive overview we are a leading provider of helicopter transportation services to the worldwide offshore oil and gas industry with major operations in the us gulf of mexico and the north sea 
we also have operations  both directly and indirectly  in most of the other major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including australia  brazil  china  mexico  nigeria  russia and trinidad 
additionally  we are a leading provider of production 
table of contents management services for oil and gas production facilities in the us gulf of mexico 
as of march   we operated aircraft and our unconsolidated affiliates operated an additional aircraft throughout the world 
market outlook worldwide demand for hydrocarbons is expected to continue to grow for the foreseeable future 
this growth  driven largely by economic expansion  is expected to result in sustained strength in oil and natural gas prices  driving further increases in offshore exploration and development activity by our customers 
this increase in offshore exploration and development activity is also likely to lead to growth in production related activities as these development projects come on stream 
as a result of the current commodity price environment  we have experienced an increase in aircraft fleet utilization in all of our present markets and expect this trend to continue 
in addition  as operators increasingly pursue prospects in deepwater and push further offshore  we expect demand for medium and large helicopters to be further stimulated 
in particular  we expect growth in demand for additional helicopter support in north and south america  west africa and asia  including the caspian sea region 
this growth will provide us with opportunities to add new aircraft to our fleet  as well as opportunities to redeploy aircraft from weaker markets into markets that will sustain higher rates for our services 
currently  helicopter manufacturers are indicating very limited supply availability during the next three years 
we expect that this tightness in aircraft availability from the manufacturers and the lack of suitable aircraft in the secondary market  coupled with the increase in demand for helicopter support  will result in upward pressure on the rates we charge for our services 
at the same time  we believe that our recent aircraft acquisitions and commitments position us to capture a portion of the upside created by the current market conditions 
current activity levels in the gulf of mexico are at or near all time highs 
in the near term  we also believe that the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita will result in higher activity levels as operators repair facilities and work to bring production back on line 
furthermore  our north sea activities are under strong pricing pressure as one particular competitor is aggressively seeking to gain market share with lower rates 
at the same time  while contracts in the north sea are generally long term  we have experienced a recent trend of increased spot market contracting of helicopters as exploration activity has increased in the north sea 
our other international operations have experienced high aircraft utilization and we expect this trend to continue 
due to the current high levels of fleet utilization  we have experienced  along with other helicopter operators  some difficulty in meeting our customers needs for short notice exploration drilling support  particularly in remote international locations 
our operations in nigeria and a south american country are likely to be negatively affected as a result of our actions taken in connection with the internal review  as discussed in more detail below under investigations

see item legal proceedings above and restatement of previously reported amounts in note a and internal review in note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these matters 
amounts for fiscal year were not previously audited or filed with the sec  but had been announced 
amounts for the first three fiscal quarters in that year had been filed 
investigations in february  we voluntarily advised the staff of the sec that the audit committee of our board of directors had engaged special outside counsel to undertake a review of certain payments made by two of our affiliated entities in a foreign country 
the internal review  which initially focused on foreign corrupt practices act matters  was subsequently expanded to cover operations in other countries and other issues 
in connection with this review  special outside counsel to the audit committee retained forensic accountants 
the sec then notified us that it had initiated an informal inquiry and requested that we provide certain documents on a voluntary basis 
subsequently  the sec advised us that the inquiry had become an investigation 
we have responded to the sec s requests for documents and are continuing to do so 
the internal review is complete and the accompanying financial statements reflect all known required restatements 
as a follow up to matters identified during the course of the internal review  special counsel to the audit committee is completing certain work  and may be called upon to undertake additional work in the future to 
table of contents assist in responding to inquiries from the sec  from other governmental authorities or customers  or as follow up to the steps being performed by special counsel 
in october  the audit committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings to date from the internal review 
the audit committee concluded that  over a considerable period of time  a improper payments were made by  and on behalf of  certain foreign affiliated entities directly or indirectly to employees of the nigerian government  b improper payments were made by certain foreign affiliated entities to nigerian employees of certain customers with whom we have contracts  c inadequate employee payroll declarations and  in certain instances  tax payments were made by us or our affiliated entities in certain jurisdictions  d inadequate valuations for customs purposes may have been declared in certain jurisdictions resulting in the underpayment of import duties  and e an affiliated entity in a south american country  with the assistance of our personnel and two of our other affiliated entities  engaged in transactions which appear to have assisted the south american entity in the circumvention of currency transfer restrictions and other regulations 
in addition  as a result of the internal review  the audit committee and management determined that there were deficiencies in our books and records and internal controls with respect to the foregoing and certain other activities 
based on the audit committee s findings and recommendations  the board of directors has taken disciplinary action with respect to our personnel who it determined bore responsibility for these matters 
the disciplinary actions included termination or resignation of employment including certain members of senior management  changes of job responsibility  reductions in incentive compensation payments and reprimands 
one of our affiliates has also obtained the resignation of certain of its personnel 
we have initiated remedial action  including initiating action to correct underreporting of payroll tax  disclose to certain customers inappropriate payments made to customer personnel and terminate certain agency  business and joint venture relationships 
we also have taken steps to reinforce our commitment to conduct our business with integrity by creating an internal corporate compliance function  instituting a new code of business conduct our new code of business conduct entitled code of business integrity is available on our website  http www 
olog 
com  and developing and implementing a training program for all employees 
in addition to the disciplinary actions referred to above  we have also taken steps to strengthen our control environment by hiring new personnel and realigning reporting lines within the accounting function so that field accounting reports directly to the corporate accounting function instead of operations management 
following the audit committee s conclusions  we initiated the process of voluntarily advising governmental authorities in certain countries of the audit committee s findings 
we have not yet advised such foreign governmental authorities of the audit committee findings  but intend to do so 
such disclosure may result in legal and administrative proceedings  the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving us and or current or former employees  officers and or directors who are within the jurisdictions of such authorities  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  including precluding us from participating in business operations in their countries 
to the extent that violations of the law may have occurred in several countries in which we operate  we do not yet know whether such violations can be cured merely by the payment of fines or whether other actions may be taken against us  including requiring us to curtail our business operations in one or more such countries for a period of time 
in the event that we curtail our business operations in any such country  we may face difficulties exporting our aircraft 
as of september   the book values of our aircraft in nigeria and the south american country where certain improper activities took place were approximately million and million  respectively 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the sec investigation  nor can we predict whether other applicable us and foreign governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations 
the outcome of the sec investigation and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving us and or current or former employees  officers and or directors  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  modifications to business practices and compliance programs and or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions 
it is not possible to accurately predict at this time when matters relating to the sec investigation will be completed  the final outcome of the sec investigation  what if any actions may be taken by the sec or by other governmental agencies in the us or in foreign jurisdictions  or the effect that such actions may have on our consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
in addition  in view of the findings of the internal review  we expect to encounter difficulties in the future conducting business in nigeria and a south american country  and with certain customers 
it is also possible that certain of our existing contracts may be cancelled and that we may become subject to claims by third parties  possibly resulting in litigation 
the matters identified in the internal review and their effects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with its conclusions regarding payroll declarations and tax payments  the audit committee determined on november   following the recommendation of our senior management  that there is a need to restate our historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal years    and and for quarterly periods in fiscal year we have accrued million for the taxes  penalties and interest attributable to underreported employee payroll 
operating income for fiscal year includes million attributable to this accrual  and the remainder has been reported as adjustments to amounts previously reported for fiscal year and earlier 
at this time  we cannot estimate what additional payments  fines  penalties and or litigation and related expenses may be required in connection with the matters identified as a result of the internal review  the sec investigation  any other regulatory investigation that may be instituted or third party litigation  however  such payments  fines  penalties and or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we continue to respond to the sec investigation and other governmental authorities and take other actions relating to improper activities that have been identified in connection with the internal review  there can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required or that the historical financial statements included in this annual report will not change or require amendment 
in addition  new issues may be identified that may impact our financial statements and the scope of the restatements described in this annual report and lead us to take other remedial actions or otherwise adversely impact our company 
for fiscal year  we have incurred approximately million in legal and other professional costs in connection with the internal review 
during the first two quarters of fiscal year  we incurred an additional million in legal and other professional costs related to the internal review 
we expect to incur additional costs associated with the internal review  which will be expensed as incurred and which could be significant in the fiscal quarters in which they are recorded 
as a result of the disclosure and remediation of a number of activities identified in the internal review  we expect to encounter difficulties conducting business in certain foreign countries and retaining and attracting additional business with certain customers 
we cannot predict the extent of these difficulties  however  our ability to continue conducting business in these countries and with these customers may be significantly impacted 
we have commenced actions to disclose activities in nigeria identified in the internal review to affected customers  and one or more of these customers may seek to cancel their contracts with us 
one of such customers already has commenced its own investigation 
among other things  we have been advised that such customer intends to exercise its rights to audit a specific contract  as well as to review its other relations with us 
although we have no indication as to what the final outcome of the audit and review will be  it is possible that such customer may seek to cancel one or more existing contracts if it believes that they were improperly obtained or that we breached any of their terms 
since our customers in nigeria are affiliates of major international petroleum companies  with whom we do business throughout the world  any actions which are taken by certain customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations  and these customers may preclude us from bidding on future business with them either locally or on a worldwide basis 
in addition  applicable governmental authorities may preclude us from bidding on contracts to provide services in the countries where improper activities took place 
in connection with the internal review  we also have terminated our business relationship with certain agents and have taken actions to terminate business relationships with other agents 
one of the terminated agents has commenced litigation against two of our foreign affiliated entities claiming damages of million for breach of contract 
we may be required to indemnify certain of our agents to the extent that regulatory authorities seek to hold them responsible in connection with activities identified in the internal review 

table of contents in a south american country where certain improper activities took place  we are negotiating to terminate our ownership interest in the joint venture that provides us with the local ownership content necessary to meet local regulatory requirements for operating in that country 
during fiscal year  we derived approximately million of leasing and other revenues  of which million was paid by us to a third party for the use of the aircraft  and approximately million of dividend income from this joint venture 
without a joint venture partner  we will be unable to maintain an operating license and our future activities in that country may be limited to leasing our aircraft to unrelated operating companies 
our joint venture partners and agents are typically influential members of the local business community and instrumental in aiding us in obtaining contracts and managing our affairs in the local country 
as a result of terminating these relationships  our ability to continue conducting business in these countries where the improper activities took place may be negatively affected 
we may not be successful in our negotiations to terminate our ownership interest in the joint venture  and the outcome of such negotiations may negatively affect our ability to continue leasing our aircraft to the joint venture or other unrelated operating companies or conducting other business in that country  to export our aircraft or to recover our investment in the joint venture 
many of the improper actions identified in the internal review resulted in decreasing the costs incurred by us in performing our services 
the remedial actions we are taking will result in an increase in these costs and  if we cannot raise our prices simultaneously and to the same extent of our increased costs  our operating income will decrease 
on june   we issued a press release disclosing that one of our subsidiaries received a document subpoena from the antitrust division of the doj 
the subpoena pertains to a grand jury investigation of potential antitrust violations among providers of helicopter transportation services in the us gulf of mexico 
we are continuing to investigate this matter and intend to comply with requests for information from the doj in connection with this investigation 
the outcome of the doj investigation and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include civil injunctive or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  referral to other governmental agencies and or the payment of damages in civil litigation 
to date  we have not identified any material adjustments to our financial statements in connection with the investigation and do not expect  based on information developed to date  that any such adjustment is likely to be required 
we expect to incur costs associated with this investigation  which will be expensed as incurred and which could be significant in the fiscal quarters in which they are recorded 
for additional information regarding the sec and doj investigations  see item legal proceedings 
restatement of previously reported amounts as a result of the internal review findings discussed above  we have restated our historical financial statements to accrue for payroll taxes  penalties and interest attributable to underreported employee payroll 
in connection with this matter  our restated consolidated statements of income reflect reductions in operating income of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  and million for earlier fiscal years from previously reported amounts 
in addition  our consolidated statements of income reflect reductions in operating income of million for fiscal year from the previously announced amount 
at this time  we cannot estimate what additional payments  fines and or penalties may be required in connection with the matters identified as a result of the internal review or the sec investigation  however  such payments  fines and or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our management has separately determined that we were not reporting reimbursements received from our customers for costs incurred on their behalf in accordance with gaap 
our customers reimburse us for certain costs incurred on their behalf  which have historically been recorded by offsetting such amounts against the related expenses 
in addition  our management has determined that we did not properly record expenses related to severance benefits for certain employees of a foreign subsidiary and we did not properly record expenses related to payroll taxes incurred by one of our foreign subsidiaries 
in accordance with gaap  we have restated our historical financial statements for fiscal years and to reflect such reimbursement as an increase in revenue and a corresponding increase in expense  and we increased direct costs to reflect the severance obligation and payroll taxes in the applicable periods 
with respect to customer reimbursements  operating revenues and direct costs were increased million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  from previously reported 
table of contents amounts  with no impact on income from operations or net income 
with respect to the severance benefits and payroll taxes  direct costs were increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
for all three items  operating revenues were increased million and direct costs were increased by million from the previously announced amount for fiscal year amounts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year were not previously audited or filed with the sec  but had been announced 
amounts for the first three fiscal quarters in that year had been filed 
the impact of these adjustments on the consolidated statement of income  balance sheet and cash flows is reflected in the tables below in thousands except per share amounts fiscal year ended march  as as previously previously statements of income reported restated reported restated operating revenue direct costs total operating expenses operating income income before provision for taxes and minority interests provision for income taxes net income basic eps diluted eps fiscal quarter ended june september december march unaudited as previously reported gross revenue operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share restated gross revenue operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share as previously reported gross revenue operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share

with the exception of translation adjustments  the impact on these line items is set out in the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet disclosures above 
the translation adjustments were restated from million and million as previously reported for fiscal years and  respectively  to million and million  respectively 
in addition  certain information in notes f  h  k  l and n has been restated to reflect the effect of these adjustments 

table of contents other matters fiscal year and following in december  we were informed that we were not awarded the contract extension commencing in mid to provide search and rescue services using seven s aircraft and operate four helicopter bases for the uk maritime and coastguard agency 
we employ approximately pilots in our north american operations who are represented by the office and professional employees international union opeiu under a collective bargaining agreement 
we and the pilots represented by the opeiu ratified an amended collective bargaining agreement on april  the terms under the amended agreement are fixed until october  and include a wage increase for the pilot group and improvements to several benefit plans that we do not expect to have a material effect on our future operating expenses 
in january  bristow was awarded two contracts to provide helicopter services in the north sea 
the first is a seven year contract that began on july  at the conclusion of the current seven year contract  and is for a total of two large and four medium aircraft 
the second contract is a five year contract that commenced on april  and utilizes two large aircraft 
additionally  bristow was awarded the renewal of a contract in nigeria with an international oil company in january for a minimum of five medium aircraft 
the contract term is for five years beginning on april  in november  we sold certain contracts held by our technical services business to an existing joint venture 
the remaining operations of the technical services business were downsized by ceasing to perform certain services for third parties that had generated poor financial results during the prior two years 
as a result of the downsizing  we reduced staffing levels by an additional positions in the technical services business unit over a nine month period ending on december  approximately million million in severance costs and approximately  in other related costs have been incurred as of march  on july   we purchased a interest in aviashelf  a russian helicopter company that owns five large twin engine helicopters and simultaneously  through two owned companies  purchased two large twin engine helicopters and two fixed wing aircraft  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and we have consolidated the results of the russian helicopter company from the date of acquisition 
the acquisition was financed with million of existing cash and the assumption of million in debt 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon estimated fair values 
no goodwill was recorded 
the pro forma effect on operations of the acquisition when presented  as of the beginning of the periods presented  was not material to our consolidated statements of income 
in may  bristow was awarded a three year extension to the integrated aviation consortium iac contract 
this extension began on july  and will continue the utilization of five large aircraft 
prior to fiscal year as part of the restructuring  in january  we amended our defined benefit pension plan covering certain united kingdom and other overseas employees 
the amendment  which was effective february   essentially removed the defined benefit feature for a participant s future services and replaced it with a defined contribution arrangement 
under the new defined contribution feature  we contribute a maximum of of a participant s non variable salary to a defined contribution section of the plans 
the participant is required to contribute a minimum of of non variable salary for us to match the contribution 
participants were also given the option to transfer out of the plans 
the net impact on our statement of income as a result of these changes was a reduction in pension expense of approximately million million for our fourth quarter of fiscal year in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  the above change to the plans constitutes a curtailment of benefits and  accordingly  all previously deferred service gains or losses are immediately recognized in the statement of income 
at the date of the amendment  we had a deferred prior service gain of million million  or per diluted share  related to prior plan amendments  which was recognized as a curtailment gain in fiscal year 
table of contents in november  our owned mexican affiliate was unsuccessful in renewing a contract for seven aircraft contracted to petr leos mexicanos  or pemex  that expired during calendar year  although in october  that affiliate was awarded a five month contract for five of the seven aircraft mentioned above that concluded on february  four of the seven aircraft continue to be used in mexico for the ad hoc market  and the other three have been redeployed to other markets 
in october  we announced that we had begun a restructuring of our north sea operations 
the restructuring was designed to reduce costs and promote operational and managerial efficiencies to enable us to remain competitive in the north sea offshore helicopter market 
as part of the restructuring program  we reduced staffing levels by approximately positions  or  of our united kingdom workforce over a twelve month period 
we incurred approximately million in severance and other restructuring costs  of which million was incurred in fiscal year and million was expensed in fiscal year in conjunction with our previously announced fleet and facilities renewal and refurbishment program  we changed the residual value estimate of certain aircraft and the useful lives estimate of certain aircraft  effective july  we believe that this new estimate more closely reflects the actual salvage values realized and useful lives experienced by us 
the effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of million million net of tax for fiscal year and million million net of tax for fiscal year this executive overview only includes what management considers to be the most important information and analysis for evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
it provides the context for the discussion and analysis of the financial statements which follows and does not disclose every item bearing on our financial condition and operating performance 
general we operate our business in two segments helicopter services and production management services 
during fiscal year  our helicopter services were conducted through the following four business units north american operations  north sea operations  international operations  and technical services 
we currently conduct our helicopter services through six business units north american operations  south and central american operations  european operations  west african operations  southeast asian operations  and other international operations 
during fiscal year  our north american operations  north sea operations  international operations and technical services contributed approximately   and  respectively  of our total operating revenue 
despite a decrease in flight hours in each of the last three years  our operating revenue has increased over the same time period 
this increase in revenue was the result of the full impact in fiscal year of a rate increase for the us gulf of mexico that was phased in throughout fiscal year and an increase in ad hoc flights for hurricane evacuations during the second quarter of fiscal year we expect that the percentage of our operating revenue derived from our international operations will continue to increase as the major oil and gas companies increasingly focus on prospects outside of north america and the north sea 

table of contents our production management services segment contributed the remaining of our operating revenue in fiscal year operating revenue from this segment in fiscal year increased from fiscal year primarily due to additional work for a major customer 
helicopter services are seasonal in nature  as our flight activities are influenced by the length of daylight hours and weather conditions 
the worst of these conditions typically occurs during the winter months when our ability to safely fly  and our customers ability to safely conduct their operations is inhibited 
accordingly  our flight activity is generally lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 
our operating revenue depends on the demand for our services and the pricing terms of our contracts 
we measure the demand for our helicopter services in flight hours 
demand for our services depends on the level of worldwide offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
we believe that our customers exploration and development activities are influenced by actual and expected trends in commodity prices for oil and gas 
exploration and development activities generally use medium size and larger aircraft on which we typically earn higher margins 
we believe that production related activities are less sensitive to variances in commodity prices  and accordingly  provide more stable activity levels and revenue stream 
we estimate that a majority of our operating revenue from helicopter services is related to the production activities of the oil and gas companies 
our helicopter contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate  or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we estimate that our ad hoc services have a higher margin than our other helicopter contracts due to supply and demand dynamics 
our rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are generally reimbursed by the customer 
our helicopter contracts are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the charter before the end of the contract term 
in our north american operations  we typically enter into short term contracts for months or less  although we occasionally enter into longer term contracts 
in our north sea operations  contracts are longer term  generally between two and five years 
in our international operations  contract length generally ranges from three to five years 
at the expiration of a contract  our customers often negotiate renewal terms with us for the next contract period 
in other instances  customers solicit new bids at the expiration of a contract 
contracts are generally awarded based on a number of factors  including price  quality of service  equipment and record of safety 
an incumbent operator has a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on its relationship with the customer  its knowledge of the site characteristics and its understanding of the cost structure for the operations 
maintenance and repair expenses  training costs  employee wages and insurance premiums represent a significant portion of our overall expenses 
our production management costs also include contracted transportation services 
we expense maintenance and repair costs  including major aircraft component overhaul costs  as the costs are incurred 
in certain instances  major aircraft components  primarily engines and transmissions  are maintained by third party vendors under contractual arrangements 
the maintenance costs related to these contractual arrangements are recorded ratably as the components are used to generate flight revenue 
as a result  our earnings in any given period are directly impacted by the amount of our maintenance and repair expenses for that period 
in addition to our variable operating expenses  we incur fixed charges for depreciation of our property and equipment 
for accounting purposes  we depreciate our helicopters on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  taking into account an estimated residual value of to of their original cost 
we generally estimate the useful life of a helicopter to be seven to years 
our estimates of useful lives and residual values are based upon our historical experience  aircraft type and aircraft condition  as well as our judgment and expectations regarding future operations and market conditions 
we own of the common stock of bristow  and we own of bristow s subordinated debt 
in addition  we have a put call agreement with the other two stockholders of bristow which grants us the right to buy all of their shares of bristow common stock and grants to each of them the right to require us to buy their shares 
the per share price upon the exercise of the put call option by us or the other stockholders of bristow would be equal to its par 
table of contents value plus a factor representing a guaranteed return on investment 
in march  we prepaid a portion of the put call option price representing the amount of guaranteed return since inception  amounting to million 
in consideration of this  the other shareholders of bristow agreed to reduce the guaranteed return factor used in calculating the put call option price  effective april   from per annum to libor plus 
in may  we acquired eight million shares of deferred stock  essentially a subordinated class of stock with no voting rights  from bristow for per share million in total 
bristow used these proceeds to redeem million million of its ordinary share capital at par value on a pro rata basis from all of its outstanding shareholders  including ourselves 
the result of these changes will be to reduce the cost of the guaranteed return to the other shareholders  which we record as minority interest expense  by approximately million on an annual basis 
consequently  beginning in september  we began paying the amount of guaranteed return on the put call on a quarterly basis 
in fiscal year  the amount paid was   representing the amount due from may  to december  subsequent to march   we paid   representing the amount due from january  to june  these payments were charged against minority interest on our balance sheet where this obligation had been accrued and included in minority interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
under uk regulations  to maintain bristow s operating license  we would be required to find a qualified european union owner to acquire any of the bristow shares that we have the right or obligation to acquire under the agreement 
the only restriction under the put call agreement limiting our ability to exercise the put call option is a requirement to consult with the caa regarding the suitability of the new holder of the bristow shares 
the put call agreement does not contain any provisions should the caa not approve the new holder of the bristow shares 
however  we would work diligently to find a european union owner suitable to the caa 
as a result of our ownership and contractual arrangements  we consolidate the results of bristow and its subsidiaries 
for additional information about bristow  see note a and note j in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
as a result of local laws limiting foreign ownership of aviation companies  we conduct helicopter services in many foreign countries through interests in unconsolidated affiliates 
generally  we realize revenue from these foreign operations by leasing aircraft and providing services and technical support to those entities 
we also receive dividend income from the earnings of some of these entities 
we report lease revenue as operating revenue and dividend income as part of earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  as the results of these foreign operations are not included in our revenue or operating income 
for additional information about these unconsolidated affiliates  see note c in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating information for our two segments  helicopter services and production management services  and for the four business units comprising our helicopter services segment 
the table also presents certain operating information about our corporate activities which primarily relate to intercompany leasing of aircraft and are eliminated in consolidation

operating revenue increased despite a decrease in flight hours as a result of the full impact in the current fiscal year of a rate increase for the us gulf of mexico that was phased in throughout fiscal year  and an increase in ad hoc flights for hurricane evacuations during the second quarter of fiscal year operating expense from our north american operations increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in operating expense was primarily in salary costs and additional depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for fiscal year was million  or higher than for fiscal year  primarily due to additional aircraft added to the fleet during the past two fiscal years 
the increase in depreciation expense was offset in part by a million decrease resulting from a change in salvage value and useful lives on certain aircraft types 
as a result of higher operating expense  our operating margin in our north american operations decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year north sea operations 
operating revenue from north sea operations increased for fiscal year to million  or  from million for fiscal year included in fiscal year operating revenue is million attributable to foreign exchange effects 
excluding the foreign exchange effects  revenue from north sea operations decreased in fiscal year primarily due to lower flight activity during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year flight hours decreased by between the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year 
the reduction in flight hours is due primarily to a change in our lease arrangements in norway 
while we continue to lease aircraft to our unconsolidated affiliate  norsk helikopter as  we no longer provide maintenance services for these aircraft 
therefore  we no longer report the flight hours 
excluding the flight hours for norway  flight activity decreased by from fiscal year to fiscal year operating expenses from north sea operations increased million in fiscal year included in the operating expense for the north sea operation is million attributable to foreign exchange effects 
excluding the foreign exchange effects  operating expense decreased in fiscal year this decrease was primarily in salary costs due to the restructuring of the north sea operations and the amendment of the pension plan

nigeria accounted for approximately of operating revenue from international operations in fiscal year as a result of the potential cancellation by customers of their contracts with us  we may experience a substantial reduction in business activity in nigeria in future periods 
in brazil  flight activity decreased and operating revenue decreased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year flight activity decreased significantly more than operating revenue primarily as a result of a change in the mix of aircraft operating in brazil 
while the decrease in flight activity negatively affected operating revenue  the addition of a large aircraft at higher rates largely offset the decrease 
brazil accounted for approximately of operating revenue from international operations in fiscal year we are negotiating the termination of our ownership interest in the joint venture that operates in brazil  and upon such termination  absent our development of a satisfactory relationship with another local operating company  we expect to experience a substantial reduction in business activity in brazil in future periods

professional fees in the current fiscal year included fees incurred in connection with the investigation by outside counsel of activities related to the internal review  an executive search  sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and other projects requiring consulting services 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased in fiscal year by million primarily due to a decrease in dividends received from investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting

other income expense other expense  net  in fiscal year was million compared to other expense  net  of million in fiscal year and primarily represents foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
these gains and losses arise from the consolidation of bristow  whose functional currency is the british pound sterling  yet contracts for a portion of its revenue and expense in us dollars and other currencies for operations outside of the north sea 
the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound is the primary reason for the losses 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results during fiscal year  our operating revenue increased to million  or  from million in fiscal year the increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of increased oil and gas activity in our international operations and rate increases on customer contracts in our north american operations

north american operations 
operating revenue from our north american operations increased in fiscal year to million  or  from the prior fiscal year while flight activity remained constant 
the increase in operating revenue with static flight activity is due primarily to the rate increase in the us gulf of mexico that went into effect march and was phased in throughout fiscal year operating expenses from our north american operations decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to lower maintenance and insurance costs

the operating margin in our north sea operations decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to the reduction in revenue 
international operations 
operating revenue from international operations increased in fiscal year to million  or  from million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of a increase in flight activity from the prior fiscal year 
in brazil  flight activity and operating revenue for fiscal year increased by and  respectively  from fiscal year the increase in flight activity and operating revenue was primarily due to three additional aircraft sent to the area during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in response to increased drilling activity 
in mexico  flight activity and operating revenue for fiscal year increased over the prior fiscal year levels by and  respectively 
the increase in flight activity and operating revenue were primarily due to the addition of two aircraft in the second quarter of fiscal year operating revenue was positively impacted by the addition of the two aircraft and a favorable change in the mix of aircraft 
however  during july  six older aircraft which we directly leased into mexico were replaced with six newer aircraft owned by an unconsolidated affiliate 
accordingly  the revenue from these aircraft is no longer consolidated in our results 
instead  we record our equity in the net results of the unconsolidated affiliate in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  which for fiscal year was million 
in nigeria  customer flight hours and operating revenue increased for fiscal year by and  respectively over fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of a controlling interest in a west african operating company in july  when we began to provide services to a major oil company under a five year contract 
this increase was partially offset by the decrease in flight activity with one customer that furnishes its own aircraft not reflected in hours 
operating margins were virtually unchanged

the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in dividends from our unconsolidated affiliate in egypt partially offset by higher earnings from equity method investees 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased in fiscal year by million primarily due to the debt refinancing transaction that took place in june and july see note b in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this interest was offset by million of interest capitalized in fiscal year related to progress payments for our fleet and facilities renewal and refurbishment program and million of interest income from the investment of the proceeds of the debt refinancing for approximately one month 
loss on extinguishment of debt a loss on extinguishment of debt of million was recognized in fiscal year related to the redemption on july  of our convertible subordinated notes and our senior notes

other income expense other expense  net  for fiscal year was million compared to other expense  net  of million in fiscal year and primarily represents foreign currency transaction losses 
these losses arise from the consolidation of our united kingdom operations  whose functional currency is the british pound sterling  yet contracts for a portion of its revenue and expense in us dollars and other currencies for operations outside of the north sea 
the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound since march  is the primary reason for these losses 
income taxes our effective income tax rates from continuing operations were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the variance between the us federal statutory rate and the effective rate for these periods is due primarily to the permanent reinvestment outside the us of foreign earnings  upon which no us tax has been provided 
our effective tax rate is also impacted by the amount of our foreign source income and our ability to realize foreign tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year  our primary source of funds to meet working capital needs  service debt and fund capital expenditures was cash from operations 
we believe that our future cash flow from operations  our existing us revolving credit facility and alternative financing sources will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs in the foreseeable future 
we will likely need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to finance existing commitments under our fleet renewal program and to execute our growth strategy 
see risk factors in order to grow our business  we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us 
operating activities cash and cash equivalents were million  million and million as of march   and  respectively

the following table shows capital expenditures for fiscal years  and in thousands capital expenditures aircraft and related equipment other total capital expenditures fiscal year during fiscal year  we received proceeds of million primarily from the disposal of ten aircraft and certain equipment  which resulted in a net gain of million 
we also received proceeds of million from the sale of seven aircraft and certain contracts in our technical services business unit to a owned unconsolidated affiliate which resulted in a gain of million 
see note j in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in fiscal year  we initiated a fleet renewal program 
under the program  we expect to incur additional capital expenditures over the next five to seven fiscal years to replace certain of our aircraft and upgrade strategic base facilities 
as of march   we have expended million as deposits and progress payments toward firm purchase commitments of million under the fleet renewal program 
subsequent to march   we made additional payments under this program of million and incurred additional firm purchase commitments of million 
to the extent they occur  any sales and trade ins of older aircraft will reduce these projected expenditures 
we plan to use internally generated funds and alternative financing sources  if needed  to meet our obligations under the program 
apart from commitments under our fleet renewal program  we purchased one large aircraft for million 
additionally  subsequent to march   we purchased five small aircraft for million and paid deposits of million for five large aircraft and four medium aircraft

the total purchase price of the five aircraft was million 
we funded million of the purchase price from available cash and the balance of million was financed by the manufacturer for days with interest payable at month libor plus 
in addition  we purchased a sixth medium aircraft for million 
these aircraft were purchased to meet the contract renewal requirements of an existing customer of our unconsolidated affiliate in mexico  and replaced older aircraft currently being used on the contract 
on july   we sold these six aircraft  at our cost  to a newly formed limited liability company  rotorwing leasing resources  llc or rlr 
the capital of rlr is owned by us and by the same principal with whom we have other jointly owned businesses operating in mexico 
rlr financed of the purchase price of these aircraft through a five year term loan of million with a bank requiring monthly principal and interest payments of  and a balloon payment of million due july  the rlr note 
the rlr note is secured by the six aircraft 
we guaranteed of the rlr note million and the other shareholder guaranteed the remaining of the rlr note million 
in addition  we have given the bank a put option which the bank may exercise if the aircraft are not returned to the united states within days of a default on the rlr note 
any such exercise would require us to purchase the rlr note from the bank 
we simultaneously entered into a similar agreement with the other rlr shareholder which requires that  in event of exercise by the bank of its put option to us  the other shareholder will be required to purchase of the rlr note from us 
as of march   a liability of million representing the fair value of this guarantee was reflected in our balance sheet in other liabilities and deferred credits 
the fair value of the guarantee being amortized over the term of the rlr note 
as of june   we were in default of various financial information reporting covenants under the rlr note for not providing financial information for fiscal year when due  and also for not providing similar information to other creditors 
this situation resulted from the activities identified in the internal review discussed earlier which prevented us from filing our financial report for fiscal year on time 
the bank initially provided a waiver through august   and subsequently provided a second waiver through november  further  we extended the waiver at our election through december  upon payment of a fee  and we have elected to exercise our option to further extend these waivers through january  upon payment of an additional fee

as of june   however  we were in default of various financial information reporting covenants for not providing financial information for fiscal year when due  and also for not providing similar information to other creditors 
this situation resulted from the activities identified in the internal review discussed earlier which prevented us from filing our financial report for fiscal year on time 
the bank initially provided a waiver through august   and subsequently provided a second waiver through november  waivers were extended through december  upon payment of a fee  and we have elected to exercise our option to further extend these waivers though january  upon payment of an additional fee

uk taxes 
during january  we reached a settlement with the united kingdom inland revenue regarding the tax treatment for certain aircraft maintenance expenditures by our primary united kingdom operating company 
these expenditures are contractual cash payments made to certain repair and maintenance service providers in advance of the actual repair requirement 
we have historically deducted these expenditures for tax purposes as the payments were made  but will now treat these expenditures as prepayments for united kingdom income tax purposes to be deducted when the repair or maintenance service actually occurs 
this change in treatment was made effective april   and resulted in a cash payment for taxes and interest of million million in fiscal year  with a further payment during the first quarter of fiscal year of million million 
the payment of these taxes will not affect total tax expense on our income statement but will instead be treated as a deferred tax asset to be deducted in the future when the repair and maintenance services are provided 
pension plan 
as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability and a million prepaid pension asset related to the bristow pension plan 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the asset represents the cumulative contributions made by bristow in excess of accrued net periodic pension cost 
in addition to the recognition of the minimum pension liability  the united kingdom rules governing pension plan funding require us to make additional cash contributions to the plan 
in february  we agreed to a schedule of contributions for our defined benefit pension plan in order to comply with the minimum funding rules of the united kingdom 
those rules require us to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as defined by united kingdom legislation within three years and funded within ten years 
in recognition of participants concerns regarding the under funded position of the plan as well as other changes we made to the plan as more fully described under executive overview other matters prior to fiscal year  on february   we contributed million million to the plan to reach the funded level  and agreed to monthly contributions of million million for the next ten years to comply with the funding requirement 
the million million contribution was made from existing cash balances and did 
table of contents not materially impact our working capital position 
in march  we agreed  subject to our review every three years  to increase the monthly contributions to million million for the next years beginning may nevertheless  regulatory agencies in the united kingdom may require us to increase the monthly contributions further 
minority interest 
in march  we prepaid million  representing a portion of the put call option price over the of the ordinary share capital of bristow that we do not own 
this payment was made from existing cash balances 
beginning in september  we began to pay the amount of guaranteed return on the put call on a quarterly basis 
in fiscal year  the amount paid was   representing the amount due from may  to december  subsequent to march   we paid   representing the amount due from january  to june  in may  we acquired eight million shares of deferred stock essentially a subordinated class of stock with no voting rights from bristow for per share million in total 
bristow used the proceeds to redeem million of its ordinary share capital at par value from all of its outstanding shareholders  including ourselves 
the result of these changes will be to reduce the cost of the guaranteed return to the other shareholders  which we record as minority interest expense  by million on an annual basis 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we have the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases pension obligations unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period less than over total year years years years in thousands other commercial commitments debt guarantee letters of credit and surety bond total commercial commitments we have guaranteed the repayment of up to million million of the debt of fbs and million of the debt of rlr  both unconsolidated affiliates 
since march   we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations of million for additional aircraft not reflected in the table above 
currency fluctuations through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are in british pounds sterling 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are 
table of contents provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries 
generally  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our operating revenue 
because we maintain our financial statements in us dollars  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the us dollar and between other foreign currencies and the us dollar 
in preparing our financial statements  we must convert all non us dollar currencies to non us dollars 
the effect of foreign currency translation is reflected in a component of stockholders investment and foreign currency transaction gains or losses are credited or charged to income and reflected in other income expense 
in the past three fiscal years our stockholders investment has increased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
the british pound sterling is the currency in which most of bristow s revenue and expenses are paid 
approximately of our operating revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pounds sterling into us dollars 
in addition  we receive other revenue that is not in us dollars or british pounds sterling  such as australian dollars  euros  nigerian naira  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
we can reduce or eliminate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we also have expenses that are payable in the same foreign currency as our revenue 
our principal exposure is to changes in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
during fiscal year  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us  with an average of one british pound us for the fiscal year 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us 
during fiscal year  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us for the fiscal year  with an average of one british pound us 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
income taxes 
our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore oilfield service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market condition in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax 
table of contents credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
our annual tax provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 
judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  primarily us foreign tax credit carry forwards was million 
we decreased the valuation allowance as of march  to million  and decreased it to million as of march  if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
the american jobs creation act of the act  enacted in october  included a provision creating a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate foreign earnings by providing an deduction for certain dividends paid by controlled foreign corporations of us corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements  one of which is to adopt a domestic reinvestment plan drip to document planned reinvestments of amounts equal to the foreign earnings repatriated under the act 
see note f in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
property and equipment 
our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 

table of contents our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment evaluation is made by asset group 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
revenue recognition 
in general  we recognize revenue when it is both realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when the following conditions exist the persuasive evidence of an arrangement  generally a customer contract  the services or products have been performed or delivered to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable within the contract  and collection is probable 
more specifically  revenue from helicopter services is recognized based on contractual rates as the related services are performed 
the charges under these contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
these contracts are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the contract before the end of the term 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we estimate that our ad hoc services have a higher margin than our other helicopter contracts due to supply and demand dynamics 
in order to offset potential increases in operating costs  our long term contracts may provide for periodic increases in the contractual rates charged for our services 
we recognize the impact of these rate 
table of contents increases when the criteria outlined above have been met 
this generally includes written recognition from our customers that they are in agreement with the amount of the rate escalation 
in addition  our standard rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are generally reimbursed by the customer 
revenue from production management is recognized based on contractual rates as the related services are performed 
contracts are generally evergreen with a yearly review 
each party has a thirty day cancellation clause 
the rates charged to the customer are either monthly  based on services specified in the contract  or hourly if outside the scope of the contract 
typically hourly rates are charged for services provided beyond the basic level contemplated in the contract 
services provided include personnel and transportation 
any escalation in rates is agreed to in writing by the customer 
with respect to both our helicopter services and production management  cost reimbursements from customers are recorded as revenue 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit retiree life insurance and medical benefits obligations and the related benefit costs are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
pension and postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these reserves  we consider our historical experience  changes in our customer s financial position  restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with customers regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
during fiscal years  and  we established new reserves for doubtful accounts of million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  in each of the three fiscal years ended march   and we wrote off uncollectible accounts of million  million and million  respectively  all of which had been previously reserved 
inventory reserve 
we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
insurance 
we are self insured for our group medical insurance plans in the us in addition  we have several medical plans covering certain us employee groups 
we must make estimates to record the expenses related to these plans 
we also have workers compensation programs in the us for work related injuries 
in addition  we have insurance for work related injuries covering certain non us employee groups 
we estimate the expenses related to the retained portion of that risk 
if actual experience under any of our insurance plans is greater than our 
table of contents original estimates  we may have to record charges to income when we identify the risk of additional loss 
conversely  if actual costs are lower than our estimates or return premiums are larger than originally projected  we may have to record credits to income 
contingent liabilities 
we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation  personal injury claims and potential tax assessments 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known 
goodwill impairment 
we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march as prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples 
estimated discounted cash flows are based on projected flight hours and rates 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the annual review  we also test for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to eliminate the similar productive assets concept and replace it with the concept of commercial substance 
commercial substance occurs when the future cash flows of an entity are changed significantly due to the nonmonetary exchange 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r becomes effective for our fiscal year beginning april  and will require companies to expense stock options and other share based payments 
we do not currently know whether implementation of sfas no 
r would result in financial results materially different from pro forma results presented in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp which provides accounting guidance to companies that will be eligible for the tax deduction resulting from qualified production activities income as defined in the american jobs creation act of the act 
fsp no 
provides that this deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas rather than a reduction in the statutory tax rate applied to deferred tax items 
as such  fsp does not result in a revaluation of our us deferred tax assets 
the impact of this deduction  if it applies  will first be reported in fiscal year  the first tax year commencing after december  we are in the process of reviewing whether any of our operations qualify for this deduction 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp no 
to address the treatment of a special one time incentive provided in the act for companies to repatriate foreign earnings 
signed into law on october   the act provides for a special one time tax deduction equal to 
table of contents of dividends received out of qualifying foreign earnings that are paid in either a company s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date 
the special deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements  one of which is to adopt a domestic reinvestment plan drip to document planned reinvestments of amounts equal to the foreign earnings repatriated under the act 
fsp provides entities additional time to assess the effect of repatriating foreign earnings under the act for purposes of applying sfas no 
 which otherwise requires the effect of a new tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment 
as of march   the company had not made a decision on whether  and to what extent  to repatriate previously unremitted foreign earnings 
however  in september  senior management approved a drip that provides for the repatriation of up to million of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the act 
if the company does repatriate the maximum amount called for in the drip  the related us tax liability associated with the total repatriated earnings would be approximately million 
technical corrections  regulations and additional guidance from the us treasury related to the statute could impact our estimate of the tax liability associated with the potential range of repatriation 
the favorable us tax rate on such repatriations under the act applies to qualifying distributions received by the company through march  as of october  the company had received million of repatriated funds intended to qualify under the act 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the interpretation is effective for our fiscal year ending march  interpretation no 
provides clarification on conditional asset retirement obligations and the fair value of such obligations as referred to in sfas no 
we do not expect the adoption of interpretation no 
to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
becomes effective for our fiscal year beginning april  and provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
establishes the method of retrospective application as the required method of reporting a change in accounting principle  unless impracticable  or unless the new accounting principle explicitly states transition requirements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial statements  and the adoption of this standard would not have affected the restatements reflected in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of march   we have million of debt outstanding  none of which carries a variable rate of interest 
however  the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
we occasionally use off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage our risks associated with our operating activities conducted in foreign currencies 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  we will use forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
we have historically used these instruments primarily in the buying and selling of certain spare parts  maintenance services and equipment 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenue and expenses in the same currency for our contracts 
most of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are denominated in british pound sterling 
approximately of our operating revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pounds sterling into us dollars 
as of march   we did not have any nominal forward exchange contracts outstanding 
subsequent to march   we have not entered into any nominal forward exchange contracts
