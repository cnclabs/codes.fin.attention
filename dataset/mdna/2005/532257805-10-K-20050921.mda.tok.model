we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward looking statements contained in this report 
liquidity and capital resources history from february when our ipo occurred to fiscal  inclusive  we raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stocks  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants on our capital stock 
we did not have any equity or debt financing transactions in fiscal  however in fiscal and we raised approximately million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock 
our optical product markets experienced a severe downturn beginning fiscal  which continued into fiscal and resulted in a significant decline in the demand for our products over that period 
beginning in and continuing in fiscal  we believe that some improvement occurred in demand for our products in several of our markets 
nevertheless  we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during this fiscal year 
we have developed our operating plan for fiscal and believe we have has adequate financial resources for achievement of that plan 
nevertheless  we will be managing against that plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met during the year  remedial actions will be initiated 
such necessary actions  in addition to cost controls and vigorous sales activities  may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the company or of some of our product capabilities 
it is also possible that we may be required to seek additional external financing in fiscal  which may not be available on reasonable terms and could be highly dilutive to current shareholders 
we have no firm commitments for any material future financing at this time and we have a cash balance of approximately million at june  we may still seek external debt or equity financing if it can be obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable to us 
cash flows cash used by operations during fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from fiscal throughout fiscal  on a comparative basis to fiscal  we reduced our cash expenditures through the reductions in insurance  professional services  and telecommunication costs 
cash use was also favorably affected in fiscal by an increase in gross margin resulting from the growth in year to year revenues 
while progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow in fiscal and  significant risk and uncertainty remains 
our cash provided by operations was less than  for the fourth quarter of fiscal the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections which we have developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
factors which could adversely affect cash balances in future quarters include  but are not limited to  a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sales growth  increased material costs  increased labor costs  planned production efficiency improvements not being realized  increases in property  casualty  benefit and liability insurance premiums and increases in other discretionary spending  particularly sales and marketing related 
in the event that we find it necessary to raise additional funds to sustain operations and we are unable to do so  we may need to take such actions as additional restructuring of operations to reduce costs 
should that occur  the realizability of certain assets  especially inventory  property and equipment  intellectual property and other intangible assets may be such that significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements would be required 
during fiscal  we expended approximately  for capital equipment in comparison to  during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity 
our operating plan for fiscal estimates expenditures at similar levels to enhance or expand our capacity  however  we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances 
key performance indicators how we operate we have continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business with characteristics of the semiconductor industry 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
that is followed by sampling them small numbers of the product for their test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we have several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff 
the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality 
our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit all of their source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
we believe that our non financial production indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level business cycle sales backlog inventory levels accounts receivable levels and quality these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog going forward  sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our disclosure backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher backlog is better for the company 
disclosure backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate disclosure backlog q q q q q q we believe the downward trend in the disclosure backlog was principally caused by a fall off in telecommunications orders in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year we believe the trend will be reversed as sales to customers in our other markets continue to grow 
inventory levels we manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average accounts receivable levels and quality similarly  we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dso for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average the table below presents certain of our significant contractual obligations as of june  the operating leases relate to real estate and are commitments that are expensed as paid per the terms of the related contracts 
contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in s less than year years years after years comments operating leases  real estate leases with monthly payments capital leases production equipment lease outstanding purchase obligations current purchase orders outstanding year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated operations our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the increase was attributable to increases in all of our product categories with aspheric lenses and isolator products accounting for over of the increase 
while both represented increased total demand  the aspheric lens increases were from across several of the industries that we serve with that product line while the isolator increases were from a few customers  mostly in communications markets  specifically data communications 
our operating plan for fiscal projects continued revenue gains in aspheric lenses and collimators but anticipates a decline in isolator sales caused by decreased demand and price competition 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  which is an increase over fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this increase was caused by several factors 
among them  a one time charge in rework and scrap in aspheric lenses  early stage production costs related to the introduction of new products and competitive pricing pressure in our isolator line 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and higher yields from statistical process control applications 
our operating plan projects higher gross margin levels in fiscal than we achieved in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a  reduction in compensation related expenses and  reduction in depreciation expense 
other improvements were realized from cost savings such as a  decrease in insurance related expense   decrease in rent  repairs and maintenance  and telephone expenses   decrease in franchise and sales tax  and a  reduction in legal expenses in compared to our operating plan for fiscal projects business levels that will require selling  general and administrative expenses to increase  primarily caused by selective hiring of additional employees and expected cost increases in certain items such as payroll and benefit related costs and commissions due to increased sales volume 
new product development costs were consistent with fiscal at approximately million in fiscal this modest decrease was primarily due to reduced outside services and small tooling costs  partially offset by an increase in compensation related expenses 
our operating plan for fiscal projects some increases in new product development spending in order to support increased quote and customer design activity as well as continued investment in new product projects 
in fiscal our amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately million to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal the most significant component of our identified intangibles subject to amortization relates to the developed technology molded aspheric lenses from our acquisition of geltech in fiscal that asset was determined to have a four year life at the time of the acquisition  which was accounted for by the purchase method 
that amortization ended after the first quarter of fiscal other income and expenses decreased by approximately million to less than million of expenses from approximately million of income in fiscal the most significant reason for the reduction is the one time legal settlement that occurred in fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with million in fiscal  an improvement of approximately million 
this million improvement in the current year was comprised principally of gross margin improvement of million insurance expense reduction of million depreciation and amortization reduction of million year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated operations our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in our aspheric lens and isolator products 
while both represented increased total demand  the aspheric lens increases were from across several of the industries that we serve with that product line while the isolator increases were from just a few customers  mostly in communications markets  specifically data communications 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  which was a notable improvement over fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this improvement was caused by several factors 
primary among them was having the benefit of the fiscal consolidation in our manufacturing sites to enable us to operate without the overhead of severely underutilized facilities 
additionally  substantial work was accomplished to reduce materials costs and to rationalize the production lines when they were re assembled in orlando 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by over million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower headcount in these departments for parts of the year  some driven by the site consolidations and some by job consolidations in orlando 
other improvements were realized from cost savings such as the reduction in our d o insurance premium in over new product development costs were reduced by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal similar to sg a costs  this decrease was primarily due to lower headcount in this department for part of the year driven by the site consolidations that occurred in late in fiscal we increased headcount in new product development to support certain new product projects and to support customer requests for new or modified product designs as part of our sales and marketing process 
in fiscal our amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately million to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal the most significant component of our identified intangibles subject to amortization relates to the developed technology molded aspheric lenses from our acquisition of geltech in fiscal other income and expense for fiscal contained several items that are generally not expected to be recurring 
we offered excess production equipment for sale throughout the fiscal year that was salvaged from our site consolidations in fiscal and we realized a gain of approximately  during fiscal year on proceeds of  also  we settled litigation in the third quarter of fiscal for gross proceeds of  to us  which was offset by legal costs of  for a net gain of approximately  our investment income in fiscal reached only  compared with over  in fiscal when available interest rates and our investable balances were higher 
the primary remaining balance in other income and expense is the amortization of the fair value of a warrant issued to a related party in early fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with million in fiscal  an improvement of approximately million 
this million improvement in the current year was comprised approximately of a gross margin improvement of million  improved departmental operating costs of million  reduced amortization of intangibles of million  a lack of asset impairments compared with the prior year of million  a reduction in reorganization and relocation expenses of million  and a prior year change in accounting principle of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to select appropriate company accounting policies  and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which the company s financial statements depend 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting principles identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii inventory valuation  iii long lived assets  and iv intangible assets 
these critical accounting policies and our other significant accounting policies are further disclosed in note to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of the product provided that persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists  title has transferred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
inventory valuation 
we regularly assess the valuation of inventories and write down those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to estimated net realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon the our analyses and assumptions  including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecast or actual demand from customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  we may be able to use or sell inventories that have previously been written down 
long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
if facts and circumstances warrant such a review  a long lived asset would be impaired if future undiscounted cash flows  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
once deemed impaired  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is  by its nature  a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
intangible assets 
we generally obtain intangible assets in connection with a business unit purchase for example  in a business combination 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the use of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus subject to significant judgment 
because individual intangible assets may be i expensed immediately upon acquisition for example  purchased in process research and development assets  or ii amortized over their estimated useful life for example  acquired technology  their assigned values could have a material affect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangible assets are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for impairment as other long lived assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as expenses regardless of whether they meet the criterion of abnormal 
the statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead factors to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  and are to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this statement is effective for the fiscal years beginning after june  this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the exchange of nonmonetary assets 
the statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets issued in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance  that is  transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
apb opinion no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  fasb issued an emerging issues task force eitf consensus in issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  and an amendment to issue no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholders have certain approval or veto rights 
the eitf consensus is limited to limited partnerships or similar entities that are not variable interest entities under fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the consensus states that the general partners in a limited partnership should determine whether they control a limited partnership based on certain criteria 
the consensus provides a framework that makes it more difficult for a general partner to overcome the presumption that it controls the limited partnership  therefore making it more likely that the general partner would be required to consolidate the limited partnership 
for existing limited partnership agreements that have not been modified  the guidance should be applied in financial statements issued for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  for all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified  the guidance is effective after june  the adoption of this consensus is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest a portion of our cash reserves in a money market fund  which invests at least of its net assets in securities issued by the us treasury and in related repurchase agreements 
the money market fund is not protected under the fdic  however  we have not experienced any losses in these funds 
we do not believe that changes in market interest rates of up to percent either up or down will have any material effect on our results of operations
