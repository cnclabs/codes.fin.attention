overview the business of bioanalytical systems  inc is very much dependent on the level of pharmaceutical and biotech companies efforts in new drug discovery and approval 
our services segment is the direct beneficiary of these efforts  through outsourcing by these companies of research work  and our products segment is the indirect beneficiary  as increased drug development leads to capital expansion providing opportunities to sell the equipment we produce and the consumable supplies we provide that support our products 
developments within the industries we serve have a direct  and sometimes material  impact on our operations 
one significant development in the past decade has been the continuing consolidation among large pharmaceutical corporations 
we believe that  on the whole  this consolidation should have a positive impact on our business  as these increasingly larger pharmaceutical companies will devote their internal resources  our main competitor  to only those drug candidates with the potential to have a material impact on their operations  and will outsource more of their lesser opportunities 
additionally  many drug candidates will not meet the financial hurdles established by the major pharmaceutical companies  and will be developed by smaller  specialty pharmaceutical companies that do not possess internal capabilities to test and analyze the drug candidate  or have the capability to scientifically monitor the product once approved 
offsetting those potential positive impacts  the major pharmaceutical companies tend to reevaluate their development programs after major acquisitions  which sometimes cause them to defer  or cancel  work that we were scheduled to perform 
we are also at risk that a significant client for us may be acquired by a corporation that prefers to perform the work internally  or has a long standing relationship with one of our competitors 
we anticipate that as companies in our markets consolidate  our competitors will also consolidate  which will result in fewer  but much stronger  competitors for our business 
two very significant demographic developments are impacting pharmaceutical companies  and therefore  our markets 
the first is the well documented aging of western populations  with the incident increase of diseases associated with aging and the increasing periods of treatment 
the other is the so called genomic era  where the knowledge of the genome  including human and other organisms  is spawning the technologies and investment to develop additional therapies 
we believe that both will positively impact our markets by increasing the amount of drug development and monitoring activity 
research services are capital intensive 
the investment in equipment and facilities to serve our markets is substantial and continuing 
while our physical facilities are excellent to meet market needs for the near term  rapid changes in automation  precision  speed and technologies necessitate a constant investment in equipment and software to meet market demands 
we are also impacted by the heightened regulatory environment and the need to improve our business infrastructure to support our increasingly diverse operations  which will necessitate additional capital investment 
our ability to generate capital to reinvest in our capabilities  both through operations and financial transactions  is critical to our success 
while we are currently committed to fully utilizing recent additions to our capacity  sustained growth will require additional investment in future periods 
one of the more important factors in our profitability is the utilization of our capacity 
in the past two years  we have added significant new capacity through acquisitions in baltimore  maryland and mcminnville  oregon  and through facility expansions in west lafayette and evansville  indiana 
these expansions created a higher level of basic operating expenses 
those related to productive capacity are included in cost of services 
as a result  after expansion  while we are developing the sales to fill these facilities  our percentage margins on services have declined because many of these costs are the same as they will be at full capacity  but are being spread over less than capacity revenues 
while the capacity and capabilities added have the potential to positively impact future operating results  their costs have had a negative impact in the current year

a percentage of service and product revenues  respectively 
year ended september   compared with year ended september  total revenue for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  service revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the inclusion of two acquired businesses for the entire year in the current fiscal year  compared to inclusion from the date of acquisition in the prior year  caused a increase in year to year revenues 
the other of revenue growth came from increased sales at all operating locations  except west lafayette research services  which had a decline 
these increases were the result of increased sales efforts in the baltimore and evansville locations  and improvement in our facilities from recent capital expenditures 
product revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to sales of the culex automated blood sampling system 
the increase in culex sales is a result of continuing acceptance of the technology by new customers  as well as strong re orders by existing customers 
inflation in prices did not have a material impact on sales increases 
costs of revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase of million was due to the inclusion of the acquired businesses mentioned in the revenue discussion and the costs of additional revenues 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues for services increased due to the lower utilization of capacity of the acquired businesses costs of idle capacity are charged to cost of service revenue 
costs of revenue for the company s products segment decreased to as a percentage of product revenue for the year ended september  from of product revenue for the year ended september   as a result of product sales growth being driven by culex sales  which command higher margins than the company s older product lines 
selling expenses for the year ended september  decreased by to million from million during the year ended september   due to decreased headcount in sales 
research and development expenses  which are net of grant reimbursements  for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease of  is primarily due to reducing the number of research projects in the current year 
general and administrative expenses  for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september   as a result of the acquired business mentioned above 
the company also incurred  of non recurring consulting expenses necessitated by turnover in the company s finance department for the first six months of fiscal the company utilized a contract chief accounting officer and additional financial consultants to compensate for the resignation of both the chief financial officer and chief accounting officer 
other income expense  net  was  in the year ended september  as compared to  in the year ended september   as a result of the increase in interest expense from  to  due to increased borrowings for the acquisitions and additional construction of facilities  and a non recurring gain from sale of an excess facility of  in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was a benefit of for as a result of having a us taxable loss that can be carried back for refunds against prior years taxes  coupled with profitable operations in the united kingdom  where the company is utilizing loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the company has tax net operating loss carryforwards for its subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
such carryforwards  which have an indefinite life  are available to offset taxable income generated by those subsidiaries as provided by united kingdom tax regulations 
the prior year s tax rate was the result of taxable us income with a foreign loss generating no offsetting benefit 
as a result of the above  the company lost per share in fiscal  both basic and diluted  compared to net income in fiscal of per share  both basic and diluted 
year ended september   compared with year ended september  revenue for the fiscal year ended september  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended september  net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal service revenue increases over the prior year were primarily the result of the company s acquisitions and bioanalytical services growth 
product sales declined for the year due to weak capital spending among pharmaceutical developers but saw significant gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of revenue for the year ended september  was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended september  the integration of the basi clinical research unit  the former pharmakinetics laboratories  inc  pklb acquired in june and basi northwest laboratories the former lc resources  inc lcr acquired in december into the company adversely impacted the company s earnings in fiscal additionally  underutilization of recently added preclinical services capacity  due primarily to the pfizer pharmacia merger  had significant negative effects on the company s results of operations in fiscal research and development expenses  which are net of grant reimbursements  for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in research staff  most of who were not committed to in vivo products and services 
general and administrative expenses  for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september   primarily as a result of the acquisitions and the addition of strategic management positions 
other income expense  net  was  in the year ended september  as compared to  in the year ended september  this increase was attributable to the addition of new debt in late october resulting in increased interest expense  which was partially offset by gains on the sale of property and equipment in the company s effective tax rate for was  compared to for fiscal the foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards result in a reduced consolidated effective tax rate in periods where taxable income is generated by these foreign subsidiaries  as in in fiscal  these foreign operations generated an after tax loss 
these losses are not tax deductible  which  when consolidated with the company s domestic operations  resulted in lower consolidated net taxable income and a higher overall effective tax rate 
as a result of the above  the company earned per share  both basic and diluted  compared to earnings of per share in the prior year  both basic and diluted 
liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis since its inception  the company s principal sources of cash have been cash flow generated from operations and funds received from bank borrowings and other financings 
at september   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at september  the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended september  cash provided by operations during the year ended september  consisted of net loss of  net non cash charges of million and net cash used of million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the most significant items affecting the change in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in refundable income taxes of million  offset by an increase in customer advances of million 
the increases in accounts receivable and customer advances are the result of higher service revenue activity at the end of fiscal over the increase in refundable income taxes is a result of the current year s loss 
cash used by investing activities decreased to million for the year ended september  from million and million for the years ended september  and respectively  primarily due to the completion of construction projects in evansville and west lafayette in fiscal  and no expenditures in fiscal for acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  was million  compared to million and million respectively for fiscal and this decrease was primarily due to completion of the construction and acquisition activity of the prior two fiscal years  reducing the need for new financing 
the company announced in december  that it had reached a definitive agreement to sell and lease back its facility in baltimore  maryland

this transaction was completed on january  after transaction expenses  the company generated approximately million in cash from this transaction  which was used to reduce outstanding debt and increase working capital 
capital resources total expenditures by the company for property and equipment were million funded by revolving line of credit and the construction line of credit  million funded by long term debt and the construction line of credit and million funded by revolving line of credit  in fiscal  and  respectively 
expenditures made in connection with the expansion of the company s operating facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana and in the united kingdom  physical plant improvements in baltimore  and purchase or upgrade of laboratory equipment account for the largest portions of these expenditures in each year 
the decline in capital expenditures in fiscal is the result of the completion of expansion programs 
capital investments for the purchase of additional laboratory equipment are driven by anticipated increases in research services to be provided by the company  and by the replacement or upgrading of the company s equipment 
although the company may consider strategic acquisition opportunities it does not intend to aggressively pursue additional acquisitions until the company is fully utilizing existing capacity

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies by the company 
the company has identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
the company s other service contracts generally consist of preclinical and clinical trial studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material to the company 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
the company s product revenue is derived primarily from sales of equipment utilized for scientific research 
revenue from equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one company product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  collectively referred to as indefinite lived useful assets  are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s indefinite lived useful assets over the implied fair value of those indefinite lived useful assets 
the implied fair value of the indefinite lived useful assets is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s indefinite lived useful assets 
of the  of intangible assets acquired from lcr   was assigned to methodologies   to the customer relationships  and  to the regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site 
the company estimated the economic useful life of the acquired methodologies and customer relationships to be years with amortization recognized using the straight line method 
the company has determined that the acquired regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site is an indefinite lived intangible not subject to amortization 
of the  in value of the intangible assets acquired from pklb   in value was assigned to methodologies   in value to subject relationships  and  in value to the regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site 
the company estimated the economic useful life of the acquired methodologies and subject relationships to be years with amortization recognized using the straight line method 
the company has determined that the acquired regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site is an indefinite lived intangible not subject to amortization 
the company s estimate of fair values and allocation of the purchase price was determined with the analysis and assistance of an independent valuation firm income tax accounting income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying the provisions of tax laws in effect at the balance sheet date 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets in its balance sheet which typically represent items deducted currently in the financial statements that will be deducted in future periods in tax returns 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized in future periods 
the valuation allowance is based  in part  on management s estimate of future taxable income  the expected utilization of tax loss carry forwards and the expiration dates of tax loss carry forwards 
significant assumptions are used in developing the analysis of future taxable income for purposes of determining the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  in the opinion of management  are reasonable under the circumstances 
the company has an accumulated net deficit in its uk subsidiaries  consequently  united states deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas number dealing with inventory costs 
the statement clarifies what costs can be included in inventory  requiring that absorption factors be based on normal capacities of manufacturing facilities and excess capacity be expensed as incurred 
the company s current costing methodology substantially conforms with the new standard 
the company does not expect a material change in costing methods from adoption of this statement 
in december  sfas revised was issued dealing with share based payments 
in general  this statement requires that companies compute the fair value of options and other stock based employee incentives  and charge this value to operations over the period earned  generally the vesting period 
the only instruments we use that are governed by this statement are stock options for directors and employees 
the impact on reported results of adoption of this statement  required for interim and annual periods after june   is presented in note k to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact on operations in future periods will be determined by amortizing the remaining value of our currently outstanding options  plus the value imputed to future option grants using those methods 
there is no impact on cash flow 
in december  sfas number was revised regarding employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
we do not have any plans addressed by this revision 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is the changes in interest rates 
the credit agreement between the company and the provident bank dated october  bears interest at a rate of either the bank s prime rate plus to basis points  or at libor plus to basis points  depending in each case upon the ratio of the company s interest bearing indebtedness less subordinated debt to ebitda  at the company s option 
historically  the company has not used derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would not materially affect the consolidated operating results of the company 
while the company s revolving line of credit is at variable rates  the company elected in june   to fix its floating rate real estate mortgages at interest for a three year period 
the company operates internationally and is  therefore  subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates change 
the effect of movements in the exchange rates was not material to the consolidated operating results of the company in fiscal years  and the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not materially affect the consolidated operating results of the company
