overview the year was a successful year for transact  highlighted by the following achievements increased revenues by  or over increased operating income by  over reported record net income of  and diluted earnings per share of repaid all our outstanding bank debt finished the year with million of cash and cash equivalents we continue to focus on sales growth in our two core markets  point of sale pos and banking and gaming and lottery  and in our newly created transact services group  to drive increased profitability 
during  our total net sales grew by to approximately  see the table below for a breakdown of our sales 
change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  printers pos and banking    printers gaming and lottery    subtotal printers    services and consumables    total net sales    we experienced substantial growth in the pos and banking market in  primarily in the us  despite continued overall economic weakness 
we expect this upward trend to continue in the pos and banking market during  although mostly in the second half of our pos and banking printer sales increased by to  due primarily to growing sales of our posjet r and bankjet r lines of inkjet printers 
during  we announced wins from two major financial services companies for shipments of over  bankjet r printers to upgrade bank teller applications  which we began to ship in and substantially completed shipping during given our success in and  and in light of the renewed focus we see banks placing on branch banking  we plan to more proactively seek opportunities with other banks and credit unions for upgrading bank teller systems  if and when they arise 
in  we also plan to add two new regional sales people  broaden our product portfolio with the planned launch of two new products  and increase our focus on selling through our distribution and reseller channels 
with the global pos printer market of approximately million  we have many opportunities for market share gains  primarily through increasing and enhancing our product portfolio  increasing geographic coverage  and growing our customer base 
our focus in the gaming and lottery market is two fold 
on the lottery side  we continue to hold a leading position based on our long term purchase agreement with gtech corporation gtech  our largest customer and the world s largest provider of lottery terminals  with an approximate market share 
gtech has been our customer since  and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them 
currently  we fulfill substantially all of gtech s printer requirements for lottery terminal installations and upgrades 
during  total sales to gtech were approximately  compared to  in  representing a decrease of approximately percentage points of total revenue from based on existing orders and expected future demand for our lottery printers based on input from gtech  we expect overall sales to gtech in to be modestly higher than the level 
our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs 
our sales to gtech are not indicative of gtech s overall business or revenue 
on the gaming side  our focus lies primarily in supplying printers for use in slot machines in casinos and racetracks 
during  we continued to benefit from the conversion of traditional coin issuing slot machines to ticket issuing slot machines by casinos and racetracks across the united states 
as a result  sales of our gaming printers increased by 
we expect this trend to continue into  as casinos continue to expand and convert their slot machines  and state governments gain approval for slot machines at racetracks 
in addition  we expect to gain market share in the united states due to our relationship with igt  the world s largest slot machine manufacturer  and the launch of our new epic tm thermal casino printer 
overall  the adoption and rollout of the ticket in ticket out initiative continues  and we expect a substantial portion of the over  slot machines in north america to be fitted with a printer within the next two to three years 
beginning in  we expect growth from gaming sales internationally as well  as markets such as europe and australia begin to adopt ticket printing for their slot machines 
we also plan to broaden our sales coverage in the gaming and lottery market during to exploit the rollout of the ticket in ticket out initiative with the addition of two new sales people 
our services and consumables products  which include the repair of printers and the sale of spare parts and consumables paper  ribbons and inkjet cartridges  offer a substantial growth opportunity and recurring revenue stream for transact 
our services and consumables products revenue has grown to  of net sales in  an increase of over from during  we plan to more actively promote and dedicate increased resources to our services and consumables products in an effort to substantially increase the volume of sales 
we have added four dedicated sales people  implemented a specialized software system  and improved our sales lead tracking and prospecting processes to enable us to better cross sell our services and consumables products to our customers 
we also have established in early two new service centers a western region service center in las vegas  nv and an eastern region service center in wallingford  ct to provide national service coverage to our customers 
in addition  we believe that the increasing sales of our inkjet printers will lead to a growing installed base that will drive substantially higher inkjet cartridge sales in and beyond 
operationally  gross margin and operating margin were significantly improved and reached record highs in however  we expect to strategically invest million in the growth elements of our business during we expect that this investment will accelerate our revenue growth and with our operating leverage  should lead to a doubling of revenue and a tripling of diluted earnings per share from to we anticipate that this investment will be made across three areas an incremental million investment in sales and marketing  a  incremental investment in engineering expenses for the development of new products  four of which we expect to launch in  and a  investment in operations expenses related to the opening and staffing of our new service center in las vegas and the hiring of additional services personnel in our wallingford service center  as we broaden our reach and aggressively pursue the high margin opportunities of the transact services business 
we reported both record net income and earnings per share diluted for we also generated sufficient cash during to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  and accumulated over million of cash on our balance sheet as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
those judgments affect both balance sheet items and income statement categories 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  restructuring accruals  contingent liabilities and foreign currency translation 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our typical contracts include the sale of printers  which are sometimes accompanied by separately priced extended warranty contracts 
we also sell spare parts  consumables  and other repair services sometimes pursuant to multi year product maintenance contracts  which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the customer as needed 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within sab  revenue recognition 
specifically  revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery based on shipping terms which are generally fob shipping point has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition 
revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
pursuant to ftb  revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contract is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we record deferred revenue for amounts received from customers for maintenance contracts prior to the maintenance period 
our customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
we offer some of our customers price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and we infrequently lower prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 
however  we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  or of outstanding accounts receivable  which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of the accounts receivable 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
as of december   we had accounts receivable balances due from wms gaming  bluestar a pos distributor and gtech of  and  respectively  of the total balance due  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
as of december   we had an accounts receivable balance due from harrah s of  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we assess market value based on historical usage and estimates of future demand 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changed market conditions 
should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
as of december   our net inventory included a reserve of  or of gross inventory to write inventory down to lower of cost or market 
reserves remained at approximately the same level as in income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  as well as net operating losses  tax credits and other carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years  and match this forecast against the basis differences  deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   we recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately  and a valuation allowance of  primarily on a portion of our foreign tax credits 
we will need to recognize approximately million in future taxable income in order to realize all of our deferred tax assets at december  based on our projection of future taxable income  no additional valuation allowance is considered necessary 
should circumstances change and we determine that some or all of the deferred taxes would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment as of december  factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to  at december  and we have determined that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
restructuring in february  we announced plans to establish a global engineering and manufacturing center at our ithaca  ny facility 
as part of this strategic decision  we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing and engineering into our existing ithaca  ny facility and close our wallingford  ct manufacturing facility the consolidation 
however  our company headquarters and a service center remain in wallingford  ct 
our technology shift to inkjet and thermal printing from dot matrix impact printing dramatically reduced the labor content in our printers  and therefore  lowered the required production capacity 
as of december   we successfully transferred substantially all our wallingford product lines to ithaca  ny  with the exception of a service center that remains in connecticut 
the closing of the wallingford manufacturing facility resulted in the termination of employment of approximately production  administrative and management employees 
in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in  we recorded significant accruals 
through december   we have incurred approximately million of expenses associated with the consolidation  including severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  moving expenses  non cancelable lease payments  and other costs  of which approximately million  million and million were recognized in  and  respectively 
management has made reasonable estimates of such costs and expenses 
however  if actual costs differ from the estimates  charges or credits to income could result in the period the adjustments are determined 
we changed our estimate of the restructuring accrual related to the wallingford  ct facility resulting in additional restructuring expense in and  and a reversal of restructuring expense in we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring expenses related to the consolidation 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for a discussion of the expected impact of the consolidation on our future results of operations and cash flows 
warranty we generally warranty our products for up to months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product returns and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product return rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made 
contingencies we record an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes pursuant to fas on a quarterly basis  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
accumulated other comprehensive income stockholders equity contains certain items classified as other comprehensive income  including foreign currency translation adjustments related to our non us subsidiary that has a designated functional currency other than the us dollar 
we are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to us dollars using a combination of historical  month end and weighted average foreign exchange rates 
this combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income 
a results of operations i year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales  which include printer sales and sales of spare parts  consumables and repair services  by market for the years ended december  and were as follows change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  point of sale and banking    gaming and lottery    international    international sales do not include sales of printers made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who in turn ship those printers to international destinations 
net sales for increased  or  from due to higher shipments into both our pos and banking and gaming and lottery market 
overall  international sales increased due largely to increased sales of our casino printers into europe and australia 
point of sale and banking sales of our pos products worldwide increased approximately  or  from change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  domestic    international   domestic pos revenue increased due largely to significantly higher sales of our posjet r and bankjet r lines of inkjet printers  and increasing sales of our itherm r thermal printer 
sales of inkjet printers increased by approximately in compared to  as we shipped our bankjet r line of inkjet printers to two major financial services companies to upgrade bank teller stations 
we completed almost all shipments related to the upgrade during in addition  we reported higher service  spare parts and consumables revenue in compared to international pos and banking product revenue decreased by approximately due primarily to sales of our thermal fiscal printer in europe in that did not repeat in we discontinued our thermal fiscal printer in and do not expect any future shipments 
we expect sales into the pos market for the first quarter of to be consistent with those reported for the fourth quarter of however  we expect full year sales for to be modestly higher than those reported during  with more significant growth in the second half of gaming and lottery sales of our gaming and lottery products increased by  or  from  primarily due to significantly stronger sales of our slot machine and video lottery terminal vlt printers  somewhat offset by lower sales of lottery printers to gtech 
change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  domestic    international   change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  gaming    lottery   sales of our gaming products  which include video lottery terminal vlt and slot machine printers used in casinos and racetracks racinos  and related spare parts and repairs  increased from this increase resulted primarily from increased installations of our casino printers  primarily for use in slot machines at casinos throughout north america  europe and australia that print receipts instead of issuing coins ticket in  ticket out or tito although we expect the softness in domestic casino printer sales that we experienced in december to continue into the first half of  we expect sales or our gaming products to increase in compared to as igt integrates our new epic tm printer and casinos and other venues in europe and australia accelerate the adoption of ticket printing in the second half of total sales to gtech  which included impact and thermal on line lottery printers  impact in lane lottery printers primarily found at checkout counters of certain grocery stores  and spare parts revenue  decreased by to approximately  or of net sales  in  compared to  or of net sales  in see the table below for an analysis of revenues from gtech 
year ended december  in thousands  except impact on line lottery printers and spare parts   thermal on line lottery printers   in lane lottery printers of consolidated net sales in july  we entered into a year agreement with gtech to provide a newly designed thermal on line lottery printer 
we shipped approximately  and  of these printers during and  respectively 
based on existing orders and expected future demand based on input from gtech  we expect overall sales to gtech in to be modestly higher than the level 
our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs 
our sales to gtech are not indicative of gtech s overall business or revenue 
sales to gtech of impact on line lottery printers and spare parts totaled approximately  in  compared to  in because our thermal on line lottery printer is a replacement for our impact on line lottery printer  we do not expect any further shipments of impact on line lottery printers to gtech beyond however  we do expect to continue to sell spare parts to gtech for the significant remaining installed base of impact on line lottery printers 
shipments of in lane lottery printers totaled approximately  in  and we made no shipments of such printers in since sales of in lane lottery printers are project oriented  we cannot predict if and when future sales may occur 
international gaming and lottery product sales increased  to  from such sales represented and less than of total sales into our gaming and lottery market during and  respectively 
we experienced growth in international gaming revenue in as markets in europe and australia begin to adopt and roll out ticket printing in slot machines 
we expect more substantial growth in  as we expect sales or our gaming printers related to the rollout of ticket printing to accelerate in europe and australia  especially in the second half of gross profit 
gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts  direct labor  and the associated overhead 
gross profit increased by  or  to  and gross margin increased to from due primarily to a more favorable sales mix of higher margin products and continued reductions in component and sub component costs in compared to both gross profit and gross margin for benefited from a substantial increase in the volume of sales and a more favorable sales mix  including increased sales of higher margin gaming and lottery printers in compared to gross profit in was impacted by a charge of  or of net sales  related to a royalty payable to seiko epson for past usage of certain technology see contingent liabilities in liquidity and capital resources 
although we expect gross margin for the first quarter of to be substantially lower than the full year level due to the lower expected volume of sales in the quarter  we expect gross margin for to be at approximately the same level as that reported for engineering and product development 
engineering  design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our engineering staff  depreciation and design expenses including prototype printer expense  outside design and testing services and supplies 
such expenses increased  or  to  primarily due to compensation related expenses approximately  and expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of related to igt s integration and attainment of jurisdictional approvals for our new epic tm thermal casino printer on all of igt s slot platforms worldwide the igt integration approximately 
we expect to incur an additional  in expenses in the first quarter of related to the igt integration 
engineering and product development expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to from  primarily due to expenses related to the igt integration  largely offset by a higher sales volume in compared to we expect engineering and product development expenses to increase in as we plan to add staff and utilize more contract engineering services to continue increasing product development to expand our families of inkjet printers for the pos market and ticket issuing printers for the casino market 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff  sales commissions  travel expenses  expenses associated with the lease of sales offices  advertising  trade show expenses and other promotional marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  due primarily to higher recruitment  compensation and travel expenses related to additional sales and marketing staff  including expenses associated with the opening of our new gaming and lottery headquarters and western region service center in las vegas  to support our growing gaming printer sales approximately 
such increases were largely offset by lower print advertising and other promotional marketing expense approximately  sales commissions approximately  and expenses at our uk facility approximately  due largely to a staff reduction 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to from  due primarily to higher volume of sales in compared to we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase significantly in  as we plan to increase and broaden our sales coverage in the pos and banking market and the gaming and lottery market with the addition of new sales staff and enhanced marketing programs  as well as establish our new transact services business unit with a new dedicated sales force and two new service centers in las vegas  nv and wallingford  ct 
we believe this investment is necessary in to achieve our sales growth strategy for and beyond 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our executive  accounting  human resource and information technology staff  expenses for our corporate headquarters  professional and legal expenses  and telecommunication expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  due largely to higher professional expenses  including those related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  and additional finance staff and associated recruiting fees related to sarbanes oxley 
we incurred approximately  of external expenses directly related to compliance with sarbanes oxley during in addition  during we expensed approximately  of costs we incurred in conducting due diligence related to our proposed acquisition of tpg  inc  as the proposed acquisition was terminated 
we also incurred approximately  of one time listing fees related to our move back onto the nasdaq national market from the nasdaq smallcap market 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to from  due primarily to the factors listed above  partially offset by a higher volume of sales in compared to we expect general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in business consolidation and restructuring 
we recorded a reversal of expense of  and a charge of  related to the consolidation in and  respectively 
these amounts were substantially the result of revisions to our original estimate for non cancelable lease payments included in the restructuring accrual 
as of december   we have provided for the estimated remaining non cancelable lease payments and other related costs for this facility through the expiration of the lease march  
we do not expect to incur any further restructuring expenses related to the consolidation 
see consolidation expenses in liquidity and capital resources 
operating income 
during  we reported operating income of  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  in the significant increase in our operating income and operating margin was due largely to higher gross profit on higher sales  partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily general and administrative expenses in compared to operating income for included a reversal of expense related to the consolidation  and a charge related to the igt integration 
operating income for included a charge related to the consolidation  and a royalty payable to seiko epson for past usage of certain technology 
interest 
we recorded net interest income of  in compared to net interest expense of  in  as we repaid all outstanding revolving borrowings at december  and the remaining outstanding balance on our term loan in january we do not expect to draw on our revolving borrowings as we expect to continue to generate cash from operations during during  we expect to report increasing net interest income as our cash balance increases throughout the year 
see liquidity and capital resources below for more information 
write off of deferred financing costs 
in august  we entered into a new credit facility with banknorth na  which replaced an existing facility with lasalle business credit  inc lasalle 
we recorded a charge of approximately  in the third quarter of related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs from our prior credit facility with lasalle 
our new credit facility with banknorth contains more favorable terms than those contained in our prior facility with lasalle 
other expense 
other expense for and primarily included transaction exchange losses recorded by our uk subsidiary due to the strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of  and  in and  respectively  at an effective rate of and  respectively 
the lower effective rate in reflects a favorable outcome of a state tax audit  benefits from certain tax credits  and utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards not previously anticipated 
we expect to record income taxes at an effective rate of approximately during net income 
we reported net income in of  or per diluted share compared to net income of  or per diluted share in earnings per share have been retroactively restated for adoption of eitf participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  which requires the two class method of computing earnings per share 
the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities based upon an allocation of earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed in accordance with participation rights on undistributed earnings 
dividends paid in were approximately  and there will be no dividends or allocation of earnings to preferred shareholders beyond  as the preferred stock was converted to common stock in april all share and per share amounts reflect the april stock split on a retroactive basis 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment fasr  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for share based compensation including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options and restricted stock over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
we expect the adoption of fas r to have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share

international pos revenue decreased due primarily to lower sales of our thermal fiscal printers in europe approximately 
lower thermal fiscal printer sales were largely offset by higher sales of printers approximately  through our expanding network of international distributors and higher service  spare parts and consumables revenue approximately  largely resulting from a service contract related to printers shipped for the british post office in prior years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our available cash and cash equivalents 
in accordance with our investment policy  we strive to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital 
an effective increase or decrease of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows
