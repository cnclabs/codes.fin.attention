management overview of reportable operating segments the company is a multinational company that provides sophisticated services and related products to a variety of markets 
management defines the company s operational organizational structure into discrete divisions based on its primary product lines 
each division comprises a combination of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar types of services and serve similar types of markets 
although individual offices within a division may periodically perform services normally provided by another division  the results 
table of contents of those services are recorded in the office s own division 
for example  if a water resources division office performed geoconstruction services  the revenues would be recorded in the water resources division rather than the geoconstruction division 
should an office s primary responsibility move from one division president to another  that office s results going forward would be reclassified between divisions at that time 
the company s reportable segments are defined as follows water resources division this division provides a full line of water related services and products including hydrological studies  site selection  well design  drilling and well development  pump installation  and repair and maintenance 
the division s offerings include the design and construction of water treatment facilities and the manufacture and sale of products to treat volatile organics and other contaminants such as nitrates  iron  manganese  arsenic  radium and radon in groundwater 
the division also offers environmental services to assess and monitor groundwater contaminants 
effective february   the company s ground freezing services were included in the division on a prospective basis due to a change in reporting responsibility 
the division s operations rely heavily on the municipal sector as approximately of the division s fiscal revenues were derived from the municipal market 
the municipal sector has been adversely impacted by economic slowdowns in certain region of the country 
reduced tax revenues have limited spending and new development by local municipalities 
generally  spending levels in the municipal sector lag an economic recovery and are expected in certain regions of the country to remain at reduced levels for the first half of next year 
in addition to the reduced spending levels in the municipal market  the company has also experienced reduced demand for its services in the industrial markets 
the soft markets have increased the competitive challenges for the division as competitors have been very aggressive on pricing 
the division s margins have been adversely affected as the result of efforts to maintain market share in a difficult environment 
as the us economy continues to recover  the company expects activity levels within the water markets to improve 
the division is also expanding its water treatment product offerings and expects to see continued growth in water treatment sales in fiscal mineral exploration division this division provides a complete range of drilling services for the mineral exploration industry 
its aboveground and underground drilling activities include all phases of core drilling  diamond  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies could have a material adverse effect on the 
table of contents company 
in fiscal  the mineral exploration division experienced the first increase in worldwide exploration spending since  driven primarily by increased gold and base metal prices 
the division relies heavily on mining activity in africa where of total division revenues were generated for fiscal the company believes this concentration of risk is mitigated by working for larger international mining companies and the establishment of permanent operating facilities in africa 
operating difficulties  including but not limited to  political instability  workforce instability  harsh environment  disease and remote locations  all create natural barriers to entry in this market by competitors 
the company believes it has positioned itself as the market leader in africa and has established the infrastructure to operate effectively 
the division expects to experience continued growth next year as mining activity remains strong 
geoconstruction division this division focuses on services that improve soil stability  primarily jet grouting  grouting  vibratory ground improvement  drilled micropiles  stone columns  anchors and tiebacks 
the division also manufactures a line of high pressure pumping equipment used in grouting operations and geotechnical drilling rigs used for directional drilling 
since february   the division no longer includes the company s ground freezing services due to a change in reporting responsibility 
the geoconstruction division frequently acts as a subcontractor to heavy civil construction contractors and governmental agencies 
in many cases  circumstances outside of the company s control are inherent in a subcontractor relationship 
consequently  the division could experience delays on projects that could have a material adverse effect on the division 
the company expects the volume of large  construction type projects utilizing the company s services to improve next year in conjunction with the us economic recovery 
energy division this division primarily focuses on exploration and production of coalbed methane cbm properties in the united states 
to date this division has been concentrated on projects in the mid continent region of the united states 
historically  the division has also included service businesses in shallow gas and tar sands exploration drilling  conventional oilfield fishing services and coil tubing fishing services 
during fiscal  the division s strategy shifted to focus mainly on resource development rather than providing services to external customers 
accordingly  in january  the company sold its canadian drilling unit to ensign drilling and its oilfield fishing services to smith international 
the results of operations for these units have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the division is now composed of the company s cbm development activities and two small  specialty energy service companies 
following the sale of the two businesses in fiscal  the company has re positioned the division to focus mainly on exploration and production activities associated with its cbm properties 
the expansion of the company s 
table of contents energy segment is contingent upon significant cash investments to develop the company s unproved acreage 
as of january   the company has invested  in oil and gas related assets and expects to spend approximately  in development activities associated with its cbm efforts in fiscal the production curve for a typical cbm well is generally years 
accordingly  the company expects to earn a return on its investment through proceeds from gas production over the next years 
however  future revenues and profits will be dependent upon a number of factors including consumption levels for natural gas  commodity prices  the economic feasibility of gas exploration and production and the discovery rate of new gas reserves 
the company has gross producing wells on line as of january  the division is expected to be profitable in fiscal with sufficient production volumes generated to offset the division s level of fixed costs if the demand for clear burning fuels continues to have a favorable impact on our pricing 
products and other this grouping has historically included the company s supply operation which distributed drilling equipment  parts and supplies  a manufacturing operation producing diamond drilling rigs  diamond bits  core barrels and drill rods christensen products and other miscellaneous operations which do not fall into the above divisions 
on january   the company sold its supply operation to boart longyear 
upon the sale  the results of operations were reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents was primarily the result of severance related costs see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of approximately  incurred during the second quarter offset by cost reduction measures implemented late in fiscal fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term drilling contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to drilling sites and the ability to drill  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company believes that the following represents the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on large  long term contracts using the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
goodwill and other intangibles in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which was effective for the company as of february  sfas no 
substantially changed the accounting for goodwill  requiring that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives cease to be amortized  and instead periodically tested for impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of december each year 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about the company s strategic plans with regard to its operations 

table of contents the company believes at this time that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill is appropriate  although to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s conclusions regarding impairment of the remaining goodwill could change and result in a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
other long lived assets in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  including the company s gas transportation facilities and equipment  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated future net cash flows of the related long lived assets and reduces their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
the company believes at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued insurance expense the company maintains insurance programs where it is responsible for a certain amount of each claim up to a deductible or self insured limit 
estimates are recorded for health and welfare  property and casualty insurance costs that are associated with these programs 
these costs are estimated based on actuarially determined projections of future payments under these programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the medical profession increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee medical benefits  property and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of those funds considered to be invested indefinitely see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of coalbed methane gas reserves  by necessity  are projections base on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects 
table of contents of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
the company s estimated proved reserves at january  were prepared by independent petroleum engineering consultants cawley  gillespie associates  inc due to the early stages of completion of the company s projects  the company did not have sufficient production information with which reserves could be established for earlier periods 
oil and gas properties and mineral interests the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
normal dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized
