market risk foreign currency the company s market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company manages foreign currency market risk  from time to time  through the use of a variety of financial and derivative instruments 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue

the company also naturally hedges foreign currency through its production in the countries in which it sells its products 
the company s market risk on interest rates is the potential decrease in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential increase in interest rates

in the asia pacific region  the weaker us dollar relative to the japanese yen had a positive impact on foreign currency translation with an increase in net sales of million and an increase on net earnings of million 
the weaker us dollar relative to the australian dollar also resulted in an increase of million in net sales and an increase of million on net earnings 
in addition  the weaker us dollar relative to the south african rand also had a positive impact on foreign currency translation with an increase in net sales of million and an increase in net earnings of million 
on july   china revalued its currency by discontinuing its constant link to the us dollar and switching the link to a trade weighted basket of foreign currencies 
the effects of this change on foreign currency translation were not material to the company s financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 
table of contents the company maintains significant assets and operations in europe  countries of the asia pacific rim  south africa and mexico  resulting in exposure to foreign currency gains and losses 
a portion of the company s foreign currency exposure is naturally hedged by incurring liabilities  including bank debt  denominated in the local currency in which the company s foreign subsidiaries are located 
the foreign subsidiaries of the company purchase products and parts in various currencies 
as a result  the company may be exposed to cost increases relative to local currencies in the markets to which it sells 
to mitigate such adverse trends  the company  from time to time  enters into forward exchange contracts and other hedging activities 
additionally  foreign currency positions are partially offsetting and are netted against one another to reduce exposure 
some products made in the united states are sold abroad  primarily in europe and canada 
as a result  sales of such products are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
any long term strengthening of the us dollar could depress these sales 
also  competitive conditions in the company s markets may limit its ability to increase product pricing in the face of adverse currency movements 
interest the company s exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investments  short term borrowings and interest rate swap agreement 
the company has no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on its long term debt obligations as a result of the fixed rate nature of the debt 
however  interest rate changes would affect the fair market value of the debt 
at july   the fair value of the company s long term debt approximates market 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately million 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recorded values of certain assets and liabilities 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to generally accepted accounting principles and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates and underlying accounting assumptions are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies that require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are the most important to aid in fully understanding its financial results are the following revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue is recognized when product ownership and the risk of loss has transferred to the customer and the company has no remaining obligations 
the company records estimated discounts and rebates as a reduction of sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by management based on evaluation of potential losses related to customer receivable balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience in the industry  regional economic data and evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company feels it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
the establishment of this reserve requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have an effect on reserve balances required 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units and uses a discounted cash flow model based on management s judgments and assumptions to determine the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company transferred a component of its engine products segment to its industrial products segment along with the goodwill associated with this component 
as a result of the reclassification  the company performed an impairment test of the reporting unit to which this goodwill is now assigned 
the company also performed an impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal to satisfy its annual impairment requirement 
impairment testing in both the first and the third quarter indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and  as such  no impairment existed at that time 
other intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  an impairment charge could be required 
inventory the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
domestic inventories are valued using the last in first out lifo method  while the international subsidiaries use the first in  first out fifo method 
reserves for shrink and obsolescence are estimated using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  including issues related to specific inventory items 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have an effect on reserve balances required 
product warranty the company estimates warranty costs using standard quantitative measures based on historical warranty claim experience and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the future could impact these determinations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in the statement of operations 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels 
employee benefit plans the company incurs expenses relating to employee benefits such as noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care benefits 
in accounting for these employment costs  management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates  discount rates  overall company compensation increases  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
the company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances and uses a third party specialist to assist management in determining these estimates 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for its pension plans  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  
table of contents as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
reflecting the relatively long term nature of the plans obligations  approximately percent of the plans assets were invested in equities and percent of plans assets in alternative investments with the balance primarily invested in fixed income instruments 
a one percent change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change the annual pension expense by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the plans outside the us follows the same methodology as described above but reflects the investment allocation and expected total portfolio returns specific to each plan and country 
the company s objective in selecting a discount rate for its pension plans is to select the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan 
in making this best estimate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes looking at the universe of bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
similar appropriate benchmarks are used to determine the discount rate for the non us plans 
as of our measurement date of april   the company decreased its discount rate on us plans to percent from percent as of april  the decline of basis points was consistent with the changes in published bond indices 
the change increased the company s us projected benefit obligation as of april  by approximately million and is expected to increase pension expense in fiscal year by approximately million 
at april  the projected benefit obligation of the company s pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by million 
as of april   the company has an unrecognized actuarial loss of million which will be recognized as pension expense into the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans in accordance with sfas forward looking statements from time to time  the company  through its management  may make forward looking statements reflecting the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance

this discussion of factors is not intended to be exhaustive  but rather to highlight important risk factors that impact results 
general economic and political conditions and many other contingencies that may cause the company s actual results to differ from those currently anticipated are not separately discussed 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks associated with currency fluctuations the company maintains international subsidiaries and operations in many countries  and the results of operations and the financial position of each of the company s subsidiaries is reported in the relevant foreign currency and then translated into united states us dollars at the applicable foreign currency exchange rate for inclusion in the company s 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
as exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar fluctuate  the translation effect of such fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position as reported in us dollars 
risks associated with international operations the company does business and has manufacturing operations in numerous countries and regions  including china  hong kong  india  indonesia  japan  korea  malaysia  philippines  singapore and other asia pacific countries  western and eastern europe  the middle east  africa  canada  mexico  central america and south america 
the stability  growth and profitability of this portion of the company s business may be affected by changes in political and military events  trade  monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the united states and other trading nations 
in addition  the company s international operations are subject to the risk of new and different political and military events  legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  credit risk of local customers and distributors  potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property  risk of nationalization of private enterprises  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions  including the possibility of hyper inflationary conditions  in certain countries 
if for whatever reason  the us were to enter a recession  the demand for company products could be negatively impacted in north america and throughout the rest of the world 
competition and technology issues the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and fragmented both geographically and by application 
as a result  the company competes with numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of which are well established in their respective markets 
the company has  from time to time  experienced price pressures from competitors in certain product lines and geographic markets 
the company s competitors and new entrants into the company s lines of business can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics 
competition in the company s lines of business may limit its ability to recover future increases in labor and raw material expenses 
although the company believes that it has certain technological and other advantages over its competitors  realizing and maintaining these advantages will require continued productive investment by the company in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining such advantages 
successful product innovation by competitors that reach the market prior to comparable innovation by the company or that are amenable to patent protection may adversely affect the company s financial performance 
a number of the company s major oem customers manufacture products for their own use that compete with the company s products 
although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers  the oems could elect to manufacture products for their own use and in place of the products now supplied by the company 
in addition  customers of the company s engine filtration and exhaust products business line could decide to meet their filtration requirements through alternative methods  such as engine design modifications  rather than rely on the company s products 
risks relating to acquisitions the company has in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuance s of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect the company s profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  corporate culture conflicts  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  assumption of unanticipated legal liabilities and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions 
there can be no assurance as to the effect of acquisitions on the company s business or operating results 

table of contents environmental matters the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
the company  like many of its competitors  has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations in both the united states and abroad 
product demand considerations demand for certain of the company s products tends to be cyclical  responding historically to varying levels of construction  agricultural  heavy equipment manufacturing  mining and industrial activity in the united states and in other industrialized nations 
other factors affecting demand include the availability and cost of financing for equipment purchases and the market availability of used equipment 
sales to each of caterpillar  inc and its subsidiaries and general electric and its subsidiaries have accounted for greater than percent of the company s net sales in one or more of the last five fiscal years 
an adverse change in caterpillar s or general electric s financial performance  condition or results of operations or a material reduction in sales to this customer for any other reason could negatively impact the company s operating results 
availability and cost of product components the company obtains raw material and certain manufactured components from third party suppliers  including significant purchases of steel 
the company maintains limited raw material inventories  and as a result  even brief unanticipated delays in delivery or increases in prices by suppliers  including those due to capacity constraints  labor disputes  tariffs  impaired financial condition of suppliers  weather emergencies or other natural disasters  may adversely affect the company s ability to satisfy its customers on delivery and pricing and thereby affect the company s financial performance 
changes in the mix of products comprising revenue the company s products constitute various product lines  which have varying profit margins 
a change in the mix of products sold by the company from that currently experienced could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
research and development the company makes significant annual investment in research and development activities to develop new and improved products and manufacturing processes 
there can be no assurance that research and development activities will yield new or improved products or products which will be purchased by the company s customers  or new and improved manufacturing processes 
other factors the company wishes to caution investors that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company s results of operations
