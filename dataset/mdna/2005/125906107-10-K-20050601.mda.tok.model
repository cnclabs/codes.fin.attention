item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategic overview the company s business is roughly seasonal christmas  valentines  easter and halloween products  with the remainder being everyday product sales 
seasonal products are sold primarily to mass market retailers and the company typically has relatively high market shares in many of these categories 
most of these markets have shown little or no growth in recent years and there continues to be significant cost pressure in this area as our competitors source certain products overseas and our customers increase direct sourcing from overseas factories 
increasing customer concentration and bargaining power also contribute to price pressure 
the company is responding to these pressures in a number of ways 
first  we have increased our investment in product and packaging design and product knowledge to assure we can continue to provide unique added value to our customers 
secondly  we substantially expanded an office and showroom in the far east in fiscal to better meet our customers buying needs and to be able to provide alternatively sourced products at competitive prices 
lastly  we increased our focus on efficiency and productivity in our north american production and distribution facilities to maintain our competitiveness domestically 
our everyday product lines  principally craft  floral and packaging products  have high inherent growth potential due to higher market growth rates  particularly in craft  and to our relatively low current market shares 
we have established project teams to pursue top line sales growth in these and other areas 
the company has experienced cost increases in certain key materials 
these increases will impact fiscal and will require that management either obtain price increases from its customers or find other means of reducing material costs in the products it sells 
historically  significant growth at css has come through carefully chosen and executed acquisitions 
management anticipates that it will continue this pursuit in the future  as well 
business acquisitions and divestitures on october   a subsidiary of the company acquired all of the capital stock of crystal for approximately  including transaction costs  and assumed and repaid  of outstanding debt primarily seasonal working capital debt 
during fiscal  the company received cash of approximately  in satisfaction of a post closing adjustment to the purchase price 
crystal  which was then headquartered in middletown  ohio  is a leading designer  manufacturer and distributor of consumer convenience gift wrap products and competed in the seasonal end of the gift bag and tissue markets with the company s existing product lines 
at the time of acquisition  its product lines included gift tissue  gift bags  and related packaging products for the consumer market  as well as specialty tissues for in store packaging of retailers and for industrial applications 
a portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow for certain indemnification obligations 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired of  was recorded as intangible assets  including goodwill  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
on march   a subsidiary of the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the business and assets of the portion of offray which manufactured and sold decorative ribbon products  floral accessories and narrow fabrics for apparel  craft and packaging applications for  in cash  including transaction costs 
a portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow to cover indemnification obligations 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the cost approximated the fair market value of the net assets acquired 
litigation on february   a group of six domestic producers of tissue paper and a labor union jointly filed an antidumping duty petition with the international trade administration of the us department of commerce commerce department and the us international trade commission itc  in which the petitioners sought the imposition of duties on certain tissue paper products imported from china 
the company  as an importer from china of certain products that were the subject of these investigations  contested the imposition of these duties in proceedings before the itc and the commerce department 

back to contents in february  the commerce department issued its final determination in which it found that certain tissue paper products are being sold into the united states from china at less than fair value 
in march  the itc issued its final determination in which it found that an industry in the united states is materially injured by reason of imports from china of certain tissue paper products 
as a result of these determinations  certain tissue paper products imported from china are now subject to the imposition of tissue duties 
the company has filed an appeal of the itc s final determination  and this appeal is being litigated before the united states court of international trade 
in the fiscal year ended march   the company imported from china a portion of its requirements for gift tissue products 
given that certain of the gift tissue products that the company imported from china during the fiscal year ended march  are subject to the imposition of duties  the company has recognized an expense of approximately  reflecting the company s estimated liability for tissue duties relating to these imports 
this reserve is based on the deposit rates  as established by the commerce department  that were in effect with respect to the time that the subject tissue paper products were imported by the company 
prior to the itc s final determination  the company expensed approximately  for the possible imposition of tissue duties  including approximately  pertaining to products imported by the company prior to september  this expense was adjusted to  in the fourth quarter based upon the itc s final determination  which had the effect of eliminating the possible imposition of tissue duties with respect to tissue products imported prior to september  the amount of the company s actual liability for tissue duties pertaining to the fiscal year ended march   which liability is capped at the deposit rates in effect with respect to the period of time that the products were imported by the company  will be determined at the time of liquidation of the applicable entries by united states customs border protection 
with respect to the fiscal year ending march   the company does not intend to import from china any tissue paper products that are subject to the imposition of tissue duties pursuant to the aforementioned final determinations of the commerce department and the itc 
css and its subsidiaries are also involved in ordinary  routine legal proceedings that are not considered by management to be material 
in the opinion of company counsel and management  the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the company or its results of operations 
seasonality the seasonal nature of css business results in low sales and operating losses in the first and fourth quarters and high shipment levels and operating profits in the second and third quarters of the company s fiscal year  thereby causing significant fluctuations in the quarterly results of operations of the company 
because of the seasonality and the general industry practice of deferred payment terms  a material portion of the company s trade receivables are collected in december and january  thus enabling the company to repay the short term debt borrowed to fund the inventory and accounts receivable build up during the year 
stock split on may  the board of directors authorized a three for two common stock split  effected by a distribution on july  of one share for each two shares held of record at the close of business on june  the capital stock accounts  share data and earnings per share data are presented as if the stock split occurred prior to the earliest year included in the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal the decline in sales was the result of the absence of sales related to a product line which was sold in july and lower sales of seasonal tissue and ribbons and bows 
this sales decline was partially offset by increased sales of christmas and everyday boxed greeting cards 

back to contents cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to in from in the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  was due primarily to the establishment of a reserve of  for duties that have been imposed on imported tissue products along with higher freight costs and higher costs of paper based and polypropylene based raw materials 
the company is appealing the imposition of the tissue duties  as more fully described in the litigation section of this md a 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in from in the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to lower bonuses and net integration savings related to various restructuring activities see notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein

income before income taxes was  or of sales  in fiscal and  or of sales  in fiscal income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  were in and in the decreased rate was primarily due to the reversal of a tax contingency reserve following internal revenue service approval of a tax accounting method change  offset somewhat by higher effective state income tax rates 
net income for the year ended march  increased to  from  in fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales of crystal  acquired on october  excluding crystal  sales declined as improved sales of everyday products were offset by reduced sales of seasonal products caused primarily by the sluggish retail environment 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in from in primarily as a result of improved efficiencies and shipping performance in our halloween business 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were in and  as reduced bad debt expense and acquisition integration savings were partially offset by increased salary and other operating costs 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in primarily due to lower borrowing levels  partially offset by the impact of increased levels of fixed rate debt as a result of the issuance of  of seven year fixed rate senior notes in december see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
income before income taxes was  or of sales  in fiscal and  or of sales  in fiscal income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  were in and in the increased rate was primarily due to increased state taxes  partially offset by tax benefits associated with export sales

back to contents inflation the financial statements are presented on a historical cost basis and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation 
the us inflation rate has been modest the past several years and the company conducts the majority of its business using the us dollar 
the ability to pass on inflationary costs is uncertain due to general economic conditions and competitive situations 
the company attempts to alleviate inflationary material and labor pressures by increasing selling prices to help offset rising costs subject to competitive conditions  increasing productivity  improving design and manufacturing techniques and improving product sourcing 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of  and stockholders equity of  the decrease in accounts receivable  net of reserves  from  at march  to  at march  was primarily a result of improved collections in the current year

capital expenditures decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the company relies primarily on cash generated from its operations and seasonal borrowings to meet its liquidity requirements 
most css revenues are seasonal with approximately of sales being christmas related 
as payment for sales of christmas related products is usually not received until after the holiday selling season in accordance with general industry practice  short term borrowing needs increase throughout the second and third quarters  peaking prior to christmas and dropping thereafter 
seasonal financing requirements were met under a  revolving credit facility with five banks and an accounts receivable securitization facility with an issuer of receivables backed commercial paper 
this facility has a seasonally adjusted funding limit of  during peak seasonal periods and  during off peak seasonal periods 
in addition  the company has outstanding  of senior notes due ratably in annual installments over five years beginning in december these financing facilities are available to fund the company s seasonal borrowing needs and to provide the company with sources of capital for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions as permitted under the unsecured revolving credit facility

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable reserves  inventory reserves  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring accruals  contingency accruals and litigation accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this form k  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
revenue revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue  based primarily on historical experience  for customer returns and 
back to contents chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damaged in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase or decrease significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
accounts receivable the company offers seasonal dating programs related to certain seasonal product offerings pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms 
customers generally do not have the right to return product except for rights to return that the company believes are typical of our industry for reasons such as damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
with few exceptions  the company is not required to repurchase products from its customers  nor does the company have any regular practice of doing so 
in addition  the company mitigates its exposure to bad debts by evaluating the creditworthiness of its major customers and purchasing credit insurance when appropriate 
bad debt and returns and allowances reserves are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable while reserves for customer programs are recorded as accrued liabilities 
the company evaluates accounts receivable related reserves and accruals monthly by specifically reviewing customer accounts and by reference to historical experience 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is primarily determined by the first in  first out method although certain inventories are valued based on the last in  first out method 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
product development costs product development costs consist of purchases of outside artwork  printing plates  cylinders  catalogs and samples 
the company classifies these costs as a prepaid expense 
product development costs may be incurred up to to months before the holiday event and are amortized monthly over the selling season  generally within two to four months of the respective holiday event 
product development expense is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  however  goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test  the first step of which must be performed at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for each of the reporting units  the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a multiple of earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense  except at the transition date  when the loss was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense state  federal and foreign  including the impact of permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included 
back to contents within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
labor relations the term of the collective bargaining agreement between the company s cleo subsidiary and the labor union representing approximately non supervisory production and maintenance employees at the gift wrap plant and warehouses in memphis  tennessee expired on january  cleo has continued to follow the terms of the expired collective bargaining agreement  and cleo and the labor union have engaged in negotiations concerning the provisions of a new agreement 
however  as of may   cleo and the labor union have not reached an agreement on a new contract  and there presently are no ongoing or scheduled negotiations between cleo and the labor union

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s activities expose it to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial exposures are actively monitored and  where considered appropriate  managed by the company 

back to contents interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
pursuant to the company s variable rate lines of credit  a change in either the lender s base rate or libor would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds thereunder 
based on average borrowings under these credit facilities of  for the year ended march   a increase or decrease in floating interest rates would have increased or decreased interest expense by approximately  foreign currency risk approximately of the company s sales in fiscal were denominated in a foreign currency 
the company considers its risk exposure with regard to foreign currency fluctuations minimal as it enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the majority of firmly committed transactions and related receivables that are denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has designated its foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges 
the gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized in earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the foreign denominated assets that they are intended to hedge
