in june  the uaic successfully negotiated a new tribal state gaming compact amended compact with the state of california which has received approval by the doi 
the amended compact allows an unlimited number of slot machines at thunder valley and extends the term an additional years to the amended compact also includes a revenue sharing agreement with the state of california 
thunder valley has added approximately slot machines and as a result  the uaic will pay approximately million annually to the state of california commencing in january and additional fees ranging from  to  per machine for any slot machines added above the  that were originally in operation at thunder valley prior to the amended compact 
the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenue  particularly to the state of nevada and its counties and municipalities 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law  or in the administration of such law  affecting the gaming industry 
nevada legislature is currently in session and there has been no mention of significant tax proposals which would affect the gaming industry 
we believe that our recorded tax balances are adequate 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or in the administration of such law  regulations or compact provisions 
such changes  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we recently settled and finalized the internal revenue service audits up through and including the years ended december  cash transaction reporting violations in april  we became aware of violations of certain gaming regulations regarding the reporting of certain cash transactions 
we self reported these violations to the nevada state gaming control board

we have hired additional staff at each property and have increased the level of internal audit review to prevent this type of violation in the future

the interest rate swaps we entered into qualify for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and as amended by sfas no 
 which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness

instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
in accordance with sfas no

rights plan on october   we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on october  each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one hundredth of a share of series a preferred stock  par value per share preferred shares at a price of per one one hundredth of a preferred share  subject to adjustment 
the rights are not exercisable until the earlier of days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons have acquired beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common stock acquiring person or business days or such later date as may be determined by action of the board of directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an acquiring person following the commencement of  or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of or more of our outstanding common stock

critical accounting policies significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the determination of slot club program liability  the estimated useful lives assigned to our assets  asset impairment  insurance reserves  purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
to provide an understanding of the methodology we apply  our significant accounting policies and basis of presentation are discussed below  as well as where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
slot club programs our boarding pass and amigo club player rewards programs the programs allow customers to redeem points earned from their gaming activity at all station and fiesta properties for complimentary food  beverage  rooms  entertainment and merchandise 
at the time redeemed  the retail value of complimentaries under the programs are recorded as revenue with a corresponding offsetting amount included in promotional allowances 
the cost associated with complimentary food  beverage  rooms  entertainment and merchandise redeemed under the programs is recorded in casino costs and expenses 
we also record a liability for the estimated cost of the outstanding points under the programs 
self insurance reserves we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for workers compensation  major medical and general liability costs 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
derivative instruments we enter into interest rate swaps from time to time in order to manage interest rate risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings 
the interest rate swaps that we have entered into qualify for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and as amended by sfas no 
 which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the capitalized lease  whichever is less 
costs of major improvements are capitalized  while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset to be sold at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal 
fair market value for assets to be disposed of is generally estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review fixed assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
if an indicator of impairment exists  we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value  with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model 
our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments required by sfas no 
as of december  goodwill and other intangibles the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in june sfas no 
changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon the adoption of sfas no 
we implemented sfas no 
on january  and tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter of and annually perform such test 
in order to test for impairment of goodwill  we use the income approach  which focuses on the income producing capability of the respective property 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the subject asset 
the steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected after tax cash flows attributable to the respective property and converting these after tax cash flows to present value through discounting 
the discounting process uses a rate of return  which accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors 
the present value of the after tax cash flows is then totaled to arrive at an indication of the fair value of the goodwill 
if the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying value  then impairment is measured based on the difference between the calculated fair value and the carrying value 
our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments required by sfas no 
as of december  income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states of america and file a consolidated federal income tax return 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on alternative fair value models 
the share based compensation cost will be measured based on fair value models of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the stock option grants fair value using the black scholes model and disclosing the impact on net income and net income per share in a note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption  pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we will begin to apply sfas no 
r using an appropriate fair value model as of the interim reporting period ending september  based on stock options outstanding as of december   we estimate approximately million in related expense to be recorded during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under the revolving facility 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a margin above the alternate base rate or the eurodollar rate each as defined in the revolving facility as selected by us 
however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate and may be reduced from time to time 
the revolving facility matures in december the following table provides information about our long term debt at december  see also description of certain indebtedness and capital stock amounts in thousands maturity date face amount carrying value estimated fair value revolving facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately december senior subordinated notes february senior notes april senior subordinated notes march senior subordinated notes july senior notes february other debt  interest at market value of interest rate swaps total we are also exposed to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates and their potential impact upon our debt 
this market risk is managed by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace  and do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our derivative financial instruments consist exclusively of interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched with specific fixed rate debt obligations
