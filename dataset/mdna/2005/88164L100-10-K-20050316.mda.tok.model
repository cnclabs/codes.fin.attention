item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop semiconductor packaging technology that meets the demand for miniaturization and increased performance of electronic products 
we license our technology to our customers  enabling them to produce semiconductors that are smaller and faster  and incorporate more features 
these semiconductors are utilized in a broad range of communications  computing and consumer electronics products 
in addition  by utilizing our technology  we believe that our customers are also able to reduce the time to market and development costs of their semiconductors 
from our inception in through  we engaged principally in research and development activities related to chip scale and multi chip packaging technology 
we began generating revenues from licenses of our intellectual property in we began manufacturing activities in to support market acceptance of our technology 
we discontinued most of these manufacturing activities in  after many suppliers had developed the manufacturing infrastructure to implement our technology 
we continue to develop prototypes and manufacture limited volumes of select products 
we generate revenues from two primary sources intellectual property  which represents the majority of our revenues and consists of license fees for our patented technologies and royalties on semiconductors shipped by our licensees that employ these patented technologies  and services  which utilize or further our intellectual property 
licensees pay a non refundable license fee 
revenues from license fees are generally recognized once the license agreement has been executed by both parties 
in some instances  we provide training to our licensees under the terms of the license agreement 
the amount of training provided is limited and is incidental to the licensed technology 
accordingly  in instances where training is provided under the terms of a license agreement  a portion of the license fee is deferred until the training has been provided 
the amount of revenue deferred is based on the price we charge for similar services when they are sold separately 
semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers pay on going royalties on their shipment of semiconductors incorporating our intellectual property 
royalty payments are primarily based upon the number of electrical connections to the semiconductor chip in a package covered by our technology  although we do have arrangements in which royalties are paid based upon a percent of the net sales price 
our licensees report royalties quarterly  and most also pay on a quarterly basis 
as there is no reliable basis on which to estimate our royalty revenues prior to obtaining these reports from our licensees  we recognize royalty revenue when we 
table of contents receive a royalty report from our customer 
we receive these reports the quarter after the semiconductors that incorporate our technology have been shipped 
from time to time  we receive payments through license negotiations or the resolution of patent disputes 
these settlements generally include amounts for royalties related to previous periods based on historical production volumes 
these amounts are reported as other intellectual property revenues in the statement of operations 
other intellectual property revenue will vary significantly on a quarterly basis 
service revenues are primarily derived from engineering services  including related training services 
revenues from services related to training are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from other services are recognized on a percentage of completion or completed contract method of accounting depending on the nature of the project 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues recognized are that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs based on current estimates of the costs to complete the projects 
if the total estimated costs to complete a project were to exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss would be recognized immediately 
revenues under the completed contract method are recognized upon acceptance by the customer or in accordance with the contract specifications 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licensees headquartered outside of the united states  principally in asia  and these revenues accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  we expect that these revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues in future periods 
all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
for the year ended december   intel corporation and texas instruments each accounted for over of total revenues 
for the year ended december   texas instruments accounted for over of total revenues 
we license most of our csp and multi chip packaging technology under a license that we refer to as a tessera compliant chip  or tcc  license 
the tcc license grants a worldwide right under the licensed patent claims to assemble  use and sell certain csps and multi chip packages 
we generally license semiconductor material suppliers under our tessera compliant mounting tape  or tcmt  license 
the tcmt license calls for a one time license fee and  unlike most of our other licenses  does not require ongoing royalty payments 
cost of revenues consists primarily of direct compensation  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation costs 
cost of revenues primarily relates to service revenues as the cost of revenues associated with intellectual property revenues is de minimis 
consequently  cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues will vary based on the percentage of our revenues that is attributable to service revenues 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel as well as costs related to patent applications and examinations  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation 
our research and development is conducted primarily in house and targets both csp and multi chip technology 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that a significant level of research and development expenses will be required for us to remain competitive in the future 
we have increased research and development personnel to at december  from at december   and expect to continue to increase research and development personnel in the future 
selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  marketing programs  public relations  promotional materials  travel and related trade show expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for general management  information technology  finance and accounting personnel  litigation expenses and related fees  facilities costs  and professional services 
our general and administrative expenses are not allocated to other expense line items 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  related regulations and ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
excluding litigation expenses  we expect that as a percentage of revenues  
table of contents these expenses will decrease over time 
however  we expect that litigation expenses will continue to be a material portion of our general and administrative expenses in future periods  and may increase significantly in some periods  because of our litigation with samsung  described above in legal proceedings  and because we expect that we will become involved in other litigation from time to time in the future in order to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
in connection with the grant of stock options from through  we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred stock based compensation within stockholders equity  due to the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of common stock on the date of grant 
the compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of generally four years 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized through results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues fiscal year ended december  revenues intellectual property revenues other intellectual property revenues service revenues total revenues operating expenses cost of revenues research and development selling  general and administrative stock based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net income before taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income fiscal year and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the million increase was primarily due to a million increase in intellectual property revenues  a million increase in other intellectual property revenues and a million increase in service revenues 
intellectual property revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase of million or consisted of million from new customers and million from existing customers 
the increases are attributable to the signing of five new licensees and an increase in royalties reported by existing customers 
other intellectual property revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase of million or was primarily 
table of contents due to resolutions of negotiations with nec electronics corporation  oki electronic industry co 
ltd 
and united test and assembly center ltd  totaling million and million from existing customers  which includes the million payment received from samsung electronics for royalties relating to past production 
these resolutions were greater than the aggregate amount negotiated with five customers in the year ended december  which totaled to approximately million 
service revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase is directly related to the increase in number of government contracts 
for the year ended december   revenues from government contracts increased by million or over the year ended december  revenues from government contracts for the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  primarily due to increased costs associated with an increase in service revenues 
cost of revenues primarily relates to service revenues as the cost of revenues associated with intellectual property revenues is de minimis 
for the year ended december  and cost of revenues represented and respectively  of service revenues for each associated year 
cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues will vary based on the service revenues component of total revenues 
the majority of this increase in the year of was attributable to the allocation of more personnel to service related projects and an increase in the number of these projects 
increased materials and subcontractor costs related to service related projects also accounted for part of the increase in cost of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this decrease of  in expenses is primarily due to the reassignment of more personnel resources to service revenues projects 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to the costs of being a public company and our litigation with samsung  described above in legal proceedings 
the increased costs related to being a public company are primarily salaries  professional fees and insurance 
for the year ended december  these costs were million  which included  of professional charges for the company s secondary public offering that closed on march  total litigation expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to incur litigation expenses in upcoming quarters 
the addition of personnel and personnel related expenses for the expansion of sales and marketing efforts also contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower amortization of deferred compensation related to issuance of stock options in through interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is directly related to income earned on higher cash balances as a result of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering in november and positive cash flow generated from operations 
benefit and provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision benefit of million consisting of  of alternative minimum tax amt  million of foreign withholding taxes off set by a benefit for the recognition of deferred tax assets of million 
the million benefit is due to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our net operating loss  nol 
due to 
table of contents historic and current income  prospects of future book income and the resolution of the samsung litigation  management determined that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary  as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
for the year ended december   the provision of million consisted of  of amt and million of foreign withholding taxes 
foreign withholding taxes paid  relate to statutory withholding taxes on license and royalty revenues earned in japan  korea and singapore 
we paid no federal or state income taxes in the year ended december  primarily due to our operating nol and allowable stock option deductions related to gains that our employees realized on the exercise and sale of their stock options 
in the year ended december   we paid no state income taxes 
fiscal year and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the million increase was primarily due to a million increase in intellectual property revenues and a million increase in service revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in other intellectual property revenues 
the increase in intellectual property revenues was principally due to a million increase in revenues from existing licensees and a million increase in revenues from signing of new licensees 
the increase in revenues from existing licensees was primarily due to increased sales by our licensees of semiconductors that incorporate our technology  resulting in increased royalty payments 
the increase in revenues from new licensees is primarily due to royalty payments 
the increase in service revenues is due to service contracts entered into with new customers in late and early other intellectual property revenues declined by million primarily because the amounts we received upon our litigation settlement with sharp corporation in  totaling million  and upon resolution of negotiations with hitachi  rohm  samsung and toshiba  totaling million  were greater than the aggregate amounts we received upon resolution of negotiations with intel  mitsubishi  sanyo  seiko epson and shinko in  which totaled approximately million 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  primarily due to increased costs associated with an increase in service revenues 
cost of revenues primarily relates to service revenues as the cost of revenues associated with intellectual property revenues is de minimis 
cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenue will vary based on the service revenues component of total revenues 
the majority of this increase in the year of was attributable to the allocation of more personnel to service related projects and an increase in the number of these projects 
increased materials and subcontractor costs related to service related projects also accounted for part of the increase in cost of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenues from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this increase in expenses was primarily due to the addition of personnel  which increased to people as of december  as compared to as of december  and personnel related costs to accommodate our expanding research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to our ongoing litigation with samsung 
total litigation expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  we expect to continue to incur litigation expenses related to the samsung legal proceeding in upcoming quarters 
the addition of personnel and personnel related expenses for the expansion of sales and marketing efforts also contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower amortization of deferred compensation related to issuance of stock options in through 
table of contents interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to a one time charge for a foreign translation loss of  in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the provision consisted of  of federal alternative minimum tax  or amt  and million of foreign withholding taxes 
for the year ended december   the total provision of million related to foreign withholding taxes 
foreign withholding taxes paid relate to statutory withholding taxes on license and royalty revenues earned in japan and korea

table of contents due to a slight decrease in royalty revenue from the prior quarter 
the decline in june  was due to the timing of our signing of new licensees in the prior quarter 
other intellectual property revenues have been significantly impacted by revenues related to the resolution of license negotiations and patent disputes  particularly in the quarters ended june  and september   due to our resolution of negotiations with nec electronics corporation and the million payment from samsung electronics  respectively 
cost of revenues has generally increased throughout and consistent with overall growth in service revenues 
our costs of revenues primarily relate to service revenues 
operating expenses generally increased throughout and due to the costs of being a public company and litigation expenses related to the samsung case  described above in legal proceedings 
if litigation expenses are excluded  operating expenses have generally increased in and to support our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations regarding corporate governance and the growth in revenues 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
approximately million of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards related to stock option deductions 
the difference between the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards is attributable to the capitalization of research and development costs for state purposes 
these operating loss carryforwards began to expire on various dates beginning in  and will continue to expire through under the provisions of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and  more recently  through cash generated from operations 
we have received a total of million from private offerings of our equity securities and we generated million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in november at december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  operating cash flows in were generated from net income adjusted for non cash expenses of million and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and  respectively  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  this was partially off set by an increase in accounts receivable of  and other assets of million

this was partially off set by increases in accounts receivable and other assets of  and  respectively 
the increase in accrued liabilities is directly related to increased litigation expenses related to the samsung case  described above in 
table of contents legal proceedings 
net cash generated by operating activities for the year ended december  was generated primarily from net income adjusted for non cash expenses of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
this was partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities of million and deferred revenue of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the collection of a receivable related to a legal settlement with texas instruments late in the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to payment of litigation costs 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million consisting of million of property and equipment purchases  off set by  of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  due to the sales of short term marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to net purchases of short term marketable securities  and was primarily funded by cash from operations 
for the year ended december   net cash flows provided by financing activities were directly related to net proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants and from the proceeds of our employee stock purchase program 
net cash provided by financing activities for year ended december  was million comprised primarily of net proceeds of million from the company s initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities for the comparable period in was  representing  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options off set partially by repayment of capital lease obligations 
we believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  our cash from operations  together with cash currently available  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses  unanticipated acquisitions of technologies or businesses or unanticipated strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available when needed or  if available  that the financing will be on terms satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current stockholders 
contractual cash obligations as of december  the following sets forth our minimum commitments under operating leases year ended december  amount in thousands thereafter total minimum lease commitments critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those 
table of contents estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue at the time until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
estimating accrued liabilities 
we review our accounts payable and accrued liabilities at each reporting period  and accrue liabilities as appropriate 
during this analysis we consider items such as research and development activity  commitments made to or the level of activity with vendors  payroll and employee related costs  historic spending  budgeted spending and anticipated changes in the costs of services 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
when such an event occurs  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
to date  no impairment loss has been recognized 
we assess the impairment in value to our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
stock based compensation 
our amended and restated equity incentive plan is accounted for in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and complies with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure sfas 
expense associated with stock based compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual award consistent with the method described in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and fin 
we account for stock issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf 
under sfas and eitf  stock option awards issued to non employees are accounted for at fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
we believe that the fair value of the stock options are more reliably 
table of contents measured than the fair value of the services received 
the fair value of each non employee stock award is remeasured at each period end until a commitment date is reached  which is generally the vesting date 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million which were fully reserved with a tax valuation allowance 
during  the deferred tax assets increased by approximately million to million 
additionally during  management determined that it is more likely than not that certain future tax benefits will be realized as a result of historic and current income  prospects of future book income and the resolution of the samsung litigation 
accordingly  we reduced the tax valuation allowance by million to reflect the anticipated utilization of the deferred tax assets 
the remaining deferred tax valuation allowance of million relates to deferred tax assets from federal and state net operating losses resulting from stock option deductions 
when recognized  the tax benefit from the loss carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital 
litigation and contingencies 
from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain  and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from others  limit the value of our technologies and otherwise negatively impact over business 
if we believe that it is probable for a certain proceeding to result in an adverse decision and that the loss is estimable  we would establish an appropriate accrual for the loss 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for the company in the quarter ending december  the company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting this new standard 

table of contents risk factors a court invalidation or limitation of our key patents could significantly harm our business 
our patent portfolio contains some patents that are particularly significant to our ongoing revenues and business 
if any of these key patents are invalidated  or if a court limits the scope of the claims in any of these key patents  the likelihood that companies will take new licenses and that current licensees will continue to agree to pay under their existing licenses could be significantly reduced 
the resulting loss in license fees and royalties could significantly harm our business 
we may become involved in litigation with our licensees  potential licensees or strategic partners  which could harm our business 
we may become involved in a dispute relating to our intellectual property or our contracts  which could include or be with a licensee  potential licensee or strategic partner 
our former lawsuit with samsung a licensee and our current lawsuit with infineon and micron potential licensees  as described above in legal proceedings  are examples 
any such dispute could cause the licensee or strategic partner to cease making royalty or other payments to us and could substantially damage our relationship with the company on both business and technical levels 
any litigation stemming from such a dispute could be very expensive and may cause us to cease being profitable 
litigation could also severely disrupt or shut down the business operations of our licensees or strategic partners  which in turn would significantly harm our ongoing relations with them and cause us to lose royalty revenues 
any such litigation could also harm our relationships with other licensees or our ability to gain new customers  who may postpone licensing decisions pending the outcome of the litigation 
in addition  many semiconductor and package assembly companies maintain their own internal design groups and have their own package design and manufacturing capabilities 
if we believe these groups have designed technologies that infringe upon our intellectual property  and if they fail to enter into a license agreement with us or pay for licensed technology  then we may be forced to commence legal proceedings against them 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our business will suffer 
we rely primarily on a combination of license  development and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our licensees and others may seek to use our technology without the payment of license fees and royalties  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation 
the growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to convince third parties of the applicability of our intellectual property to their products  and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights against them 
in certain instances  we attempt to obtain patent protection for portions of our intellectual property portfolio  and our license agreements typically include both issued patents and pending patent applications 
if we fail to obtain patents or if the patents issued to us do not cover all of the claims we asserted in our patent applications  others could use portions of our intellectual property without the payment of license fees and royalties 
we also rely on trade secret law rather than patent law to protect other portions of our proprietary technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and customers 
we cannot be certain that these contracts have not been and will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
if we fail to use these mechanisms to protect our intellectual property  or if a court fails to enforce our contractual provisions with respect to these rights  our business will suffer 
we cannot be certain that these protection mechanisms can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated or challenged 

table of contents we may not be able to protect our confidential information  and this could adversely affect our business 
we generally enter into contractual relationships with our employees that protect our confidential information 
the misappropriation of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we may not be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
in the event we are unable to enforce these contractual obligations and our intellectual property rights  our business could be adversely affected 
we may be required to undertake costly legal proceedings to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights and this may harm our business 
in the past we have found it necessary to litigate to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
we currently are involved in litigation with micron and infineon regarding our intellectual property rights  as described above in legal proceedings  and we expect to be involved in similar litigation in the future 
litigation is inherently uncertain and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from others  limit the value of our licensed technology and otherwise negatively impact our business 
whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  litigation is costly and diverts our managerial  technical  legal and financial resources from our business operations 
our revenues may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce our intellectual property rights or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 
we rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries  and agreements with our employees  customers  suppliers and other parties  to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in our technology 
however  any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
further  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our technology adequately against unauthorized third party use  which could adversely affect our business 
third parties also may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we believe that the claims are without merit  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards 
even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreements to us 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source  our business could suffer 
a significant amount of our royalty revenues comes from a few market segments and products  and our business could be harmed if these market segments or products decline 
a significant portion of our royalty revenues comes from the manufacture and sale of packaged semiconductor chips for dsp  asic and memory 
in addition  we derive substantial revenues from the incorporation of our technology into wireless phones 
if demand for semiconductors in any one or a combination of these market segments or products declines  our royalty revenues may be reduced and our business could be harmed 
moreover  were such a decline to occur  our business could become more cyclical in nature 
our revenue is concentrated in a few customers and if we lose any of these customers our revenues may decrease substantially 
we receive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
in fiscal  revenues from our top customer  texas instruments and intel  accounted for and respectively  of our 
table of contents total revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a few customers for the foreseeable future 
if we lose any of these customers  or if our revenues from them decline  our revenues may decrease substantially 
future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue and expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  in the year the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments sbp  fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment fas r  that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards using fair value methodologies 
this accounting change  scheduled for an effective date of june  or any changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could have a significant negative effect on our reported results and on our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results as a result of the variability of the factors used to establish the value of stock options 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 
we have agreements relating to services provided to government entities and  as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to audits relating to compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 
a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts  debarment from future government contracts  or civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  the government may acquire certain intellectual property rights in data produced or delivered under such contracts and inventions made under such contracts 
our financial and operating results may vary which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we currently provide guidance on revenue and expense and cash taxes on a quarterly and annual basis 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
because our operating results are difficult to predict  you should not rely on quarterly or annual comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
we have had positive net income since the fourth quarter of factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate during any period include those listed in this risk factors section of this report and the following the timing and compliance with license or service agreement and the terms and conditions for payment to us of license or service fees under these agreements  changes in our royalties caused by changes in demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology  the amount of our service revenues  changes in the level of our operating expenses  delays in our introduction of new technologies or market acceptance of these new technologies through new license agreements  
table of contents our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  legal proceedings affecting our patents or patent applications  the timing of the introduction by others of competing technologies  changes in demand for semiconductor chips in the specific markets in which we concentrate digital signal processor dsp semiconductors  application specific integrated circuits asic semiconductors  and memory  changes in accounting principles or a requirement to treat stock option grants as an operating expense  and cyclical fluctuations in semiconductor markets generally 
it is difficult to predict when we will enter into license agreements 
the time it takes to establish a new licensing arrangement can be lengthy 
delays or deferrals in the execution of license agreements may also increase as we develop new technologies 
because we generally recognize a significant portion of license fee revenues in the quarter that the license is signed  the timing of signing license agreements may significantly impact our quarterly or annual operating results 
under our typical license agreements  we also receive ongoing royalty payments  and these may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on sales of products incorporating our licensed technology 
we expect to expand our business rapidly which will require us to increase our operating expenses 
we may not be able to increase revenues in an amount sufficient to offset these increased expenditures  which may lead to a loss for a quarterly period 
due to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and other factors  the price at which our common stock will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
in future periods  if our revenues or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price could decline 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of their securities 
technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility than companies in many other industries in recent years and  as a result  have  on average  been subject to a greater number of securities class action claims 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business 
system security risks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers  which could harm our revenue  increase our expenses and harm our reputation and stock price 
despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures and the continuous monitoring of our internal information technology networking systems processes and controls  our systems are vulnerable to damages from numerous sources  including but not limited to  computer viruses  unauthorized access  energy blackouts  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication failures 
experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns 
as a result  we could incur significant expenses in addressing problems created by security breaches of our network 
in addition  hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture  including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 
the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems  viruses and bugs could be significant  and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service that may impede critical operating functions 
portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions  delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems integration work 
in particular  we are in the process of implementing new financial reporting and enterprise resource planning software 
as a part of this effort  we are 
table of contents also upgrading hardware and existing software applications to support new implementations and administer our business information 
we may not be successful in implementing the new systems and transitioning data and other aspects of the process could be expensive  time consuming  disruptive and resource intensive 
any disruptions that may occur in the implementation of the new systems or any future systems could adversely affect our ability to report in an accurate and timely manner the results of our operations  our financial position and cash flows 
disruptions to these systems could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to provide services and support to our customers and fulfill contractual obligations 
as a result  our results of our operations  financial position  cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 
we recently evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required for compliance with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section while we have implemented the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions for future finance related projects or the impact of the same on our operations since there is no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy 
current infrastructure projects to replace legacy accounting systems and other systems related to financial information require that we implement the requirements of section in a timely manner for these new applications 
if we do not complete these requirements in a timely fashion or with adequate compliance  we might be subject to investigation by regulatory authorities and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls  which could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
in addition  to the extent that we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify a significant deficiency in our internal controls  the resources and costs required to remediate such deficiency could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we have a royalty based business model  which is inherently risky 
our long term success depends on future royalties paid to us by licensees 
royalty payments are primarily based upon the number of electrical connections to the semiconductor chip in a package covered by our licensed technology  although we do have royalty arrangements in which royalties are paid based upon a percent of the net sales price or in which royalties are paid on a per package basis 
we are dependent upon our ability to structure  negotiate and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of royalties 
we face risks inherent in a royalty based business model  many of which are outside of our control  such as the following the rate of adoption and incorporation of our technology by semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers  the extent to which large equipment vendors and materials providers develop and supply tools and materials to enable manufacturing using our packaging technology  the demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology  and the cyclicality of supply and demand for products using our licensed technology 
it is difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements  and this may cause us to lose revenues 
the standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us on a quarterly basis 
although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information  audits can be expensive  time consuming and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees 
as a result  to date  we have primarily relied on the accuracy of the reports themselves without independently 
table of contents verifying the information in them 
our failure to audit our licensees books and records may result in us receiving less royalty revenues than we are entitled to under the terms of our license agreements 
failure by our licensees to introduce products using our technology could limit our royalty revenue growth 
because we expect a significant portion of our future revenues to be derived from royalties on semiconductors that use our licensed technology  our future success depends upon our licensees developing and introducing commercially successful products 
any of the following factors could limit our licensees ability to introduce products that incorporate our technology the willingness and ability of materials and equipment suppliers to produce materials and equipment that support our licensed technology  in a quantity sufficient to enable volume manufacturing  the ability of our licensees to purchase such materials and equipment on a cost effective and timely basis  the willingness of our licensees and others to make investments in the manufacturing process that supports our licensed technology  and the amount and timing of those investments  and our licensees ability to design and assemble packages incorporating our technology that are acceptable to their customers 
failure by the semiconductor industry to adopt new high performance dram chips that utilize our packaging technology would significantly harm our business 
to date  our packaging technology has been used by several companies for high performance dynamic random access memory  or dram  chips 
for example  packaging using our technology was designated by rambus as the reference design package for its high performance rambus dram chips 
however  the dram designed by rambus has not been widely adopted due to the use of competing technologies such as the first generation of ddr dram  which does not widely utilize advanced packaging technologies 
dram manufacturers are also currently developing new high performance dram chips such as the next generation of ddr  referred to as ddr and ddr  to meet increasing speed and performance requirements of electronic products 
we believe that these new high performance dram chips will require advanced packaging technologies such as csp  and we currently have licensees  including samsung  who are paying royalties for ddr chips in advanced packages 
we anticipate that royalties from shipments of these new  high performance dram chips packaged using our technology may account for a significant percentage of our future revenues 
if semiconductor manufacturers do not adopt new  high performance dram as quickly as is currently being projected by industry sources or find an alternate viable packaging technology for use with their high performance dram chips  or if we do not receive royalties from new  high performance dram chips that use our technology  our future revenues could be adversely affected 
our technology may be too expensive for certain new  high performance dram manufacturers  which could significantly reduce the adoption rate of our packaging technology in new  high performance dram chips 
even if our package technology is selected for at least some of these new  high performance dram chips  there could be delays in the introduction of products utilizing these chips that could materially affect the amount and timing of any royalty payments that we receive 
other factors that could affect adoption of our technology for new  high performance dram products include delays or shortages of materials and equipment and the availability of testing services 
competing technologies may harm our business 
we expect that our technologies will continue to compete with technologies of internal design groups of semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers 
these internal design groups create their own packaging solutions  
table of contents and have direct access to their company s technical information and technology roadmaps  and have capacity  cost and technical advantages over us 
if these internal design groups design around our patents  they may not need to license our technology 
these groups may design package technology that is less expensive to implement than ours or provides products with higher performance or additional features 
many of these groups have substantially greater resources  financial or otherwise  than us and lower cost structures 
as a result  they may be able to get their package technology adopted more easily and quickly 
for instance  certain flip chip technologies are being used by large semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers for a variety of semiconductors  including processors and memory 
another example of a competitive technology is the small format lead frame packages that are also gaining popularity 
the companies using these technologies are utilizing their current lead frame infrastructure to achieve cost effective results 
in the future  our licensed technologies may also compete with other package technologies 
these technologies may be less expensive than ours and provide higher or additional performance 
companies with these competing technologies may also have greater resources than us 
technological change could render our technologies obsolete  and new  competitive technologies could emerge that achieve broad adoption and adversely affect the use of our intellectual property 
if we do not create and implement new designs to expand our licensable technology portfolio  our competitive position could be harmed and our operating results adversely affected 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licenses and royalties from a relatively small number of key technologies 
we plan to devote significant engineering resources in order to develop new packaging technologies to address the evolving needs of the semiconductor and the consumer electronic industries 
to remain competitive  we must introduce new technologies or designs in a timely manner and the market must adopt them 
developments in packaging technologies are inherently complex  and require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability 
we may not be able to develop and market new technologies in a timely or commercially acceptable fashion 
moreover  our currently issued us patents expire at various times from january  through may  we need to develop and patent successful innovations before our current patents expire 
we also may attempt to expand our licensable technology portfolio and technical expertise by acquiring technology or developing strategic relationships with others 
these strategic relationships may include the right for us to sublicense technology to others 
however  we may not be able to acquire or obtain rights to licensable technology in a timely manner or upon commercially reasonable terms 
moreover  our research and development efforts  and acquisitions and strategic relationships  may be futile if we do not accurately predict the future packaging needs of the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries 
our failure to develop or acquire new technologies could significantly harm our business 
our licensing cycle is lengthy and costly and our marketing and sales efforts may be unsuccessful 
we generally incur significant marketing and sales expenses prior to entering into our license agreements  generating a license fee and establishing a royalty stream from each licensee 
the length of time it takes to establish a new licensing relationship can range from to months or longer 
as such  we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins 
we employ intensive marketing and sales efforts to educate materials suppliers  equipment vendors  licensees  potential licensees and original equipment manufacturers about the benefits of our technologies 
in addition  even if these companies adopt our technologies  they must devote significant resources to integrate fully our technologies into their operations 
if our marketing and sales efforts are unsuccessful  then we will not be able to achieve widespread acceptance of our packaging technology 

table of contents cyclicality in the semiconductor industry may affect our revenues  and as a result  our operating results could be adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  this industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product and technology cycles  excess inventories and declines in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next 
our business depends heavily upon the volume of production by our licensees  which  in turn  depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors 
similarly  our services business relies at least in part upon the outsourcing of design and engineering projects by the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor manufacturers and package assembly companies generally sharply curtail their spending during industry downturns and historically have lowered their spending more than the decline in their revenues 
as a result  if we are unable to control our expenses adequately in response to lower revenues from our licensees and service customers  our operating results will suffer and we might experience operating losses 
the international nature of our business exposes us to financial and regulatory risks and we may have difficulty protecting our intellectual property in some foreign countries 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licensees headquartered outside the united states  principally in asia  and these revenues accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal international operations are subject to a number of risks  including the following international terrorism and anti american sentiment  particularly in the emerging markets  laws and business practices favoring local companies  withholding tax obligations on license revenues that we may not be able to offset fully against our us tax obligations  including the further risk that foreign tax authorities may re characterize license fees or increase tax rates  which could result in increased tax withholdings and penalties  and less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the united states or other developed countries 
our intellectual property is also used in a large number of foreign countries 
there are many countries  such as china  in which we currently have no issued patents 
in addition  effective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
it may be difficult for us to protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries 
we expect this to become a greater problem for us as our licensees increase their manufacturing in countries which provide less protection for intellectual property 
our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business 
our services business may subject us to specific costs and risks that we may fail to manage adequately which could harm our business 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from engineering services 
among the engineering services that we offer are customized package design and prototyping  modeling  simulation  failure analysis and reliability testing and related training services 
a number of factors  including  among others  the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio  our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts  could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline  which would in turn harm our operating results 
moreover  most of our service revenues are derived from engineering services we provide to government agencies and their contractors to enable the development of new packaging technologies 
if demand for our services from government agencies declines  due to changes in government policies or otherwise  our service revenues will be adversely affected 

table of contents under our services contracts we are required to perform certain services  including sometimes delivering designs and prototypes 
if we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts  we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract 
we provide certain other services at below cost in an effort to increase the speed and breadth with which the semiconductor industry adopts our technologies 
for example  we provide modeling  manufacturing process training  equipment and materials characterization and other services to assist licensees in designing  implementing  upgrading and maintaining their packaging assembly line 
we frequently provide these services as a form of training to introduce new licensees to our technology and existing clients to new technologies  with the aim that these services will help us to generate revenues in the future 
we need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues 
our failure to monitor these services or our design and prototype services adequately may harm our operating results 
because our services sometimes involve the delivery of package designs and prototypes  we may be subject to claims that we infringed or induced the infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights belonging to others 
if such a claim were made  we may have to take a license or stop manufacturing the offending packages  which could cause our services revenues to decrease 
if we choose not to take a license  we may be sued for infringement  and may incur significant litigation costs in defending against the lawsuit 
if we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we may have to pay damages and could be subject to an injunction preventing us from continuing to provide the services 
any of these outcomes could harm our business 
if our prototypes  manufactured packages or products based on our designs are used in defective products  we may be subject to product liability or other claims 
under our service contracts  we may  at times  manufacture packages on a limited basis  deliver prototypes or design or help design prototypes or products 
if these prototypes  manufactured packages or designs are used in defective or malfunctioning products  we could be sued for damages  especially if the defect or malfunction causes physical harm to people 
the occurrence of a problem could result in product liability claims and or a recall of  or safety alert or advisory notice relating to  the product 
while we believe the amount of product liability insurance maintained by us combined with the indemnities that we have been granted under these service contracts are adequate  there can be no assurance that these will be adequate to satisfy claims made against us in the future or that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
product liability claims or product recalls in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and reputation  and on our ability to attract and retain licensees and customers 
we intend to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 
we plan to expand our operations  domestically and internationally  and may do so through both internal growth and acquisitions 
we expect that this expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls 
in addition  we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls 
if we do fail to do so  our growth would be limited 
our officers have limited experience in managing large or rapidly growing businesses 
further  our officers have limited experience managing companies through acquisitions and technological changes 
in addition  our management has limited experience in managing a public company 
we may make acquisitions  which could divert management s attention  cause ownership dilution to our stockholders  be difficult to integrate and adversely affect our financial results 
while we have not acquired any significant businesses  products or technologies in the past  acquisitions are commonplace in the semiconductor industry and we may acquire complementary businesses or technologies in 
table of contents the future 
integrating newly acquired businesses or technologies could put a strain on our resources  could be costly and time consuming  and might not be successful 
future acquisitions could divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
in addition  we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations 
future acquisitions could also result in customer dissatisfaction  performance problems with an acquired company or technology  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  the assumption or incurrence of contingent liabilities  possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances  any of which could harm our business 
consequently  we might not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses  products or technologies  and might not achieve anticipated revenues and cost benefits 
if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
our success depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  legal and finance personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace 
in particular  the services of dr 
mcwilliams  our president  chief executive officer and the chairman of our board of directors  who has led our company since may and been chairman since february  are very important to our business 
none of our senior management  key technical personnel or key sales personnel are bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our key personnel 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 
our success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  legal and finance personnel and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively  both individually and as a group 
competition for qualified senior employees can be intense 
for example  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth and expansion 
further  we must train our new personnel  especially our technical support personnel  to respond to and support our licensees and customers 
if we fail to do this  it could lead to dissatisfaction among our licensees or customers  which could slow our growth or result in a loss of business 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
we use hazardous substances in the manufacturing and testing of prototype products and in the development of our technologies in our research and development laboratories 
we are subject to a variety of local  state  federal and foreign governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances 
our past  present or future failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
compliance with such regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other substantial expenses 
any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous or toxic substances  could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statues 
the imposition of such liabilities could significantly harm our business 
our operations are primarily located in california and  as a result  are subject to catastrophes 
our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities  computer systems and personnel  which are primarily located in or near our principal headquarters in san jose  california 
san jose exists on or near a known earthquake fault zone 
should an earthquake or other catastrophes  such as fires  floods  power loss  communication failure or similar events disable our facilities  we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business 

table of contents compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are often subject to varying interpretations 
as a result  their application in practice may evolve as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
as a result of our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  we have increased and will likely continue to increase general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  director and officer liability insurance has become more expensive and we have purchased reduced coverage as compared to previous years 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
some of the securities that we may invest in the future may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we plan to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  which may include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
currently  we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows
