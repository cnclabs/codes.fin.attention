item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview over the past few years the residential wood furniture industry has experienced a surge in low cost imported products  primarily from china 
imports have grown dramatically in the past few years and according to industry sources it is estimated that imports now account for over half of all residential wood furniture sold in the united states 
in response to this trend we developed a blended strategy of combining our domestic manufacturing capabilities with an offshore sourcing program and realigned our manufacturing capacity 
we incorporate selected imported component parts and finished items in our product line to lower costs  provide design flexibility  and offer a better value to our customers 
sourced products increased to approximately of our sales in compared to in we anticipate this percentage to remain about the same in the increase in offshore sourcing created excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities which caused us to reduce and realign manufacturing capacity 
we closed a manufacturing facility in our former west end  north carolina factory and reduced operations at another manufacturing facility in we have realigned production so that each of our current manufacturing facilities is focused on specific product lines of compatible products to improve quality and lower production costs 
these actions reduced our manufacturing capacity by approximately to 
we operated at approximately to of this reduced capacity in compared to to in  resulting in improved operating margins in we are maintaining our manufacturing capacity at this level to provide protective capacity for improved demand 
we will continue to evaluate our manufacturing capacity needs considering offshore sourcing opportunities  current and anticipated demand for our products  overall market conditions and other factors we consider relevant 
should further capacity reductions become necessary  this could cause asset impairment or other restructuring charges in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  net sales cost of sales restructuring and related charges gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income  net 

interest expense 
income before income taxes income taxes net income compared to net sales increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to higher unit volume and to a lesser extent higher average selling prices 
while industry sales trends improved in  we believe most of our growth came from market share gains 
gross profit margin for increased to from in higher gross profit margin in was primarily due to higher production levels at our domestic facilities and savings from sourcing initiatives 
inflation in raw materials  wages  employee benefits  energy costs and tariffs imposed on wooden bedroom furniture imported from china were offset with modest price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were for both and selling  general and administrative expenditures increased in by million 
this increase resulted from higher selling expenses directly attributable to the increase in sales including additional warehouse expense  increased bonus expense due to higher earnings and cost incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of these increases were partially offset by a  net reversal of bad debt expense in due to a reduction in accounts receivable from certain customers experiencing financial difficulties compared to a net reversal of  in as a result of the above  operating income as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for interest expense for decreased primarily due to lower average debt levels 
the effective tax rate for is which is comparable to the effective tax rate 
as a result of the new american jobs creation act of which allows for a deduction based on qualified domestic production activities  we expect a modest decline in our effective tax rate as this deduction is phased in over the next six years 
consequently  the effective tax rate is expected to range from to 
compared to net sales increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to higher unit volume 
we believe this higher unit volume was due to gains in market share resulting from our blended operating strategy that allowed us to offer improved product styling and value to our customers 
while industry sales trends improved in the second half of  the industry reported a sales decrease in gross profit margin for increased to from in lower gross profit margin in was due primarily to restructuring and related charges resulting from closing a factory to reduce our manufacturing capacity 
the gross profit margin for increased due to savings from sourcing initiatives and the realignment of manufacturing capacity 
these savings were mostly offset by transition and start up costs from increased offshore sourcing  lower production levels at our manufacturing facilities and other inflationary costs including wages and employee benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was for both and selling  general and administrative expenditures increased million in due primarily to higher sales  expansion of our offshore sourcing program and increased marketing and product development costs 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in bad debt expense 
we recognized  of bad debt expense in compared to a net reversal of  in due to a decrease in accounts receivable from certain customers experiencing financial difficulties 
as a result of the above  operating income for increased to million  or as a percentage of net sales  from million  or as a percentage of net sales  in interest expense for decreased due primarily to lower average debt levels 
our effective income tax rate for increased to from in  due primarily to higher state income taxes resulting from the phase out of certain state tax credits 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity include cash on hand  cash from operations and amounts available under a million credit facility 
these sources have been adequate for day to day expenditures  debt payments  purchases of our stock  capital expenditures and payment of cash dividends to stockholders 
we expect these sources of liquidity to continue to be adequate for the future 
working capital has increased to support increased sales and due to higher finished goods inventory levels as the proportion of our sales from sourced products has increased 
to support our delivery performance  we maintain a higher inventory level of sourced products compared to those we manufacture 
we expect future changes in working capital to be more closely aligned with changes in sales 
at december   approximately million remains authorized by our board of directors to repurchase shares of our common stock 
consequently  we may  from time to time  either directly or through agents  repurchase our common stock in the open market  through negotiated purchases or otherwise  at prices and on terms satisfactory to us 
depending on market prices and other relevant conditions  such purchases may be discontinued at any time 
the board of directors initiated an annual dividend policy of 
per share in january and doubled the dividend to 
per share in january and increased it another to 
per share in february the aggregate payments for are expected to be approximately million 
cash generated from operations was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in compared to was due to higher payments to suppliers and employees  partially offset by higher receipts from customers 
payments to suppliers and employees increased million  primarily to fund increased purchases of sourced products  higher production and higher selling and administrative expenses 
cash received from customers increased million as a result of higher sales 
the decrease in cash generated from operations for compared to was due primarily to higher tax payments which was a result of timing of estimated tax payments and higher income 
net cash used by investing activities was million in compared to million and  in and  respectively 
capital expenditures in consisted of normal capital expenditures and software purchases 
the expenditures for all three years were primarily for plant and equipment and other assets in the normal course of business 
in  we received net proceeds of  from the sale of real estate at our former west end  north carolina facility 
the decline in capital expenditures for the past years is due to the relocation of a significant portion of the machinery and equipment from our former west end  north carolina facility to other company facilities and used in lieu of normal replacements 
in  we expect to see the return to more historic levels of capital spending 
consequently  capital expenditures for are anticipated to range from million to million 
our sales growth  along with an increase in the proportion of sourced goods  has created a need for additional warehouse space 
we are currently renting space to accommodate our needs 
to partially address the need for additional warehouse space  approximately  of the capital expenditures will be used to expand warehouse space and improve the manufacturing flow at one of our facilities 
however  since this will not completely alleviate the need for rented warehouse space  we continue to evaluate long term solutions which could result in additional capital expenditures in net cash used by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in cash from operations and proceeds from exercise of stock options provided funds for senior debt payments and cash dividends 
in and  cash from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided cash for purchase and retirement of our common stock and senior debt payments 
in  these funds were also used to pay cash dividends 
at december   long term debt including current maturities was million 
debt service requirements are million in  million both in and and million in both and as of december   approximately million of additional borrowings were available under a revolving credit facility and cash on hand was million 
the following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payment due or commitment expiration less than over total year years years years contractual cash obligations long term debt      operating leases   total contractual cash obligations      other commercial commitments letters of credit   critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that are necessary to accurately and fairly report our operational and financial position 
below are the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of trade customers to make required payments 
we provide an allowance for specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful and also provide an allowance for other accounts based on historical collection and write off experience 
judgment is critical because some customers have experienced financial difficulties 
as the financial condition of these customers and the related receivable balances change  the level of such allowances will be reevaluated 
during  the credit exposure related to certain customer accounts experiencing financial difficulties declined resulting in a decrease in the allowance for doubtful receivables 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost for all inventories is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventory to determine excess or slow moving items based on current order activity and projections of future demand 
for those items identified  we estimate our market value or net sales value based on current trends 
those items having a net sales value less than cost are written down to their net sales value 
this process recognizes projected inventory losses when they become evident rather than at the time they are sold 
these reserves were increased in as a result of higher inventory levels 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment when events indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
depreciation policy reflects judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying applications of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our tax contingencies contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
pension costs our pension expense is developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefit payments and expected return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the key assumptions used in developing net pension costs were a discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of compared to for both the discount rate and expected return on plan assets in in establishing our expected return on plan assets assumption  we review asset allocation considering plan maturity and develop return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses 
actual asset over under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease increase unrecognized loss 
the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods 
a one percentage point change in the expected return assumption in the current year would have resulted in a change in pension expense of  net pension cost for is expected to increase slightly  primarily as a result of a reduction in the discount rate from to 
self insurance we are self insured for certain claims related to medical insurance and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is established based upon analysis of historical data and is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
if actual claims differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
tariffs imposed on wooden bedroom furniture imported from china tariff expense is based on the most current rates published by the department of commerce 
these rates are potentially subject to an administrative review process starting approximately one year after the publication date 
the final amounts will depend on whether administrative reviews are performed and the outcome of those reviews  if any  on the vendors we purchase from 
we do not have transactions or relationships with special purpose entities  and we do not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases primarily for showroom  warehousing space and certain technology equipment 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
statement no 
r will require the fair value of all stock option awards issued to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period 
the statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
we are evaluating these new rules  but expect no material impact upon adoption relating to outstanding options since a majority of the awards under the existing incentive stock option plan will be fully vested prior to the effective date of the revised rules 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our obligation under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  therefore  changes in prevailing interest rates impact our borrowing costs 
a one percentage point fluctuation in market interest rates would not have had a material impact on earnings in
