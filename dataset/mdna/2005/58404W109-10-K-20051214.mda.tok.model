item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare provider focused primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we own and operate hospitals in partnership with physicians whom we believe have established reputations for clinical excellence as well as with community hospital systems 
we opened our first hospital in and currently have ownership interest in and operate twelve hospitals 
we have majority ownership of eleven of these hospitals and a minority interest in one 
each of our majority owned hospitals is a freestanding  licensed general acute care hospital that provides a wide range of health services  and the medical staff at each of our hospitals includes qualified physicians in various specialties 
our hospitals have a total of licensed beds and are located in eight states arizona  arkansas  california  louisiana  new mexico  ohio  south dakota  and texas 
in addition to our hospitals  we own and or manage cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities 
we began our cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic business in we currently own and or manage twenty seven cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities 
eleven of these facilities are located at hospitals operated by other parties and offer invasive diagnostic and  in some cases  therapeutic procedures 
the remaining sixteen facilities are not located at hospitals and offer only diagnostic procedures 
basis of consolidation 
we have included in our consolidated financial statements hospitals and cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities over which we exercise substantive control  including all entities in which we own more than a interest  as well as variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we have used the equity method of accounting for entities  including variable interest entities  in which we hold less than a interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control  and are not the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  the one hospital in which we hold a minority interest  avera heart hospital of south dakota  is excluded from the net revenue and operating expenses of our consolidated company and our consolidated hospital division 
similarly  a number of our diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are excluded from the net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated diagnostics division 
our minority interest in the results of operations for the periods discussed for these entities is recognized as part of the equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in our statements of operations in accordance with the equity method of accounting 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we closed the heart hospital of milwaukee and sold substantially all of the hospital s assets 
accordingly  for all fiscal years presented  the results of operations and the related gain 
table of contents on the sale of the assets have been excluded from continuing operations and instead are reported in income loss from discontinued operations 
same facility hospitals 
our policy is to include in our same facility basis only those facilities that were open and operational during the full current and prior fiscal year comparable periods 
for example  on a same facility basis for our consolidated hospital division for the fiscal year ended september   we exclude the results of operations of our two newest hospitals  texsan heart hospital and heart hospital of lafayette  which opened in january and march  respectively 
revenue sources by division 
the largest percentage of our net revenue is attributable to our hospital division 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each of our consolidating divisions to consolidated net revenue in the periods indicated below 
year ended september  division hospital diagnostics corporate and other net revenue revenue sources by payor 
we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations  and our patients directly 
generally  our net revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payor mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
since cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects those age and older  the proportion of net revenue we derive from the medicare program is higher than that of most general acute care hospitals 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenue we earned by category of payor in each of our last three fiscal years 
year ended september  payor medicare medicaid commercial and other  including self pay total consolidated net revenue we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies  such as fee for service charges and rates based on diagnosis related groups 
we limit the number of per diem contracts we accept from managed care organizations because we believe these contracts do not reimburse us sufficiently for the efficiencies that we achieve in our hospitals 
we do not accept capitation contracts from any payors 
a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from federal and state governmental healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid and we expect the net revenue that we receive from the medicare program as a percentage of total consolidated net revenue will remain significant in future periods 
our payor mix may fluctuate in future periods due to changes in reimbursement  market and industry trends with self pay patients and other similar factors 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  court decisions  executive orders and freezes and funding reductions  all of which may significantly affect our business 
in addition  reimbursement is generally subject to adjustment following audit by third party payors  including the fiscal intermediaries who administer the medicare program for cms 
final determination of amounts due providers under the medicare program often takes several years because of such audits  as well as resulting provider appeals and the application of technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might result from these programs  however  due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid 
table of contents programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
see business reimbursement and regulation 
we do not expect changes in either the outlier formula or the drg classification will have a material effect on our payments in fiscal however  we do expect that the combined changes in fiscal will increase our net revenue by approximately million 
because the regulations are subject to change  and due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating the impact of these announced changes on our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that our estimates will change by a material amount in the near future 
medicare reimburses hospitals for capital related costs using one of two alternative methodologies based upon whether the hospital is categorized as new under the regulations of cms 
on august   one of the company s medicare fiscal intermediaries notified the company that it had been directed by cms to change  on a retroactive and prospective basis  the capital cost reimbursement methodology applicable to four of its hospitals 
during february  we learned that cms had determined that the change in capital reimbursement methodology would be effective august   and that the change would not be applied retroactively to any periods prior to that effective date 
the impact of this change for fiscal was a million reduction in our net revenue and for fiscal was a million reduction in our net revenue from the amount that would have been recognized under the previous reimbursement method 
we believe the impact of this change in methodology will diminish rapidly in future years  based on how reimbursement is calculated  and we estimate that the cumulative negative impact for fiscal years through will be approximately to million 
moratorium 
through june   the medicare modernization act prohibited reliance upon the whole hospital exception by new specialty hospitals  as defined by the medicare modernization act  and imposed limitations on the activities of specialty hospitals in operation or under development as of november  while this provision of the medicare modernization act has lapsed  certain legislation is pending that would extend its provisions 
we cannot predict the long term impact of this or other proposed legislation on our business given the uncertainty involved with regulatory changes 
see business regulation fraud and abuse laws physician self referral law 
other 
on december   one of our facilities incurred physical damage due to a minor fire 
water damage was incurred in several areas of the hospital including two of the hospitals catheterization laboratories  as well as two of its operating rooms 
as a result  the hospital has temporarily suspended performing most patient procedures and has closed its emergency department until the full effects of the damage can be assessed 
we are working with our insurance carrier to assess the monetary losses that resulted from the fire  and are determining when we will be able to resume full patient services at the hospital 
critical accounting policies general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes as experience develops or new information becomes known 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine and have the potential to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting 
table of contents policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid and other third party payors such as commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations are generally less than our established billing rates 
payment arrangements with third party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge or per visit  a discount from established charges  per diem payments  reimbursed costs subject to limits and or other similar contractual arrangements 
as a result  net revenue for services rendered to patients is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts as services are rendered 
we account for the difference between the estimated realizable rates under the reimbursement program and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments 
the majority of our contractual adjustments are system generated at the time of billing based on either government fee schedules or fee schedules contained in our managed care agreements with various insurance plans 
portions of our contractual adjustments are performed manually and these adjustments primarily relate to patients that have insurance plans with whom our hospitals do not have contracts containing discounted fee schedules  also referred to as non contracted payors  patients that have secondary insurance plans following adjudication by the primary payor  uninsured self pay patients and charity care patients 
estimates of contractual adjustments are made on a payor specific basis and based on the best information available regarding our interpretation of the applicable laws  regulations and contract terms 
while subsequent adjustments to the systematic contractual allowances can arise due to denials  short payments deemed immaterial for continued collection effort and a variety of other reasons  such amounts have not historically been significant 
we continually review the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to the laws and regulations and any changes in the contractual terms of our programs 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties  which can take several years to determine 
from a procedural standpoint  for government payors  primarily medicare  we recognize estimated settlements in our consolidated financial statements based on filed cost reports 
we subsequently adjust those settlements as we obtain new information from audits or reviews by the fiscal intermediary and  if the result of the fiscal intermediary audit or review impacts other unsettled and open cost reports  then we recognize the impact of those adjustments 
we estimate current year settlements based on models designed to approximate our cost report filings and revise our estimates in february of each year upon completion of the actual cost report and tentative settlement 
due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted  and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
we provide care to patients who meet certain criteria under our charity care policy without charge or at amounts less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported as net revenue 
our managed diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories operate under various contracts where management fee revenue is recognized under fixed rate and percentage of income arrangements as services are rendered 
in addition  certain diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories recognize additional revenue under cost reimbursement and equipment lease arrangements 
net revenue from our owned diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from patients  third party payors  and others as services are rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients in our hospital division 
the remainder of our accounts receivable principally consist of amounts due from billings to hospitals for various cardiovascular care services performed in our diagnostics division and amounts due under consulting and management contracts 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on such factors 
table of contents as payor mix  aging and the historical collection experience and write offs of our respective hospitals and other business units 
adverse changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care reimbursement could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
when possible  we will attempt to collect co payments from patients prior to admission for inpatient services as a part of the pre registration and registration processes 
if unsuccessful  we will also attempt to reach a mutually agreed upon payment arrangement at that time 
to the extent possible  the estimated amount of the patient s financial responsibility is determined based on the services to be performed  the patient s applicable co payment amount percentage and any identified remaining deductible and co insurance percentages 
if payment arrangements are not provided upon admission or only a partial payment is obtained  we will attempt to collect any estimated remaining patient balance upon discharge 
we also comply with the requirements under applicable law concerning collection of medicare co payments and deductibles 
patients who come to our hospitals for outpatient services are expected to make payment or adequate financial arrangements before receiving services 
patients who come to the emergency room are screened and stabilized to the extent of the hospital s capability for any emergency medical condition in accordance with applicable laws  rules and other regulations in order that financial arrangements do not delay such screening  stabilization  and appropriate disposition 
general and professional liability risk 
from june through june  we were partially self insured under a claims made policy providing coverage for claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim 
effective june  we entered into a new one year claims made policy providing coverage for claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim  subject to an additional amount of retained liability of million per claim and million in the aggregate for claims reported during the policy year at one of its hospitals 
in june  we entered into a new one year claims made policy providing coverage at the same amounts as were in effect during the policy year 
in june  we entered into a one year claims made policy providing coverage for medical malpractice claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim 
we also purchased additional insurance to reduce the retained liability per claim to  for the diagnostics division 
because of our self insured retention levels  we are required to recognize an estimated expense liability for the amount of our retained liability applicable to each malpractice claim 
as of september  and september   the total estimated liability for our self insured retention on medical malpractice claims  including an estimated amount for incurred but not reported claims  was approximately million and million  respectively  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we maintain this reserve based on actuarial estimates prepared by an independent third party  who bases the estimates on our historical experience with claims and assumptions about future events 
in addition to reserves for medical malpractice  we also maintain reserves for our self insured healthcare and dental coverage provided to our employees 
as of september  and september   our total estimated reserve for self insured liabilities on employee health and dental claims was million and million  respectively  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we maintain this reserve based on our historical experience with claims 
we also maintain commercial stop loss coverage for our health and dental insurance program of  per plan participant 
we continually review our estimates for self insured liabilities and record adjustments as experience develops or new information becomes known 
the changes to the estimated liabilities are included in current operating results 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  including such factors as changes in medical costs and changes in actual experience  there is a reasonable possibility that the recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
also  there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets of businesses purchased 
other intangible assets primarily consist of the value of management contracts 
with the exception of goodwill  intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we evaluate goodwill annually on september for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to 
table of contents determine the value of our reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
in september  we performed a goodwill impairment test  the results of which concluded our goodwill was impaired 
based on the hypothetical purchase price methodology required under sfas no 
 we determined the amount of the goodwill impairment to be approximately million at september  the million impairment charge consisted of million related to our hospital division reporting unit  which reduced its remaining goodwill to million  including million allocated to discontinued operations at september   and million related to our diagnostics division reporting unit  which reduced its remaining goodwill to at september  the testing performed in september and indicated that no additional impairment was required in fiscal and  respectively 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows as an estimate of fair value 
the determination of whether or not long lived assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of those assets 
changes in our strategy  assumptions and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long lived assets 
during the year ended september   we recorded a million impairment charge  which was comprised of million relating to license fees associated with the use of certain accounting software and million relating to a management contract 
the accounting software is currently installed in two hospitals and was intended to be installed in the remaining hospitals  however  due to the lack of additional benefits provided by the system and additional installation costs required  we determined that the system would not be installed in any additional hospitals 
therefore  the impairment charge reflects the unused license fees associated with this system 
the remaining million impairment charge relates to the excess carrying value over the fair value of a management contract due to lack of volumes and other economic factors at one of our managed diagnostic ventures 
during the year ended september   the operating performance of one of our facilities  louisiana heart hospital  was significantly below prior year results and below our expectations 
as a result  various strategic initiatives were undertaken to help improve operations and strengthen the hospital s financial position  however  in september  hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast region and the area around louisiana heart hospital was significantly impacted 
while the facility only sustained minor structural damage  the long term operational impact of the storm cannot be determined 
while the strategic initiatives have been delayed or postponed  population shifts and other factors in the surrounding region  including new orleans  could have either a positive or negative impact on the future operations 
as such  while no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended september   a future write off may be necessary if  as business circumstances become clearer  it becomes evident that the carrying amount of the hospital s assets are not fully recoverable during the year ended september   we recorded a million impairment charge relating to certain software costs associated with the purchase of an enterprise wide healthcare information system  which had been installed in two of our hospitals 
due to a number of functionality and integration issues experienced with this system  we determined that the system is not performing to its original specifications and thus will be replaced at the two hospitals where it has been installed and will not be installed in any additional hospitals as stated in the original license 
the impairment charge reflects unamortized costs associated with the acquisition  development and implementation of the system 
earnings allocated to minority interests 
earnings allocated to minority interests represent the allocation of profits and losses to minority owners in our consolidated subsidiaries 
because our hospitals are owned as joint ventures  each hospital s earnings and losses are generally allocated for accounting purposes to us and our physician and community hospital partners on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective ownership percentages in the hospital 
if  however  the cumulative net losses of a hospital exceed its initial capitalization and 
table of contents committed capital obligations of our partners  then we are required  due to the respective at risk capital positions  by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to recognize a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s losses  instead of the smaller pro rata share of the losses that normally would be allocated to us based upon our percentage ownership 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s losses would reduce our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
when the same hospital has earnings in a subsequent period  a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s earnings will be allocated to us to the extent we have previously recognized a disproportionate share of that hospital s losses 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s earnings would increase our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
the determination of at risk capital position is based on the specific terms of each hospital s operating agreement  including each partner s contributed capital  obligation to contribute additional capital to provide working capital loans  or to guarantee the outstanding obligations of the hospital 
during each of our fiscal years  and  our disproportionate recognition of earnings and losses in our hospitals had a net negative impact of million  million  and million  respectively  on our reported income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations 
we expect our earnings allocated to minority interests to fluctuate in future periods as we either recognize disproportionate losses and or recoveries thereof through disproportionate profits of our hospitals 
as of september   we had remaining cumulative disproportionate loss allocations of approximately million that we may recover in future periods  or be required to recognize additional disproportionate losses  depending on the results of operations of each of our hospitals 
we could also be required to recognize disproportionate losses at our other hospitals not currently in disproportionate allocation depending on their results of operations in future periods 
income taxes 
income taxes are computed on the pretax income loss based on current tax law 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or their future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year statement of operations data 
the following table presents our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue year ended september  of net increase decrease revenue net revenue operating expenses personnel expense medical supplies expense bad debt expense other operating expenses pre opening expenses depreciation amortization gain loss on disposal of property  equipment and other assets impairments of long lived assets income from operations other income expenses interest expense interest income and other income  net loss on debt refinancing equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates income from continuing operations before minority interest  income taxes and discontinued operations minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries income from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations income tax expense income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income loss net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  of this million increase in net revenue  our hospital division generated an million increase and our diagnostic division generated a million increase  both of which were partially offset by a million decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
the million increase in hospital division net revenue was attributable to million of net revenue growth from our two newest hospitals  including texsan heart hospital which opened january   and heart hospital of lafayette which opened march   with the remainder of the growth being primarily attributable to our same facility hospitals 
on a consolidated basis  hospital admissions increased and adjusted admissions increased for fiscal compared to fiscal also on a consolidated basis  
table of contents inpatient catheterization procedures increased and inpatient surgical procedures increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  while average length increased slightly from days for fiscal to days for fiscal the million increase in net revenue contributed by our same facility hospitals  along with the increases in admissions of  adjusted admissions of  inpatient catheterization procedures of  and inpatient surgical procedures of within our same facility hospitals was largely due to the growth in operations at the majority of our facilities  partially offset by decline in net revenue year over year at two hospitals  including louisiana heart hospital 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we filed medicare cost reports for fiscal year and as a result of changes in our estimates of final settlements based on additional information  we recognized contractual allowance adjustments that increased net revenue by approximately million 
similarly  during the second quarter of fiscal we filed medicare cost reports for fiscal year and recognized adjustments that increased net revenue by approximately million 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized approximately million of contractual allowance adjustments that increased net revenue as a result of our calculation of amounts owed to us by medicare under disproportionate share hospital dsh provisions for fiscal and fiscal based on rates that are not published by medicare until the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
dsh amounts are provided to facilities that have a high proportion of medicaid payors and the calculation of the amounts owed is based on formulas that incorporate the number of medicaid days among other factors 
similarly  we recognized million in the fourth quarter fiscal for amounts owed under the dsh provisions for fiscal the million decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations net revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a change in certain vendor relationships associated with a physician management contract in the first quarter of to eliminate a substantial amount of pass through cost reimbursement revenue 
the cost reimbursement changes under this contract reduced both our net revenue and certain of our operating expenses by corresponding amounts  and therefore had no impact on our consolidated income from operations or our consolidated net income during fiscal personnel expense 
personnel expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased slightly to from for the comparable periods 
the million increase in personnel expense was principally incurred in the hospital division  with our two newest hospitals comprising million of the increase and same facility hospitals accounting for an additional million increase 
the growth in personnel expense at our same facility hospitals was primarily attributable to the additional staffing to support the increase in admissions and surgical procedures in fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as cost of living adjustments given to employees during the first quarter of fiscal on an adjusted patient day basis  personnel expense increased marginally for the hospital division to  per adjusted patient day for fiscal compared to  per adjusted patient day for fiscal personnel expense includes million of non cash share based compensation in fiscal related to the accelerated vesting during the fourth quarter of substantially all stock options previously awarded to employees 
the compensation cost represents the intrinsic value measured at the acceleration date  september   for the estimated number of awards that  absent the acceleration  would have expired unexercisable 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting of these options is to eliminate compensation expense of approximately million that we would otherwise recognize in future periods with respect to these options upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r will generally require that all share based payments to employees  including the vesting of stock option awards  be recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r became effective for us on october  this cost was partially offset by a net decrease in personnel costs associated with our diagnostics division and cardiology consulting and management operations 
medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in medical supplies expense was primarily incurred in the hospital division  with our two newest hospitals and our same facility hospitals accounting for 
table of contents million and million of the increase  respectively 
the increase in our same facility hospitals medical supplies expense was attributable to the increases in catheterization and surgical procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal moreover  the increase in surgical procedures during was disproportionately comprised of cardiac procedures that use high cost medical devices and supplies  such as automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators aicd  pacemaker procedures  and drug eluting stents 
during fiscal  we experienced a increase in the number of aicd procedures compared to fiscal we have experienced a general trend over the past two years in which the number of surgical procedures involving aicd and other higher cost medical devices and supplies has increased as a component of our mix of procedures 
in addition  the increased usage of drug eluting stents contributed to higher medical supplies expense during fiscal compared to fiscal approximately of our cardiac procedures involving stents utilized drug eluting stents compared to for fiscal further  our average utilization rate for drug eluting stents was stents per case during fiscal as compared to stents per case during fiscal additionally  vascular procedures increased year over year 
the increase in vascular related supply expense has been a trend over the last several months of fiscal clinically  peripheral vascular procedures treat disease of blood vessels outside the heart  primarily the narrowing of vessels that carry blood to the legs  arms  stomach or kidneys 
catheterization lab treatment includes angioplasty and stenting 
carotid stenting procedures also have increased in volume due to improvements in stents that reduce the incidence of stroke 
hospital division medical supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal and overall medical supplies expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal  reflecting the increase in procedures that use high costs devices and drug eluting stents 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in bad debt expense was primarily incurred by our two newest hospitals  which accounted for million of the increase 
the million increase in our same facility hospitals bad debt expense was primarily attributable to growth in net revenue  as previously discussed  and an increase in the number of self pay patients in several of our markets in fiscal self pay patients represented of hospital division revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in other operating expenses was due to overall increases in the hospital  diagnostic and corporate and other divisions of million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in the hospital division was primarily due to costs associated with the two new hospitals 
the million increase in the diagnostics division other operating expenses period to period was due to the businesses developed and opened since the beginning of fiscal the increase in the corporate and other division other operating expenses was principally due to million of consulting and other expenses incurred to support our effort to ensure compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  we incurred certain incremental legal fees associated with a specific lawsuit and we also incurred fees related to the recruitment and relocation of certain senior management personnel 
as a percentage of revenue  other operating expenses decreased to from for the year ended september  and  respectively 
pre opening expenses 
there were no pre opening expenses incurred fiscal versus million that was incurred for the fiscal pre opening expenses represent costs specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
upon opening heart hospital of lafayette during the second quarter of fiscal  we have completed our hospital expansion plans that commenced in following completion of our initial public offering  and we do not currently have any other hospitals under development 
accordingly  we are no longer incurring pre opening expenses 
the amount of pre opening expenses  if any  we incur in future periods will depend on the nature  timing and size of our development activities 
depreciation 
depreciation decreased to million for the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september  this million decrease is the net result of equipment within the hospital division becoming fully depreciated during fiscal or 
table of contents impairments of long lived assets 
impairments were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million in fiscal impairment represents management s decision to discontinue implementation of certain accounting software  as well as the determination that the carrying value of a management contract in the diagnostics division exceeded its fair value 
the million impairment in represents the write off of an enterprise wide healthcare information system 
see critical accounting policies long lived assets 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this million increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the increase in our overall cost of borrowings on debt compared to the debt that was repaid as a result of the refinancing transaction completed in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  our average outstanding debt was higher during the comparable periods 
further  we capitalized approximately million of interest expense as part of the capitalized construction costs of our hospitals that were still under development during the first part of fiscal as of september   approximately of our outstanding debt bears interest on variable rates 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this million increase is due to interest earned on available cash and cash equivalents as our cash position has increased by approximately million year over year 
loss on debt refinancing 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repaid approximately million of existing debt with proceeds received from our offering of million senior notes and a million senior credit facility 
the repayment of debt resulted in a loss of approximately million 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to changes in the operating results of our individual hospitals and the respective basis for allocating such earnings or losses among us and our partners on either a pro rata basis or disproportionate basis during fiscal compared to fiscal our earnings allocated to minority interests increased partially due to an increase in earnings of certain of our same facility hospitals which were allocated to our minority partners on a pro rata basis 
in addition  during a portion of fiscal  we shared losses at our two newest hospitals with our minority partners on a pro rata basis  however  during the same period in fiscal  we were required by generally accepted accounting principles to recognize  for accounting purposes  a disproportionate of the hospitals losses such that no amounts were allocated to our minority partners 
however  this provision does not relieve our minority investors from any of their obligations to make additional capital contributions if one of our hospitals requires additional cash to fund its operations 
for a more complete discussion of our accounting for minority interests  including the basis for the disproportionate allocation accounting  see critical accounting policies earnings allocated to minority interests 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  which represented an effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively 
the overall decrease in the effective rate represents the lower impact of certain non deductible expenses period to period on overall taxable income 
the company continues to have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards available from prior periods to offset the majority of its current tax liabilities 
income loss from discontinued operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we closed and sold substantially all of the assets of the heart hospital of milwaukee 
accordingly  the hospital is accounted for as discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations in the fiscal reflects the gain on the sale of the assets of approximately million  partially offset by operating losses  shut down costs and the overall income tax expense associated with the facility

net revenue increased to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  of this million increase in net revenue  our hospital division generated a million increase  which was partially offset by a million decrease in our diagnostics division and a million decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
the million increase in hospital division net revenue was attributable to million of net revenue growth from our three newest hospitals  including louisiana heart hospital which opened on february  
table of contents texsan heart hospital which opened january   and heart hospital of lafayette which opened march   as well as million of growth among our same facility hospitals 
on a consolidated basis  hospital admissions increased and adjusted admissions increased for fiscal compared to fiscal also on a consolidated basis  inpatient catheterization procedures increased and inpatient surgical procedures increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  while average length of stay decreased to days for fiscal compared to days for fiscal the million increase in net revenue contributed by our same facility hospitals  along with the increases in admissions of  adjusted admissions of  inpatient catheterization procedures of  and inpatient surgical procedures of within our same facility hospitals was largely due to the growth in operations of harlingen medical center and tucson heart hospital as well as the re opening of bakersfield heart hospital s emergency department during the second quarter of fiscal after it was closed in the third quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we filed medicare cost reports for fiscal year and as a result of changes in our estimates of final settlements based on additional information  we recognized contractual allowance adjustments that increased net revenue by approximately million  of which approximately million related to same facility hospitals 
similarly  during the second quarter of fiscal we filed medicare cost reports for fiscal year and recognized adjustments that increased net revenue by approximately million 
the million decrease in our diagnostics division net revenue was the net result of several key changes in this division 
gaston cardiology services llc  which was dissolved in november  contributed incremental revenue of million in as compared to this decline in revenue was partially offset by million in new diagnostic and therapeutic business developed since and a million increase in our same facility diagnostic services 
the increase in same facility diagnostic services was primarily the net result of growth in the number of procedures performed  including new services added  offset in part by a decline in the number of procedures performed in our mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories during fiscal as compared to fiscal the million decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations net revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to two key changes in that business 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we restructured one of our two physician management contracts  which reduced management fee revenue  but more significantly eliminated a pass through cost reimbursement arrangement 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed certain vendor relationships associated with our second physician management contract to eliminate a substantial amount of pass through cost reimbursement revenue 
the cost reimbursement changes under these two contracts reduced both our net revenue and certain of our operating expenses by corresponding amounts  and therefore had no impact on our consolidated income from operations or our consolidated net income during fiscal personnel expense 
personnel expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in personnel expense was primarily due to a million increase generated by our hospital division  offset in part by a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
of the million increase in hospital division personnel expense  our three new hospitals accounted for million and our same facility hospitals accounted for the remaining million 
this increase in our same facility hospitals personnel expense was primarily attributable to increased staffing to support the growth in admissions  inpatient catheterization and surgical procedures during the year 
the million decrease in our corporate and other division s personnel expense was due to the change in the physician management contracts in our cardiology consulting and management operations whereby certain reimbursed costs are no longer being passed through our operations  as previously discussed 
as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense decreased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower same facility hospital personnel costs relative to higher net revenue as compared to prior year  offset by high personnel costs relative to net revenue associated with the ramp up of heart hospital of lafayette and texsan heart hospital 
on an adjusted patient day basis  personnel expense for our consolidated hospitals increased to  per adjusted patient day for fiscal from 
table of contents  per adjusted patient day for fiscal personnel expense on an adjusted patient day basis for our same facility hospitals declined to from  for these comparable periods  which is the result of our concentration on staffing levels  recruiting and retention of nurses in our hospitals  and a decrease in contract labor 
medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in medical supplies expense was due to a million increase in our hospital division and a million increase in our diagnostics division 
of the million increase in our hospital division s medical supplies expense  our three new hospitals accounted for million and our same facility hospitals accounted for the remaining million 
this increase in our same facility hospitals medical supplies expense was attributable to the increases in catheterization and surgical procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal moreover  the increase in surgical procedures during was disproportionately comprised of cardiac procedures that use high cost medical devices and supplies  such as automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators aicd  pacemaker procedures  and drug eluting stents 
during fiscal  we experienced a increase in the number of aicd procedures compared to fiscal we have experienced a general trend over the past year in which the number of surgical procedures involving aicd and other higher cost medical devices and supplies has increased as a component of our mix of procedures 
in addition  the introduction of drug eluting stents in april contributed to higher medical supplies expense during fiscal compared to fiscal approximately of our cardiac procedures involving stents utilized drug eluting stents compared to for fiscal further  our average utilization rate for drug eluting stents in this was stents per case during fiscal as compared to stents per case during fiscal therefore  hospital division medical supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting the increase in procedures that use high costs devices and drug eluting stents 
the million increase in diagnostics division medical supplies expense was primarily attributable to the net growth in its same facility operations  new diagnostic and therapeutic business and the increased costs associated with drug eluting stents during fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  medical supplies expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal bad debt expense 
bad debt expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in bad debt expense was primarily incurred by our same facilities hospitals  which accounted for million of the increase 
our three new hospitals accounted for the remaining million increase for fiscal compared to fiscal the million increase in our same facility hospitals bad debt expense was primarily attributable to growth in net revenue  as previously discussed  and an increase in the number of self pay patients in several of our markets this fiscal year  including the impact of the continued ramp up of harlingen medical center which operates in a market with a historically higher percentage of self pay patients than our other hospitals 
as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in other operating expense was due to a million increase generated by our hospital division  offset in part by a million decrease in our diagnostics division and a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
of the million increase in hospital division other operating expense  our three new hospitals accounted for million and our same facility hospitals accounted for the remaining million 
this increase in our same facility hospitals other operating expense was primarily attributable to the significant growth in volume at two of our hospitals 
these increases in other operating expenses were offset in part by decreases resulting from company wide cost control initiatives 
the million decrease in our diagnostics division was primarily attributable to reduced operating costs resulting from the dissolution of gaston cardiology services  llc  combined with company wide cost control initiatives 
the million decrease in our corporate and other division s other operating expense was primarily due to the change in the physician management contracts in our cardiology consulting and management operations whereby certain reimbursed costs are no longer being passed through our operations  as previously discussed 
as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to higher same facility hospital net revenue and the certain 
table of contents economies of scale achieved on the fixed cost components of our other operating expenses combined with the benefits realized from our company wide cost control initiatives 
depreciation 
depreciation increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase in depreciation primarily occurred in our hospital division and was due to the depreciation of assets placed in service upon the opening of our three new hospitals  offset in part by a decrease related to equipment that became fully depreciated during fiscal in certain of our older same facility hospitals 
impairments of goodwill and long lived assets 
impairments were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million impairment in represents the write off of an enterprise wide healthcare information system  while the million charge in represents goodwill impairment 
the million impairment in represents the unamortized costs associated with the acquisition  development and implementation of an information system that had been installed in two hospitals 
due to a number of functionality and integration issues experienced with the system  we determined that the system was not performing to its original specifications and thus will be replaced at the two hospitals where it has been installed and will not be installed in any additional hospitals as stated in the original license 
at the end of fiscal  we performed a goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that we do not amortize goodwill  but rather subject our goodwill to an impairment test on an annual basis and between annual dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist 
the results of our test concluded our goodwill was impaired  and based on the hypothetical purchase price methodology required under sfas no 
 we determined the amount of the goodwill impairment to be approximately million at september  see critical accounting policies long lived assets 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this million increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to interest expense at our three new hospitals of million  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense in our same facility hospitals due to a decrease in outstanding debt through scheduled principal payments and prepayment reductions 
in addition  we capitalized approximately million and million of interest expense as part of the capitalized construction costs of our hospitals that were under development during fiscal and  respectively 
no interest expense was capitalized during the last two quarters of fiscal loss on debt refinancing 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repaid approximately million of existing debt with proceeds received from our offering of million senior notes and a million senior credit facility 
including the loss on debt refinancing of million which is reported in the loss from discontinued operations  the repayment of debt resulted in a loss of approximately million and included the write off of unamortized loan acquisition costs of approximately million  the recapture of other comprehensive loss under interest rate swaps of approximately million and prepayment penalties of approximately million 
equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates remained consistent at million for fiscal and fiscal however  the equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal includes million associated with a gain on sale of land by an unconsolidated affiliate of one of our hospitals 
excluding this gain  our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased approximately million from the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to a decline in the operating results of our unconsolidated affiliate hospital primarily due to the reduction in that hospital s capital cost reimbursement under the medicare program as the hospital transitioned to the full federal payment methodology following its second full year of operations on october  minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to changes in the operating results of our individual hospitals and the respective basis for allocation of such earnings or losses among us and our partners on either a pro rata basis or disproportionate basis during fiscal compared to fiscal in general  our earnings allocated to minority interests increased due to a decrease in ramp up losses incurred by our new hospitals which were allocated to our minority partners on a pro rata basis combined with an increase in earnings of certain of our same facility 
table of contents hospitals which were allocated to our minority partners on a pro rata basis 
these additions to our earnings allocated to minority interests were increased in part by a change from pro rata to disproportionate recognition of losses at three of our new hospitals that continue to ramp up combined with a change from disproportionate recognition of losses to pro rata recognition of earnings at one of our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to the prior year 
for a more complete discussion of our accounting for minority interests  including the basis for the disproportionate allocation accounting  see critical accounting policies earnings allocated to minority interests 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to income tax expense of million for fiscal  which represented an effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively 
the company continues to have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards available from prior periods to offset the majority of its current tax liabilities 
for fiscal  income taxes include certain one time state incentive credits that we qualified for and were able to utilize 
for fiscal  our reported loss before income taxes and discontinued operations of million included a million impairment of goodwill  which is non deductible on a permanent basis for tax purposes 
loss from discontinued operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we closed and sold substantially all of the assets of the heart hospital of milwaukee  which was opened in october accordingly  the hospital is accounted for as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal represents the operating losses  net of the tax benefit of such losses  of the facility during the period 
the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal represents pre opening operating costs of the facility  net of the tax benefit of such costs 

table of contents selected quarterly results of operations 
the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated operating results for each of our last five quarters 
we have prepared this information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and included all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
these quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
three months ended september  june  march  december  september  statement of operations data net revenue impairments of long lived assets income from operations equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates minority interest income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss cash flow data net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities our results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
cardiovascular procedures can often be scheduled ahead of time  permitting some patients to choose to undergo the procedure at a time and location of their preference 
some of the types of trends that we have experienced in the past and may experience again in the future include the markets where some of our hospitals are located are susceptible to seasonal population changes with part time residents living in the area only during certain months of the year  patients choosing to schedule procedures around significant dates  such as holidays  and physicians in the market where a hospital is located schedule vacation from their practice during the summer months of the year  around holidays and for various professional meetings held throughout the world during the year 
to the extent these types of events occur in the future  as in the past  we expect they will affect the quarterly results of operations of our hospitals 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow activities 
our consolidated working capital was million at september  and million at september  the increase of million in working capital primarily resulted from an increase in cash and cash equivalents combined with a decrease in accounts payable 
table of contents and accrued liabilities  offset in part by an increase in the current portion of long term debt and obligations under capital leases 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents and the decrease in certain liabilities were driven by overall operations  as further described below  and the gross cash received of million as a result of the sale of the heart hospital of milwaukee during the first quarter of fiscal the increase in the current portion of long term debt and obligations under capital leases is due to the company s violation of a certain financial ratio related to an equipment loan at heart hospital of lafayette at september  and the maturity of the mortgage loan at one of our facilities in january therefore  these loans are considered current as of september   whereas the amounts were still considered long term as of september  our cash and cash equivalents at september  includes approximately million that we received in outlier payments in prior years from one of our medicare intermediaries that we may have to repay to the medicare program upon final settlement of cost reports for the periods in question 
cms adopted a new rule governing the calculation of outlier payments during fiscal since the changes to the outlier formula became effective in august  we have recognized net revenue from outlier payments at estimated amounts determined under the new calculation formula  however  one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries continued to pay us at amounts calculated under the historical formula since august effective may   the medicare fiscal intermediary began paying us at rates consistent with the new calculation formula for our medicare cost report year ending september   thus  we expect no future increase in the million received in outlier payments through april  we have reflected this million  plus accrued interest thereon  as a reduction to our accounts receivable  net  at september  and  consistent with our other estimated reimbursement settlements  and have not recognized the receipt of these outlier payments as net revenue in any affected period 
however  net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal and fiscal were positively impacted by million and million  respectively  for the payments received during these periods 
our cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operations may decrease in the future periods if we are required to repay the amounts upon filing our medicare cost reports 
our operating activities provided net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash provided of million for fiscal the cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
while our cash from operating activities was positively influenced by the million increase in income from continuing operations year over year and the overall reduction in medical supplies inventory  the growth in net receivables and the overall reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities 
we reduced our overall days of net revenue in receivables to days in fiscal from days in fiscal  however  the overall growth in net revenue resulted in a net increase in accounts receivable period to period which negatively impacted our cash flow from operations 
the use of cash for accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal was driven by an overall reduction in accounts payable corresponding with the decrease in total inventory levels due to the timing of bulk purchases and various inventory management initiatives  as well the payment of bonuses accrued as of september  during the first quarter of fiscal our investing activities provided net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash used of million for fiscal the million of net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of the heart hospital of milwaukee  offset in part by capital expenditures for the period 
the million of net cash used by investing activities for fiscal was primarily due to our capital expenditures  related mostly to our hospitals under development during the period  including million of cash used for the heart hospital of milwaukee 
this use of cash was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of certain property and equipment 
even though we have completed our hospital expansion plans and we do not currently have any other hospitals under development  we expect to continue to use cash in investing activities in future periods 
the amount will depend largely on the type and size of strategic investments we make in future periods 
our financing activities used net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash used of million for fiscal the million of net cash used by financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of distributions to  net of investments by  minority partners and the repayment of long term 
table of contents debt and obligations under capital leases partially offset by proceeds from exercised stock options 
the million of net cash used by financing activities for fiscal was the result of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  inclusive of debt transactions included as a part of discontinued operations  offset in part by repayments of long term debt and obligations under capital leases obligations as well as repayments of loan acquisition costs and distributions to minority partners 
capital expenditures 
expenditures for property and equipment for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
for fiscal year  our capital expenditures principally were focused on improvement to and expansion of existing facilities  whereas approximately million of expenditures were made in fiscal for our two newest facilities 
the amount of capital expenditures we incur in future periods will depend largely on the type and size of strategic investments we make in future periods 
obligations  commitments and availability of financing 
as described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we had certain cash obligations at september   which are due as follows in thousands payments due by fiscal year thereafter total long term debt obligations under capital leases total debt other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps interest on indebtedness operating leases total other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps  consists of non current portion of deferred compensation under nurse retention arrangements at two of our hospitals 
interest on indebtedness represents only fixed rate indebtedness 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
concurrent with our offering of the notes  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks and other institutional lenders 
the new credit facility provides for a seven year term loan facility in the amount of million  all of which was drawn in july  and a five year senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million which includes a million sub limit for the issuance of stand by and commercial letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line loans 
proceeds from these debt facilities combined with cash on hand were used to repay million of the long term debt outstanding at that time 
at september   we had million of outstanding debt  million of which was classified as current 
of the outstanding debt  million was outstanding under our senior notes  million was outstanding under our credit facility and million was outstanding to lenders to our hospitals 
the remaining million of debt was outstanding to lenders for diagnostic services under capital leases and other miscellaneous indebtedness  primarily equipment notes payable and capital leases 
no amounts were outstanding to lenders under our million revolving credit facility at september  at the same date  however  we had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced our availability under this facility to million 
covenants related to our long term debt restrict the payment of dividends and require the maintenance of specific financial ratios and amounts and periodic financial reporting 
at september   we were in violation of a financial covenant under an equipment loan to heart hospital of lafayette and we anticipate continuing to be in violation of this covenant in future periods 
accordingly  the total outstanding balance of this loan of million has been included in current portion of long term debt and obligations under capital leases 
table of contents as of september  as of september   we were working with the lender to amend the financial covenant 
we were also in violation of a financial covenant under an equipment loan to louisiana heart hospital 
the equipment lender has granted a waiver for the violation at september  we were in compliance with all other covenants in the instruments governing our outstanding debt at september  at september   we guaranteed either all or a portion of the obligations of our subsidiary hospitals for equipment and other notes payable 
we provide these guarantees in accordance with the related hospital operating agreements  and we receive a fee for providing these guarantees from the hospitals or the physician investors 
we also guarantee approximately of the real estate and of the equipment debt of avera heart hospital of south dakota  the one hospital in which we owned a minority interest at september   and therefore do not consolidate the hospital s results of operations and financial position 
we provide this guarantee in exchange for a fee from the hospital 
at september   avera heart hospital of south dakota was in compliance with all covenants in the instruments governing its debt 
the total amount of the hospital s real estate and equipment debt was approximately million and million  respectively  at september  accordingly  the real estate debt and the equipment debt guaranteed by us was approximately million and million  respectively  at september  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of the terms  covenants and repayment schedule surrounding our debt 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and available borrowings under our new credit facility  together with the remaining net proceeds of our initial public offering and borrowings available under equipment debt commitments will be sufficient to finance our business plan  capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next to months 
intercompany financing arrangements 
concurrent with our new financing  we provided secured real estate and equipment financings to our majority owned hospitals 
the aggregate amount of the intercompany real estate  equipment and working capital loans outstanding as of september  was million 
each intercompany real estate loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s real estate  building and equipment and certain other assets 
each intercompany real estate loan amortizes based on a year term  matures on june  and accrues interest at variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin 
the weighted average interest rate for the intercompany real estate loans at september  was 
each intercompany equipment loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s equipment and certain other assets 
amounts borrowed under the intercompany equipment loans are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest over terms that range from to years 
the intercompany equipment loans accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from to or variable rates based on libor plus and applicable margin 
the weighted average interest rate for the intercompany equipment loans at september  was 
we receive a fee from the minority partners in the subsidiary hospitals as consideration for providing these intercompany real estate and equipment loans 
we also use intercompany financing arrangements to provide cash support to individual hospitals for their working capital and other corporate needs 
we provide these working capital loans pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements between our physician and hospital investor partners and us at each of our hospitals 
these intercompany loans are evidenced by promissory notes that establish borrowing limits and provide for a market rate of interest to be paid to us on outstanding balances 
these intercompany loans are subordinated to each hospital s mortgage and equipment debt outstanding  but are senior to our equity interests and our partners equity interest in the hospital venture and are secured  subject to the prior rights of the senior lenders  in each instance by a pledge of the borrowing hospital s accounts receivable 
also as part of our intercompany financing and cash management structure  we sweep cash from individual hospitals as amounts are available in excess of the individual hospital s working capital needs 
these funds are advanced pursuant to cash management 
table of contents agreements with the individual hospital that establish the terms of the advances and provide for a rate of interest to be paid consistent with the market rate earned by us on the investment of its funds 
these cash advances are due back to the individual hospital on demand and are subordinate to our equity investment in the hospital venture 
as of september  and september   we held million and million  respectively  of intercompany working capital notes and related accrued interest  net of advances from our hospitals 
because these intercompany notes receivable and related interest income are eliminated with the corresponding notes payable and interest expense at our consolidating hospitals in the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the amounts outstanding under these notes do not appear in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
information about the aggregate amount of these notes outstanding from time to time may be helpful  however  in understanding the amount of our total investment in our hospitals 
in addition  we believe investors and others will benefit from a greater understanding of the significance of the priority rights we have under these intercompany notes receivable to distributions of cash by our hospitals as funds are generated from future operations  a potential sale of a hospital  or other sources 
because these notes receivable are senior to the equity interests of medcath and our partners in each hospital  in the event of a sale of a hospital  the hospital would be required first to pay to us any balance outstanding under its intercompany note prior to distributing any of the net proceeds of the sale to any of the hospital s equity investors as a return on their investment based on their pro rata ownership interests 
also  appropriate payments to us to amortize principal balances outstanding and to pay interest due under these notes are generally made to us from a hospital s available cash flows prior to any pro rata distributions of a hospital s earnings to the equity investors in the hospitals 
on december   we completed the sale of certain assets of the heart hospital of milwaukee for million 
of the million in proceeds received  approximately million was used to repay the heart hospital of milwaukee s intercompany secured loans  thereby increasing our consolidated cash position on such date 
as part of the terms of the sale  we were required to close the hospital 
as such  we incurred costs associated with the closing of the hospital  in addition to costs associated with completing the sale and additional operating expenses 
as stipulated by the covenants of our senior credit facility  within days after the receipt of the net proceeds  we may identify a use of the net proceeds for capital expenditures or other permitted investments  so long as such usage occurs within days of the date identified  which we have done 
any net proceeds not identified or invested within this time period must be used to repay principal of senior secured indebtedness 
the lenders under our credit facility have waived this requirement 
however  the indenture governing our senior notes contains a similar requirement 
accordingly  we are currently offering to repurchase up to million of our senior notes 
we have  during fiscal  and will continue in future periods  provided information on a quarterly basis about the aggregate amount of these intercompany loans outstanding to assist investors in better understanding the total amount of our investment in our hospitals  our claim to the future cash flows of our hospitals  and our capital structure 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing changes in reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs that will continue to limit payments we receive under these programs 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to legislative and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments may  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of our hospitals or require other changes in our operations 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 

table of contents inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages  such as the growing nationwide shortage of qualified nurses  occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have  to date  offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services and expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover  or offset  future cost increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a policy for managing risk related to exposure to variability in interest rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates and prices which includes considering entering into derivative instruments freestanding derivatives  or contracts or instruments containing features or terms that behave in a manner similar to derivative instruments embedded derivatives in order to mitigate our risks 
in addition  we may be required to hedge some or all of our market risk exposure  especially to interest rates  by creditors who provide debt funding to us 
to date  we have only entered into the fixed interest rate swaps as discussed below 
as required by their mortgage loans  three of our consolidated hospitals entered into fixed interest rate swaps during fiscal these fixed interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rate on the hedged portion of the related debt at plus the applicable margin for two of the hospitals and at plus the applicable margin for the other hospital 
these interest rate swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges prior to the repayment of the outstanding balances of the mortgage debt for these three hospitals as part of the july financing transaction 
we did not terminate the interest rate swaps as part of the financing transaction  which resulted in the recognition of a loss of approximately million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal since july  the fixed interest rate swaps have not been utilized as a hedge of variable debt obligations  and accordingly  changes in the valuation of the interest rate swaps have been recorded directly to earnings as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at september  was an obligation of million resulting in an unrealized gain of million during fiscal our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk exposure through that portion of our borrowings that bear interest based on variable rates 
as a result of our july financing transaction  our outstanding debt subject to variable rates of interest decreased to approximately of our total debt at september  compared to approximately at september  our debt obligations at september  included approximately million of variable rate debt at an approximate average interest rate of 
a one hundred basis point change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively
