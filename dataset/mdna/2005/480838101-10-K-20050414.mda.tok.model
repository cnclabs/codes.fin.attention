part i item business explanatory note on february   in a letter to the center for public company audit firms american institute of certified public accountants the sec letter  the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission the sec expressed the views of the sec staff concerning certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
specifically  the sec letter addressed the appropriate accounting for the amortization of leasehold improvements by a lessee in an operating lease with lease renewals  the pattern of recognition of rent when the lease term in an operating lease contains a period where there are free or reduced rents commonly referred to as rent holidays  and incentives related to leasehold improvements provided by a landlord lessor to a tenant lessee in an operating lease 
like many other companies in the retail industry  the company has re evaluated its lease accounting practices in light of the sec letter 
as previously disclosed in the company s current report on form k dated february   the company s audit committee concluded that the financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k for fiscal years and  as well as those in the company s quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended may   july  and october   should no longer be relied upon and that the company should restate its financial statements for the two year period ended january  and for the first three quarters of fiscal this annual report on form k gives effect to the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended february  fiscal  february  fiscal  february  fiscal and january  fiscal  for the first three quarters of fiscal and for all four quarters of fiscal to reflect the revision to its historical practices of accounting for lease transactions  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of leasehold improvements in order to comply with gaap regarding amortization of leasehold improvements discussed in the sec letter  the company revised the straight line rent schedules for thirteen of its stores to achieve consistency with the corresponding leasehold amortization schedules 
rent holidays in the sec letter  the sec staff reiterated that gaap requires rent holidays in an operating lease should be recognized by the lessee on a straight line basis over the lease term including any rent holiday period 
in prior periods  the company had generally recognized the straight line expense for a lease beginning on the date the store opened  which was generally the date the lease term commenced in accordance with the lease 
the period during which the store was being constructed was excluded from the straight line rent schedule because the construction period was not considered to be part of the lease term in accordance with the lease 
based on our re evaluation  the company has concluded that the construction period should be included in the straight line rent schedule 
as a result of the change of its rent schedules  the company has restated the consolidated financial statements for fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  for the first three quarters of fiscal and for all four quarters of fiscal the changes are inclusive of the immaterial changes resulting from the modification of the rent schedules to achieve consistency with the corresponding leasehold amortization schedules  as set forth above 
landlord contributions leasehold improvement incentives provided by a landlord to the company were previously recorded by the company as a reduction of the property  plant and equipment account on its balance sheet and amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense in its income statement 
however  gaap requires that such incentives should be recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to lease expense 
as a result  the company s property  plant and equipment asset account and deferred rent liability account were increased which required increases to cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used for investing activities in equal amounts 
accordingly  the company has restated the consolidated financial statements for fiscal     for the first three quarters of fiscal and for all four quarters of fiscal these landlord contributions will be amortized over the life of the lease as a reduction to rent expense 
the impact of the restatement on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  was an increase in the total property  plant and equipment account of million and an increase in the deferred rent liability account of million 
the impact of the restatement is a decrease in net income of 
million  
million  
million and 
million for fiscal years   and  respectively  from amounts previously reported 
the restatement decreased reported diluted earnings per share by   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the cumulative effect of the restatement for all years prior to fiscal was 
million  which was recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at january  the restatement also had a cumulative increase to deferred income taxes of 
million as of january  the restatement did not have any impact on our previously reported sales or comparable store sales or on our compliance with any financial covenant under our line of credit facility or other debt instruments 
the restatement also decreased reported diluted earnings per share by  and for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the company has not amended and does not intend to amend its previously filed annual reports on form k or its quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the restatement  including without limitation for the periods ended may   july  and october  for this reason  the consolidated financial statements  auditors reports and related financial information for the affected periods contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon

overview net income in fiscal increased to approximately million compared with approximately million in fiscal the increased earnings in fiscal were primarily attributable to increase in net sales with increases in both the stores and direct marketing catalog and internet segments  basis point increase in gross profit margins  and the opening of new stores 
management believes that the chain can grow to approximately stores from the fiscal year end base of stores 
the company plans to open between to stores in fiscal as part of its plan to grow the chain to the store level 
the store growth is part of a strategic plan the company initiated in fiscal in the past five years  the company has continued to increase the number of store openings as infrastructure and performance has improved 
as such  there were ten new stores opened in fiscal including two factory stores  new stores in fiscal  new stores in fiscal  new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal capital expenditures should be approximately million in fiscal  primarily to fund the opening of approximately to new stores  the renovation and or relocation of several stores  and the implementation of various systems initiatives 
the capital expenditures include the cost of the construction of leasehold improvements for new stores of which million is expected to be reimbursed through landlord contributions 
the company also expects inventories to increase in to support new store openings  sales growth in existing segments and other initiatives 
the company ended fiscal with no revolver debt  million of term debt and million of cash 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  which was used to fund a increase in the number of stores and to reduce total debt by approximately million 
the company s credit agreement with its bank extends to april and allows the company to borrow a maximum revolving amount under the facility up to million 
in addition  the company has the option to increase the amount borrowed to million  if requested by april   if needed and if supported by its borrowing base formula under the credit agreement 
the company s availability in excess of outstanding borrowings  as supported by the existing borrowing base under its credit agreement  was million at january  compared with million at the same time in fiscal common stock dividends 
on january   the company s board of directors declared a common stock dividend payable on february  to stockholders of record as of january  on june   the company s board of directors declared a common stock dividend payable on august  to stockholders of record as of july  unless otherwise indicated  all historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to the number of common shares elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements  and notes thereto  have been restated to reflect the two stock dividends 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements  a number of assumptions and estimates are made that  in the judgment of management  are proper in light of existing general economic and company specific circumstances 
for a detailed discussion on the application of this and other accounting policies  see note in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
inventory 
the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market lcm 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
the company reduces the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value where cost exceeds estimated selling price less costs of disposal 
management s sales assumptions are based on the company s experience that most of the company s inventory is sold through the company s primary sales channels with virtually no inventory being liquidated through bulk sales to third parties 
the company s lcm reserve estimates for inventory that have been made in the past have been very reliable as a significant portion of its sales approximately in fiscal are classic traditional products that are on going programs and that bear low risk of write down 
these products include items such as navy and gray suits  navy blazers  white and blue button down shirts  etc 
the portion of the products that have seasonal or fashion elements are monitored closely to ensure that aging goals are achieved to limit the need to sell significant amounts of product below cost 
in addition  the company s strong gross profit margins enable the company to sell substantially all of its products at levels above cost 
to calculate the estimated market value  the company periodically performs a detailed review of all of its major inventory classes and stock keeping units 
the company compares the on hand units and season to date unit sales including actual selling prices to the sales trend and estimated prices required to sell the units in the future  which enables the company to estimate the amount which may have to be sold below cost 
substantially all units sold below cost are sold in the company s factory stores within twenty four months of purchase 
in fiscal and  the company s costs in excess of selling price plus the cost of disposal in its factory stores was million and million  respectively 
the inventory component of these costs is recorded in cost of goods sold whereas the related costs of disposal are recorded as selling and marketing expenses 
the company anticipates similar results in fiscal year if the inventory required to be sold through the factory stores or liquidated through other means varies from the estimate  the company s lcm reserve could change 
asset valuation 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment subject to depreciation  are periodically reviewed for impairment to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the asset valuation estimate is principally dependent on the company s ability to generate profits at both the company and store levels 
these levels are principally driven by the sales and gross profit trends that are closely monitored by the company 
in each of fiscal years and  the asset valuation charges have been less than  as sales and profits have increased throughout this period 
lease accounting 
the company uses a consistent lease period generally  the initial non cancelable lease term plus renewal option periods provided for in the lease that can be reasonably assured when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements and in determining straight line rent expense and classification of its leases as either an operating lease or a capital lease 
the lease term and straight line rent expense commences on the date when the company takes possession and has the right to control use of the leased premises 
funds received from the lessor intended to reimburse the company for the costs of leasehold improvements is recorded as a deferred credit resulting from a lease incentive and amortized over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense 
while the company has taken reasonable care in preparing these estimates and making these judgments  actual results could and probably will differ from the estimates 
management believes any difference in the actual results from the estimates will not have a material effect upon the company s financial position or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  fas r 
this statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
currently  companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
the company has chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in fas r  however  in adopting this standard  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption we have used continues to be available  but we have not yet completed our assessment of the alternatives 
fas r will be effective for the company beginning with the third quarter of transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts that have been included in their footnotes 
the company has not yet concluded on which transition option will be selected 
see proforma disclosures of stock based compensation discussion above for the pro forma effect of a full year application  using our existing valuation and amortization assumptions 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table is derived from the company s consolidated statements of income and sets forth  for the periods indicated  the items included in the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
percentage of net sales fiscal year as restated as restated net sales cost of goods sold gross profit sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses store opening costs operating income interest expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal total full line store sales increased in fiscal due primarily to an increase in comparable store sales and the opening of new stores as shown below 
direct marketing sales increased due primarily to increased catalog circulation and an increase in the internet customer database and internet affiliates 
the catalog circulation was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal comparable store sales increased in fiscal for comparable stores  the average dollars per transaction dpt increased in fiscal partially as the result of increased sales of higher priced signature and signature gold products and the development of new products 
traffic as measured by transactions in comparable stores also increased in fiscal  while items per transaction decreased 
all major product categories generated sales increases in fiscal  lead by sales of sportswear which increased over 
sales of the more luxurious signature and signature gold suits  which represented of suit sales in fiscal  increased over in that period as compared with the same period last year 
for fiscal and  suits represented approximately and of total merchandise sales  respectively 
the company expects fiscal sales to increase over the same periods of fiscal as a result of the additional new stores and the opportunity for comparable store and direct marketing sales increases 
net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new stores as follows fiscal fiscal stores square feet stores square feet stores open at the beginning of the year stores opened stores closed stores open at the end of the year square feet is presented in thousands and excludes franchise stores historically  jos 
a 
bank has included new stores in its comparable store base at the end of the first full fiscal year after opening 
existing stores have been excluded from the comparable store sales if a new store has opened in their immediate market area within zero to ten miles during the previous twelve months 
because of the company s store expansion strategy  which emphasizes the opening of stores in existing as well as new markets  management believes this method of calculating comparable store sales accurately reflects relevant sales trends 
beginning in fiscal  comparable store sales will include merchandise sales generated in all full line stores that have been open for at least thirteen full months  including retail locations that have had a new jos 
a 
bank store open in their immediate market area within zero to ten miles during the previous twelve months  similar to other specialty stores 
if the company had calculated its comparable store sales using this new methodology  the comparable store sales increase for fiscal year would have approximated  versus the noted above  a difference of nine tenths of one percentage point 
for fiscal year  the company previously reported a gain of in comparable store sales 
if the company had calculated its comparable store sales using the new methodology  the increase in comparable store sales for fiscal year would have been approximately  a difference of seven tenths of one percentage point 
total sales would remain the same under either method  an increase of in and in gross profit gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold increased to million or of net sales in fiscal from million or of net sales in fiscal  an increase of basis points 
the increased gross profit percentage is primarily due to the continued improvement in sourcing of merchandise  thus reducing the cost of items purchased and increases in retail prices primarily as sales of its new products and the more luxurious signature and signature gold products increased 
gross profit margins increased in substantially all major product categories 
the company s gross profit classification may not be comparable to the classification used by certain other entities 
some entities include distribution  store occupancy  buying and other costs in cost of goods sold 
other entities including the company exclude such costs from gross profit  including them instead in general administrative and or sales marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  which consist primarily of a full line store  factory store and direct marketing occupancy  payroll  selling and other variable costs and b total company advertising and marketing expenses  increased to million or of sales in fiscal from million or of sales in fiscal the million increase in sales and marketing expenses relates primarily to a million of additional costs incurred in the stores opened in fiscal and the stores which opened in fiscal  b million additional costs related to expenses in the stores which were open prior to fiscal and c the remainder relates primarily to costs of the direct channel for higher circulation and sales related costs 
the company expects sales and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal primarily as a result of opening to new stores  the full year operation of stores that were opened during fiscal  and an increase in advertising expenditures 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began testing cable television as a method to increase its brand awareness and to drive customers to its stores 
we also began using national magazines to increase our brand awareness 
the company expects to continue testing these channels as alternative methods to increase sales and brand awareness 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of corporate payroll and overhead costs and distribution center costs  increased million in fiscal total corporate payroll including incentive compensation and corporate overhead costs increased million and million  respectively  in fiscal the increases in corporate overhead costs were primarily due to a higher travel costs and other expenses related to business expansion  b professional fees principally related to approximately million spent for internal control documentation efforts in compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and c the payment of approximately 
million to the state of new york as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total distribution center costs were million and million in and  respectively 
the company expects distribution center costs to increase in the future as it has leased additional warehouse space and it expects to process an increasing amount of inventory units to support future growth 
continued growth in the stores and direct marketing segments may result in additional increases in these expenses 
store opening costs store opening costs  which include the initial promotional advertising costs as well as other start up costs such as travel for recruitment  training and setup of new stores  decreased 
million due primarily to the location of new store openings which impact the travel incurred for the stores and planned reduced advertising for new stores in fiscal versus fiscal interest expense  net interest expense increased 
million due primarily to slightly higher borrowing levels due to higher capital expenditures related to the opening of new stores 
average revolver loan borrowings increased million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal management expects peak borrowing levels and interest to increase in fiscal to fund the opening of additional stores and growth in inventory levels 
income taxes the fiscal effective income tax rate decreased to compared with in the fiscal the decrease was primarily due to non deductible compensation under section m of internal revenue code representing a smaller percentage of the full year profitability of the company 
the income tax rate for fiscal includes a reduction of previously recorded income tax liabilities settled or otherwise resolved in of approximately 
million 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal total full line store sales increased in fiscal due primarily to an increase in comparable store sales and the opening of new stores as shown below

certain additional business risk factors this annual report on form k includes and incorporates by reference certain statements that may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for certain forward looking statements so long as such information is identified as forward looking and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the information 
when used in this annual report on form k  the words estimate  project  plan  will  anticipate  expect  intend  outlook  may  believe  and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements and information 
actual results may differ materially from those forecast due to a variety of factors outside of the company s control that can affect the company s operating results  liquidity and financial condition such as risks associated with economic  weather  public health and other factors affecting consumer spending  the ability of the company to finance its expansion plans  the mix and pricing of goods sold  the market price of key raw materials such as wool and cotton  availability of lease sites for new stores  the ability to source product from its global supplier base and other competitive factors 
these cautionary statements qualify all of the forward looking statements the company makes herein 
the company cannot assure you that the results or developments anticipated by the company will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that those results or developments will result in the expected consequences for the company or affect the company  its business or its operations in the way the company expects 
the company cautions you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their respective dates  and assumes no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements 
the company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
growth risks 
a significant portion of the company s growth has resulted and is expected to continue to result from the opening of new stores 
while the company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain suitable locations for new stores  negotiate acceptable lease terms  hire qualified personnel and open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis  no such assurances can be made 
as the company continues its expansion program  the opening of stores may adversely affect catalog and internet sales in such markets  and the opening of additional stores in existing markets may adversely affect sales and profits of established stores 
competition 
the retail apparel business is highly competitive and is expected to remain so 
the company competes primarily with specialty and discount store chains  independent retailers  national and local department stores  internet retail stores and other catalogers engaged in the retail sale of apparel  and to a lesser degree with other apparel retailers 
many of these competitors are much larger than the company and have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
the company believes that its emphasis on classic styles makes it less vulnerable to changes in fashion trends than many apparel retailers  however  the company s sales and profitability depend upon the continued demand for its classic styles 
the company faces a variety of competitive challenges including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing its products to consumers in several diverse market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  competitively pricing its products and achieving customer perception of value  and providing strong and effective marketing support 
consumer spending 
the company s business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including political and economic conditions such as the levels of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
declines in consumer spending on apparel and accessories could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
reliance on key suppliers 
historically  the company has bought a substantial portion of its products from a limited number of suppliers throughout the world 
the loss of any one of these suppliers could cause a delay in the company s sales process 
any significant interruption in the company s product supply could have an adverse effect on its business due to delays in finding alternative sources and could result in increased costs to the company 
the company expects to continue to spread its sourcing to suppliers throughout the world  with additional concentrations of sourcing to be done in certain countries 
in addition  certain apparel quotas on imports from china have been removed or increased by january  the change could potentially provide opportunities for lower product costs if the company increases the amount of products sourced from china or elsewhere in the region 
the company has not experienced any material disruptions in its sourcing in the past several years 
however  long term disruptions of supply from any of these sources could have a material impact on the company 
market price of raw materials 
the company s products are manufactured using several key raw materials  including wool and cotton  which are subject to fluctuations in price and availability 
historically  the company has not experienced significant fluctuations in price or availability 
however  any significant increase in the price or decrease in the availability of certain raw materials could have an adverse impact on the company s business 
disaster causing disruption of normal operations 
factors such as an interruption of key business systems  any disaster or casualty resulting in the interruption of service from our distribution center  changes in weather patterns  world health concerns such as the sars virus  and international and domestic acts of terror could negatively affect the company s financial performance 
fashion trends and changing consumer preferences 
the company must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed 
the company s success is dependent upon its ability to gauge the fashion tastes of its customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner 
the retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated  in part  by fashion and season 
to the extent the company misjudges the market for its merchandise  its sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect its operating results 
while the company believes its current strategies and initiatives appropriately address these issues  merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on its image with its customers and on its operating results 
the company s ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key personnel in its design  merchandising  marketing and other staff 
competition for these personnel is intense  and the company cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods 
fluctuations in the demand for tailored and casual clothing and accessories affect the inventory levels  since merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases 
in addition  as the company s business is becoming more cyclical in nature  the company must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially prior to peak selling seasons when the company builds up its inventory levels 
the company issues purchase orders for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  the company is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases
