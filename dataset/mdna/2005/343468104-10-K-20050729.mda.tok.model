item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors and uncertainties we have incurred losses in recent years and we may be unable to achieve profitability 
our net losses for each of the fiscal years ended april   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we believe our recently completed restructuring and related cost cutting initiatives will reduce overall spending 
if our restructuring efforts fail to adequately reduce costs  or if our sales are less than we project  we will continue to incur losses in future periods 
economic weakness in our served markets may adversely affect our ability to meet our sales projections 
economic weakness in our served markets may adversely affect our financial results 
the products we sell are capital goods with individual system prices ranging from  to several million dollars 
many of our customers depend on long term financing from a financial institution to purchase our equipment 
economic weakness in the capital goods market and or a credit tightening by the banking industry would reduce our sales and accordingly affect our financial results 
if we fail to comply with our financing arrangements  our ability to continue operations would be impaired 
under the current senior credit agreement entered into on july   we are operating under a credit agreement with our senior lenders which expires july  and sets forth specific financial covenants to be attained on a quarterly basis 
in addition  our agreement includes subjective acceleration clauses which permit the lenders to demand payment on the determination of a material adverse change in the business 
in the event of default  the senior lenders may limit our access to borrow funds as needed 
our ability to continue operating is dependent on the senior lenders willingness to grant access to funds 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary funds  our ability to continue operations would be seriously impaired unless we are able to obtain alternative financing from another source 
in the event of a default  obtaining alternative financing may be difficult and may be at less favorable terms 
we may be unable to achieve our projected operating results and maintain compliance with the loan covenants which would trigger an event of default with our lenders 
in an event of default  the lenders would be in the position to exercise default remedies which include applying a default interest rate and acceleration of payment schedules for our outstanding debt 
our lenders may pursue any number of plans to reduce the outstanding debt  including  in certain circumstances  a liquidation of some or all of our assets 
if our form s registration statement which will contain fiscal results  does not become effective by september  or becomes ineffective for more than days  after having gone effective  we may be subject to significant financial penalties 
under terms of a registration rights agreement entered into on march   as part of a private investment in public equity transaction pipe transaction  we are required to have the form s  which registers the shares sold in the pipe transaction  to become effective no later that september  in addition  the registration statement cannot become ineffective for more than days not necessarily consecutive 
if either of these events occur  then we will be subject to a cash penalty of up to  per month for each month the registration statement is not effective 
certain factors that could cause the registration statement to become or remain ineffective are not within our control 
if we are unable to retain the current members of our senior management team and other key personnel  our future success may be negatively impacted 
we may lose key management personnel and encounter difficulties replacing these positions 
we may have to incur greater costs to attract replacement personnel 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights  or our possible infringement on the proprietary rights of others  and related litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we defend our intellectual property rights because unauthorized copying and sale of our proprietary equipment and consumables represents a loss of revenue to us 
from time to time we also receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights 
the number of these claims may grow in the future  and responding to these claims may require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products  or to pay damages 
on november   omax corporation omax filed suit against us alleging that our products infringe on omax s patents 
the suit also seeks to have a specific patent we hold declared invalid 
although the suit seeks damages of over million  we believe omax s claims are without merit and we intend not only to contest omax s allegations of infringement but also to vigorously pursue our claims against omax with regard to our own patent 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of contingencies 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline and limit our shareholders ability to sell our common stock in the public market 
in the past  our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and we expect them to continue to do so in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our operating results may in some future quarter fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
in addition to the risks disclosed elsewhere in this prospectus  factors outside of our control that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past and that may affect us in the future include fluctuations in general economic conditions  demand for uhp pumps and uhp water management systems generally  fluctuations in the capital budgets of customers  and development of superior products and services by our competitors 
in addition  factors within our control  such as our ability to deliver equipment in a timely fashion  have caused our operating results to fluctuate in the past and may affect us similarly in the future 
the factors listed above may affect both our quarter to quarter operating results as well as our long term success 
given the fluctuations in our operating results  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance or to determine any trend in our performance 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could cause the market price of and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially  which may limit your ability to sell our common stock on the public market 
we do business in industries that are cyclical  which may result in weakness in demand for our products 
our products are sold in many industries  including machine tool  automotive and aerospace  that are highly cyclical 
the machine tool industry  in particular from through  experienced a significant decline in global demand 
cyclical weaknesses in the industries that we serve could lead to a reduced demand for our products 
we may be affected by rising costs or lack of availability of materials  which could negatively impact our operations 
we have experienced and may continue to experience significant increases in the costs of materials we use in the manufacture of our products  such as steel  and we may not be able to either achieve corresponding increases in the prices of our products or reduce manufacturing costs to offset these increases  or if we do increase prices  we may experience lower sales 
any of the foregoing may adversely affect our financial results 
if we cannot develop technological improvements to our products through continued research and engineering  our financial results may be adversely affected 
in order to maintain our position in the market  we need to continue to invest in research and engineering to improve our products and technologies and introduce new products and technologies 
if we are unable to make such investment  if our research and development does not lead to new and or improved products or technologies  or if we experience delays in the development or acceptance of new and or improved products  our financial results will be adversely affected 
we have received notice of material weaknesses in internal controls 
consequently  there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected in the current or any future period 
additionally we may conclude that our system of internal controls under section of sarbanes oxley is not effective 
in december  in connection with the restatement of our fiscal  and financial statements  our independent registered public accounting firm reported to our audit committee two matters involving internal controls which our independent registered public accounting firm considered to be material weaknesses in our financial reporting process  as defined by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob in auditing standard no 
as defined by the pcaob  a material weakness is a significant deficiency  or a combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
management agrees and has responded to the audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm and has addressed each matter raised in our independent registered public accounting firm s report 
as of april   we had begun but had not yet completed the remediation of these material weaknesses 
the material weaknesses identified by our independent registered public accounting firm were as follows insufficient analysis  a documentation and review of the consolidation of the financial statements of subsidiaries 
inadequate processes to ensure the accuracy of the reconciliation of inter company accounts 
also  we must improve the consolidation process and controls surrounding adequate monitoring and oversight of the work performed by accounting and financial reporting personnel 
insufficient staffing of the accounting and financial reporting function 
the financial and accounting function requires additional personnel with appropriate skills and training to identify and address the application of technical accounting literature of our transactions and activities 
an in depth review of the remediation process to date  as well as the steps remaining  can be found in item a 
of this form k 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to assess the design and effectiveness of our internal control systems effective april  our independent registered public accounting firm is required to render an attestation report on managements assessment and the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting 
we must complete the documentation  evaluation and remediation of our systems of internal control 
the costs associated with such compliance are likely to be substantial and will negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to conclude that our systems are appropriately designed or effective  which could result in a material misstatement of the financial statements in the future and a decline in the stock price 
we have outstanding options and warrants that have the potential to dilute the return of our existing common shareholders and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we grant stock options to our employees and other individuals 
at april   we had options outstanding to purchase  shares of our common stock  at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
in addition  we currently have outstanding  warrants  for which we are registering the resale of the underlying shares hereby 
the exercise price of the warrants range from 
to per share 
as a result of accounting regulations  which become applicable to us on may   requiring companies to expense stock options  our expenses will increase and our stock price may decline 
a number of publicly traded companies have recently announced that they will begin expensing stock option grants to employees 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb has adopted rule changes with an effective date as of the beginning of fiscal years beginning after june  requiring expensing of stock options 
currently we include such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but do not include stock option expense for employee options in our reported financial statements 
this change in accounting standards will require us to expense stock options  and as a result our reported expenses may increase significantly 
washington law and our charter documents may make an acquisition of us more difficult 
provisions in washington law and in our articles of incorporation  bylaws  and rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors without shareholder approval to increase the number of outstanding shares including shares with special voting rights  each of which could hinder a takeover attempt  provide for a preferred share rights purchase plan or poison pill  impose restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders 
provide that directors may be removed only at a special meeting of shareholders and provide that only directors may call a special meeting  require the affirmative approval of a merger  share exchange or sale of substantially all of the corporation s assets by of the corporation s shares entitled to vote  and provide for day advance notification for shareholder proposals and nominations at shareholder meetings 
market risk exists in our operations from potential adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar in our foreign operations 
a significant portion of our sales take place outside of the united states  and we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the eurodollar  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swedish krona 
in addition  our foreign divisions may have customer receivables and vendor obligations in currencies other than their local currency which exposes us to near term and longer term currency fluctuation risks 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  with functional currencies other than the us dollar  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
aggregate net foreign exchange gains included in the determination of net loss amounted to  for the year ended april  based on our results for the year ended april  for our foreign subsidiaries  and based on the net position of foreign assets less liabilities  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar in all currencies we operate could impact operating income by million and other income expense by million 
our financial position and cash flows could be similarly impacted 
current year foreign sales have benefited from a weak us dollar 
if the dollar were to strengthen against certain foreign currencies  such as the euro and yen  our margins may be negatively affected 
a significant portion of our products sold outside the united states are manufactured domestically 
the weaker us dollar  relative to the local currency of many of the countries we sell into  has made our products less expensive  on a relative basis  when compared to locally manufactured products and products manufactured in certain other countries 
as the us dollar gains in value relative to these foreign currencies  our products will increase in cost to the customer relative to locally produced product and products manufactured in certain other countries  which could negatively impact sales 
current events current senior credit agreement 
until april   our long term financing consisted of a senior credit agreement originally entered into on july  whose maturity date was august  senior credit agreement and a subordinated debt agreement subordinated debt agreement 
on april   we entered into a new senior debt agreement april senior credit agreement for the purpose of being able to pay off the subordinated debt agreement  which was done 
the april senior credit agreement also had a maturity date of august  on july   we entered into a new senior credit agreement  with a maturity date of july  current senior credit agreement 
at certain places in this report  we refer to senior credit arrangements referring to one or more of the senior credit agreements when identification of a particular agreement is not important 
the current senior credit agreement is a million  three year agreement with bank of america na and na bank na it bears interest at bank of america s prime rate at april  or is linked to libor plus a percentage depending on our leverage ratios  at our option 
the agreement sets forth specific financial covenants to be attained on a quarterly basis  which we believe  based on our financial forecasts  are achievable 
the financial covenants in the current senior credit agreement are less restrictive than in the earlier senior credit arrangements 
restructuring 
in fiscal  we completed a plan intended to return us to profitability through reductions in headcount  consolidation of facilities and operations  and closure or divestiture of selected operations 
we evaluated the workforce and skill levels necessary to satisfy the expected future requirements of the business 
as a result  we implemented plans to eliminate redundant positions and realign and modify certain roles based on skill assessments 
we recorded restructuring charges of million and  for the years ended april  and  respectively  which are shown in the table below in thousands year ended april  year ended april  severance benefits facility exit costs inventory write down these charges included employee severance related costs for approximately individuals 
the fiscal reductions in the global workforce were made across manufacturing  engineering and general and administrative functions 
we have also recorded facility exit costs for the year ended april  primarily as a result of consolidating our two kent facilities into one facility  vacating the manufacturing warehouse portion of our flow europe facility and reducing the space utilized in our swedish manufacturing facility 
in addition  we scrapped some obsolete parts  returned surplus parts to vendors and sold parts to third parties  in conjunction with the shutdown of our manufacturing operation in europe and standardization of our product line 
the fiscal restructuring related to employee reductions in the food segment as well as closure of our memphis sales office 
see restructuring accrual information in note to consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended april  and  we incurred 
million and million  respectively  of professional fees associated with the restructuring of our debt in july and july  respectively 
these costs were evaluated under eitf  debtor s accounting for changes in line of credit or revolving debt arrangements  and as they were either expenses related to potential senior credit arrangement with lenders that did not occur  or they related to expenses associated with our subordinated debt and did not result in an increase in the facility and accordingly they were expensed 
avure 
the general press operations  which consist of the north america press and the international press segments  as well as the non ultrahigh pressure portion of the food business  which is included in the food segment  are not considered core to our business and it is our intent to divest ourselves of these operations 
however  there can be no assurance we will find a suitable buyer at an acceptable price 
if we do divest these businesses  it is anticipated that we will enter into a manufacturing agreement to provide the purchaser with the ultrahigh pressure pump components and related spare parts for the fresher under pressure business 
these segments do not meet the accounting criteria to be considered assets held for sale as of april  and accordingly the results of operations are shown as continuing operations and the related assets have not been reported as held for sale in our financial statements 
upon divestiture  we will record to the statement of operations the cumulative translation adjustment of these operations which represent a million credit at april  robotics division 
in an effort to control costs and to focus on our core uhp waterjet systems  on june   we announced that we had expanded our strategic relationship with motoman inc  to deliver standard  pre engineered robotic waterjet cutting solutions to the automotive industry 
the relationship means that motoman  inc will be the primary sales contact with the end user for standard systems and we will sell uhp pumps and parts to motoman  inc to be integrated into the pre engineered robotic cutting system 
at the same time we announced that  in order to re align our resources with this new strategic direction  our custom robotic waterjet cutting system manufacturing would be relocated from wixom  michigan to burlington  ontario 
this closure is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal with restructuring expenses of approximately  these expenses include severance payments for employees  exit expenses for the facility as well as logistical expenses for moving and disposing of equipment and assets

the released pressure portion of our uhp business which we call waterjet  is comprised of the following segments north america waterjet  asia waterjet  other international waterjet and other 
the contained pressure operation which is what we call avure  is made up of the food  north america press and international press segments 
fiscal compared to fiscal tabular amounts in thousands sales 
our sales by segment for the periods noted below is summarized as follows difference sales waterjet north america asia other international other waterjet total avure food north america press international press avure total consolidated total waterjet 
the waterjet operation includes cutting and cleaning operations  which are focused on providing total solutions for the aerospace  automotive  job shop  surface preparation cleaning and paper industries 
it is comprised of four reporting segments north america waterjet  asia waterjet  other international waterjet and other 
the north america  asia and other international waterjet segments primarily represent sales of our standard cutting and cleaning systems throughout the world  as well as sales of our custom designed systems into the aerospace industry 
the other segment represents sales of our automation and robotic waterjet cutting cells  as well as non waterjet systems  which are sold primarily into the north american automotive industry 
for the fiscal year ended april   we reported a million  or  increase in revenue to million versus the prior year comparative period 
all four segments reported an increase in revenue  however million of the million increase was recognized in our north america waterjet segment 
at the end of fiscal  we believed the market awareness of waterjet technology was low and addressed this through an increase in marketing and tradeshow activity  including attendance at the bi annual international manufacturing technology show in early september  as well as increasing the number of domestic waterjet cutting direct sales staff from to  adding two machine tool distributors  acting as agents  and increasing domestic technical services staff from to persons 
the growth in revenue in north america is a result of an increase in unit sales stemming from our increased sales and marketing activity 
there were no significant price increases year over year  however a price increase of on selected systems was implemented on february  aerospace sales  which are also included in the north america segment  were million  up million from the prior year 
the growth in our other segment results from improved non waterjet automated robotic system demand in the domestic automotive industry 
we have not increased our marketing and sales staff in this segment year over year 
our waterjets are experiencing growing acceptance in the marketplace because of their flexibility and superior machine performance 
outside the us  waterjet revenue growth was positively influenced by growth in asia waterjet sales which were million  up million or for the year ended april  this increase was driven largely by sales in china where we experienced strong demand for shapecutting and cutting cell systems from a strengthening automotive industry 
our other international waterjet segment represents primarily sales in europe and south america 
revenues from our european operations have improved by million for the year ended april  to million 
market specific pricing including some price reductions  standardization of system offerings  improved delivery and a recovering european marketplace have helped to increase our european sales 
sales in south america of million for the year ended april  were comparable to the respective prior year period 
the economic conditions in the south america region make it difficult to increase sales 
we are typically able to sell our products at higher prices outside the us due to the costs of servicing these markets 
as much of our product is manufactured in the us  the weakness of the us dollar also has helped strengthen our foreign revenues 
we also analyze our waterjet revenues by looking at system sales and consumable sales 
systems revenues for the year ended april  were million  an increase of million or  compared to the prior year same period due to both strong domestic and global sales from recovering economic conditions 
the majority  million  of the increase was generated domestically 
consumables revenues recorded an increase of million or to million for the year ended april  the majority of the increase in spares sales is domestic and is the result of the increasing number of operating systems  increasing sales of our proprietary productivity enhancing kits  improved parts availability  as well as increased customer acceptance of flowparts 
com  our easy to use internet order entry system 
we believe that spare parts sales should continue to increase as more systems are put into operation 
avure 
the avure operation includes the fresher under pressure technology food segment as well as general press operations north america press and international press segments 
these segments would be eliminated were we to sell avure as described earlier 
revenue in the avure operations is recorded on the percentage of completion basis 
fresher under pressure meets the increasing demand in the us for a post packaging  terminal pasteurization like step eg packaged ready to eat meats  the demand for high quality  minimally processed foods eg fresh guacamole and salsas  and the demand to utilize the productivity enhancing capabilities of uhp in food processing eg shellfish shucking  while the general press business manufactures systems that produce and strengthen advanced materials for the aerospace  automotive and medical industries 
for the year ended april   sales for the food segment decreased 
million or 
general press revenues vary from year to year due to the nature of its sales and production cycle 
the sales and production cycle on a general press can range from one to four years 
as outlined in the table above  north american press sales grew significantly in the year ended april  to million as compared to the prior year period 
this growth is the result of revenue recognized under two large contracts obtained in fiscal and manufactured in fiscal international press sales for the year ended april  decreased million as compared to the prior year 
the international press sales are almost exclusively large contract sales in excess of million per contract and accordingly revenue will vary depending on the number and stage of manufacture of these contracts 
cost of sales and gross margins 
our gross margin by segment for the periods noted below is summarized as follows difference gross margin waterjet north america asia other international other waterjet total avure food north america press international press avure total consolidated total our gross margin as a percent of sales by segment for the periods noted below is summarized as follows gross margin percentage waterjet north america asia other international other waterjet total avure food north america press international press avure total consolidated total gross margin for the year ended april  amounted to million or of sales as compared to gross margin of million or of sales in the prior year period 
generally  gross margin rates will vary period over period depending on the mix of sales  which includes special system  standard system and consumables sales 
gross margin rates on our systems sales are typically less than as opposed to consumables sales which are in excess of 
on average  standard systems which are included in the north america  asia and other international waterjet segments carry higher margins than the custom engineered systems  which are represented by the other  food  north america press and international press segments 
in addition  gross margin as a percent of sales will vary amongst segments due to inter company sales and the related inter company transfer pricing 
for the year ended april   waterjet margins represented million of the overall consolidated margin or of waterjet sales 
the waterjet operations gross margin percentage increased one percentage point from of sales in fiscal the increase in north american waterjet margins were offset in part by the decrease of five percentage points in the other segment in fiscal this weakness stems from a number of very low margin contracts built in fiscal  including several loss contracts which totaled 
million in losses 
all loss contracts were non waterjet related systems 
we have consolidated the management of this division within the other segment  and current contracts appear to be in line with historical gross margins in the automotive industry  between and 
avure margins amounted to million of the overall consolidated margin or of avure sales 
food segment margin percentages improved in the current year as the prior year included several strategic sales at almost a zero margin 
these sales represented the initial sale of equipment into the ready to eat meat industry made in an effort to try and accelerate market adoption and the sale of a development project into the seafood industry that has other industry applications 
the north america press segment margin dollars have increased  however  the margin percentage has decreased for the year ended april  compared to the prior year period 
this is the result of a shift in product mix in fiscal towards equipment manufactured by the international press segment  for which the margins recognized by north america press are lower due to our inter company transfer pricing policies 
the international press margin is the result of gross profit on external sales and gross profit on inter company sales 
our segment reporting excludes inter company sales  but not the related margins 
for fiscal  inter company production is up which has resulted in an increase in the international press margin percentage to 
gross margin percentages on similar type projects remain the same year over year

fiscal also includes over 
million in costs associated with the bi annual international manufacturing technology show held during the second quarter ended october  asia and other international waterjet recorded cost increases in line with changes in sales and the other segment held marketing costs constant

million as outlined below 
this compares to other income  net of million in the prior year period 
other income  net in fiscal includes a million gain on the sale of investment securities we held and net foreign exchange gains and losses 
the following table shows the detail of other income expense  net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations net realized foreign exchange gains net unrealized foreign exchange losses gains realized gain on sale of equity securities minority interest in joint venture other total income taxes 
the fiscal and tax provision consists of current expense related to operations in foreign jurisdictions which are profitable  primarily in taiwan and japan 
in addition  operations in certain jurisdictions principally germany and the united states reported net operating losses for which no tax benefit was recognized as it is more likely than not that such benefit will not be realized 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of foreign asset collateral requirements and our amended credit agreements  we were no longer able to permanently defer foreign earnings and recorded a million liability for withholding taxes payable on future repatriation of foreign earnings 
we also recorded a us tax liability of million on foreign earnings 
the total million tax liability was offset by a reduction of the valuation allowance 
in addition  we continue to assess our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the continued losses generated during fiscal and in prior periods  we have determined it appropriate to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our domestic net operating losses  certain foreign net operating losses and certain other deferred tax assets based on the expected reversal of both deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the domestic net operating losses can be carried forward years to offset domestic profits in future periods and expire between fiscal and fiscal if not used 
our foreign net operating losses currently do not have an expiration date 
we provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets associated with the losses recorded during fiscal net loss 
for the year ended april   our consolidated net loss was million or 
per basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or 
basic and diluted loss per share in the prior year period 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is  for fiscal and  for fiscal there were  and  of potentially dilutive common shares from employee stock options and  and  of potentially dilutive shares from warrants which have been excluded from the diluted weighted average share denominator for fiscal and  respectively  as their effect would be anti dilutive

for the year ended april   total waterjet revenue increased million or to million from million in the prior year 
all of this growth was recorded in the north america  asia and other international waterjet segments  driven by market demand for our dynamic waterjet cutting head and improved global market conditions in the primary industries we serve 
this growth was all volume related as we did not increase prices during fiscal included in the million increase in fiscal in north american waterjet sales is a million or revenue increase over the prior year period for sales of our domestic standard waterjet cutting systems 
our waterjets are experiencing continued acceptance in the marketplace from their flexibility and superior machine performance 
the remainder of the north america waterjet increase relates to an increase in our aerospace business  which totaled million in fiscal driven by the manufacture of the airbus a north american automotive and automation our other segment sales decreased or million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the cyclical nature of the automotive industry 
outside the us  waterjet revenue growth was positively influenced by growth in asian revenues which were up million or for the year ended april  to million  compared to million in the prior year 
these increases were driven largely by sales in japan where we experienced strong demand for our surface preparation and shapecutting systems  due in part to the refurbishment program for us navy ships based in japan 
our other international waterjet segment represents primarily sales into europe and south america 
revenues from our european operations have improved by million or to million during fiscal market specific pricing and standardization of system offerings and a recovering european marketplace contributed to this improvement 
sales into south america are up million due to improvements in sales of surface preparation equipment 
we also analyze our waterjet revenues by looking at system sales and consumable sales 
systems revenues for the year ended april  were million  an increase of million or  compared to the prior fiscal year due to strong global sales from recovering economic conditions driven by a weaker us dollar 
consumables revenues also recorded an improvement of or million to million for the year ended april   compared to the prior year consumable revenue of million 
this is due to increased machine utilization by our customers in north and south america and asia  all of which led to higher parts consumption 
consumables revenue continues to be positively impacted by our proprietary productivity enhancing kits and improved parts availability as well as the introduction of flowparts 
com  our easy to use internet order entry system 
avure 
for the year ended april   revenues for the food segment were million  representing a million  or improvement  compared to the prior year s revenue of million 
a portion of this increase can be attributed to the reversal in the prior year of million of percentage of completion revenue previously recognized on three food systems one customer based on the customer s failure to fulfill its obligations under the contract terms 
additionally  in fiscal  we were able to record revenue of million on fiscal orders where we delivered already completed systems 
these orders did not qualify for percentage of completion accounting and the corresponding revenue was recognized upon delivery and acceptance in fiscal of the systems that were sold 
increased acceptance of the technology drove the remainder of the growth 
for the year ended april   north america press sales were essentially flat with the prior year at million 
international press revenues for the year ended april  increased or million from million for the prior year to million  on stronger order volume and production 
order and production volumes were significantly weaker in due to lower demand for industrial products following the september attacks 
the majority of this revenue increase occurred in europe and  accordingly  net consolidated revenues in europe have increased over the prior year

fiscal gross margin was negatively impacted by a number of adjustments posted during the third quarter of that year which totaled million 
waterjet margins represented million of the overall margin or of waterjet revenues 
we experienced improvement in the gross margin as a percent of revenues in each of the four segments that comprise the waterjet operations 
this gross margin improvement of percentage points  of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in the prior year  was a result of better overhead absorption in light of higher sales volumes of million in the year and on fiscal inventory valuation charges of million which did not recur in the avure margins amounted to million or of avure revenues  up from million or of revenues in the prior year 
this improvement in margin of million was achieved in both the food segment and international press segment of avure 
in fiscal the food gross margin was million or of revenues  up from a gross loss of million in the prior year 
this improvement resulted from increased production volumes and million in prior year adjustments related to percentage of completion and inventory valuation in the food segment 
while gross margin dollars increased in international press due to higher volumes  the gross margin percentages in both the north america press and international press declined slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in north america press is related to slightly declining sales and change in product mix 
the international press margin is the result of gross profit recognized on external as well as inter company sales 
the company s segment reporting excludes inter company sales but not the related gross profit margins 
the decrease in margin on international press results from increases on external sales at a greater rate than the increase in inter company gross profit 
gross margins on international press external sales were constant in and marketing expenses

the majority of this decrease  million  was achieved in the waterjet operations  while million of the decrease was recognized in avure 
fiscal included a million charge  in the waterjet operations  to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the financial conditions of our individual customers and general marketplace conditions 
the predominance of this increase in the allowance was recorded in the other international waterjet segment 
the remainder of the reduction in waterjet marketing expenses over the prior year results from the implementation of cost cutting measures during fiscal aimed at providing return on invested marketing dollars  as well as the fact that the fiscal north america waterjet segment includes the costs of participation at the bi annual imts tradeshow of approximately  within avure  the food segment expense in fiscal included a million discount provided to a customer for early pay off of long term notes 
all segments experienced decreases in expenses as a result of cost cutting measures in fiscal expressed as a percentage of revenue  marketing expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively

the remaining 
million decrease in waterjet is spread evenly throughout all segments within waterjet except asia  which was flat with the prior year 
the reductions in all segments  relate to the timing of research and development work and the increased use of engineers on revenue generating projects  where costs are charged to cost of sales

all segments experienced a decrease in general and administrative expense  except for the north america waterjet segment  up million and the asia waterjet segment  up 
million 
the decreases represent cost cutting measures put in place by management 
the increase in north america waterjet is attributable to higher costs of doing business as a public company following the enactment by congress of the sarbanes oxley act of and include increased directors and officers liability insurance of 
million as well as higher consulting costs for internal control work and other special projects of 
million 
in addition  we resumed the compensation of our board members in fiscal and implemented a performance based bonus plan for management which together amounted to an increase of million

the most significant of this total being incurred in the north america waterjet segment  million  other international waterjet  million and international press  
million 
financial consulting charges 
during the year ended april   we incurred million of professional fees associated with the restructuring of our debt in july these costs were evaluated under eitf  debtor s accounting for changes in line of credit or revolving debt arrangements  and as they were either expenses related to potential senior credit arrangements with lenders that did not occur  or they related to expenses associated with our subordinated debt and did not result in increase in the facility and accordingly they were expensed 
no such costs were incurred for the year ended april  impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges in fiscal during fiscal  we conducted a review of the carrying value of our goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires a company to perform impairment testing when certain triggering events affecting a business unit have taken place 
the triggering events were the expectation of a sale or full or partial disposal of certain of our divisions and the continuing deterioration of the economic climate 
our review resulted in impairment charges of million during the quarter ended january   million was recorded in the other segment and million was recorded in the other international waterjet segment 
the impairment resulted primarily from continued weakness in the automotive industry  as well as weakness in our european operations 
we also prepared an analysis of the fair value of the company s reporting units for our required fas annual assessment 
this assessment  performed as of april   revealed no further impairment 
at april   we also conducted an impairment review of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this review led to a million impairment charge related primarily to the carrying value of the depreciable assets of the food segment 
operating income loss

all segments of our business except for north america press recorded either increases in operating profit or a decrease in the operating loss as compared to fiscal the reasons for the changes in operating profit or loss have been described in the paragraphs above addressing changes in sales  gross margin and operating expenses 
interest and other income expense  net 
fiscal interest expense increased million or to million compared to the prior year of million due to increased amounts of amortization of fees from our credit facilities and a higher weighted average cost of capital from interest charged on the deferred and capitalized semi annual interest payments due to our subordinated lender 
included in other income  net is a million gain from the sale of our investment in wgi heavy minerals 
in addition  the weaker dollar has positively impacted our foreign transactions and we have thus realized net currency gains of million  as well as unrealized currency gains of million in fiscal as the us dollar remains weak  this has also caused other changes in our balance sheet  including an increase in our goodwill and intangible assets due to the translation from foreign currencies 
included in other income  net for the year ended april   are million of net realized foreign exchange transaction losses offset by million of unrealized currency gains

we are providing for income taxes in jurisdictions where we have generated taxable income 
during fiscal  as a result of foreign asset collateral requirements and the amended credit agreements discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  we were no longer able to permanently defer foreign earnings and recorded a million liability for withholding taxes payable on future repatriation of foreign earnings 
we also recorded a us tax liability of million on foreign earnings which we have decided to no longer permanently defer 
the total million tax liability is offset by a release of the valuation allowance 
in addition  we continue to assess our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the continued losses generated during the quarter and in prior periods  we have determined it appropriate to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our domestic net operating losses  certain foreign net operating losses and certain other deferred tax assets based on the expected reversal of both deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of april   we had approximately million of domestic net operating loss carryforwards to offset certain earnings for federal income tax purposes 
all of these net operating loss carryforwards expire in fiscal net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions amount to million and do not expire 
see note to consolidated financial statements for discussion of tax components 
discontinued operations  net of tax 
as of april   we held one of our service subsidiaries for sale and consequently showed its results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale of this subsidiary was consummated may  and resulted in cash proceeds of million and a gain of approximately  net loss 
our consolidated net loss for fiscal amounted to million  or 
basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or basic and diluted loss per share in the prior year 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is  for fiscal and  for fiscal fiscal comprehensive financial review 
during fiscal  we revised our approach to receivable collection  inventory reduction and investigated other cash generating initiatives in response to the continued decline in the economy and our highly leveraged position 
we reviewed the carrying values of those assets that we expected to convert to cash in the short term  as well as long lived tangible and intangible assets and adjusted the carrying value of such assets to reflect their estimated current net realizable value 
in addition  we conducted a review of potential liabilities 
the total adjustments for the year ended april  are included in the consolidated statement of operations 
these adjustments  which are summarized below  were highly influenced by the economic environment our customers and we are facing 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million 
this increase was based on extensive collection efforts and the results of a worldwide receivable by receivable review  including evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions  which had restricted customers ability to pay their account balances 
we evaluated our ability to convert inventories  including evaluation and demonstration units  into cash in the short term by their sale or disposition 
this evaluation led to a total adjustment of million to arrive at the estimated net realizable value of our inventories 
we conducted a detailed review of the carrying value of our goodwill in accordance with fas the triggering events were the expectation of sale or full or partial disposal of certain of our divisions  the continuing deterioration of the economic climate  and our operating losses 
our review resulted in impairment charges of million during the third quarter of fiscal the impairment resulted primarily from continued weakness in the automotive industry  as well poor performance at our european operations 
our required annual fas review as of april  led to no further impairment charges 
we determined that no significant future services would be required of our former ceo 
therefore we accrued and charged to operations all remaining contractual fees and related benefits aggregating approximately million 
during fiscal  we sold million of long term notes receivable for million 
this discount of million plus an additional accrual of million on potential future notes available for sale were recorded in marketing expense 
we accrued an additional million for potential losses related to several recourse repurchase obligations on european sales 
we have from time to time entered into recourse obligations with third party leasing companies 
in response to continued concerns about the financial health of several customers  we revised our estimate of potential future exposure 
included in the million accrual was  for the estimated loss on the repurchase and subsequent sale of a flex form press system  where we had a recourse obligation for a bankrupt customer 
we sold this unit to an unrelated party in fiscal we had deferred million in professional fees associated with previous ongoing strategic transactions  consisting of a planned equity offering and spin off of avure 
we abandoned these plans and accordingly expensed all of these fees 
we reversed percentage of completion revenue previously recognized on three food systems one customer based on the customer s failure to fulfill its obligations under the contract terms 
the total revenue reversed in the third quarter of fiscal was million with an associated gross margin of million 
we received new orders for which we plan to deliver already completed systems from inventory 
accordingly  these specific contracts did not qualify for percentage of completion accounting and the corresponding revenue was recognized upon delivery and acceptance in fiscal we assessed our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the magnitude of the losses generated during the fiscal year  we determined it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  with the exception of our swedish operations  amounting to million as well discontinuing  in the near term  any future recognition of deferred tax assets resulting from losses 
based upon our proposed strategy to downsize and streamline our operations and convert non core or excess assets to cash  we adjusted various other asset values and reserves to appropriately reflect their net realizable value on a prospective basis  in accordance with fas these adjustments totaled million for the year 
liquidity and capital resources at april   approximately million of our cash and restricted cash was held by divisions outside the united states 
the repatriation of offshore cash balances from certain divisions will trigger tax liabilities 
in fiscal  we recorded a million liability for withholding taxes on future repatriation of historical foreign earnings 
in february and june  we repatriated million and million  respectively  from certain foreign subsidiaries and we plan to continue repatriating additional funds in the future 
by april   we completed the execution of our restructuring plan  which resulted in total cash outlays of million including amounts accrued as restructuring charges in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we have funded the restructuring plan from our cash from operations and foreign debt 
the million outlay included completing the construction of our new million taiwanese facility  to which we had committed in july the facility construction was financed via three unsecured lines of credit with taiwanese banks 
we then obtained a collateralized long term credit facility and borrowed million on this facility in june we have used the proceeds to repay and reduce the senior credit facility by million 
the benefits from our restructuring activities are beginning to be reflected in our operating results for the year ended april  and  we believe  should continue into fiscal on march   in a private investment in public equity transaction pipe transaction  we sold  equity units at per unit for gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds of more than million 
a unit consists of one share of our common stock and one warrant to buy th of a share of our common stock 
ten warrants give the holder the right to purchase one share of common stock for 
if the warrant holders opt to exercise their warrants  we would receive million in additional cash 
under terms of pipe transaction  we were required to file an initial form s registration of the shares issued and issuable in the pipe transaction on or before may  which we did and are required to cause the form s to become effective on or before september  we are subject to liquidated damages of  per month  if we fail to meet the september  date requirement 
because the market price of the common stock was greater than  we issued approximately  anti dilution warrants to current warrant holders prior to the pipe transaction which have a black scholes value of approximately million 
approximately  of this amount relates to warrants issued under subordinated debt agreements and  relates to warrants issued under senior debt agreements 
proceeds of the pipe were used to pay down existing debt  including all of the subordinated debt 
upon payoff of the subordinated debt  on april  we also were required to charge to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations all remaining unamortized debt discount  which amounted to million  plus  related to the anti dilution warrants issued to subordinated debt warrant holders prior to the pipe 
in addition  capitalized fees related to the senior agreement of million and  in anti dilutional warrants provided to our senior lenders were evaluated under eitf and accordingly expensed as of april our domestic senior credit agreement credit agreement is our primary source of external funding 
at april   the balance outstanding on the credit agreement was million against a maximum borrowing of million 
our available credit at april   net of million in outstanding letters of credit  was million 
on july   we signed an amendment to the then current credit agreement the amendment 
the amendment provided for a revolving line of credit of up to million and an extension of the credit agreement through august  the commitment reduced to million at april  interest rates under the senior credit agreement were at bank of america s prime rate in effect from time to time plus and increased by one percentage point each quarter beginning november  the amendment also required the issuance of  detachable 
warrants to the senior lender as a fee and a quarterly commitment fee of of basis points of the total commitment 
we also amended our subordinated debt agreement effective july  the subordinated lenders agreed to defer the semi annual interest remittances due on october  and april   which total million 
this deferred interest balance accrues additional interest at the rate of per annum 
the subordinated lenders also received  detachable 
warrants to purchase common stock as an amendment fee 
on april  we entered into a new senior debt agreement the april  credit agreement with bank of america na and na bank na the agreement provided a million commitment which was to expire august  this expiration date was consistent with our previous agreement 
the april  credit agreement  however  gave us the ability to pay off our subordinated debt in its entirety  which we did on april  the april  credit agreement  including covenants  was very similar to the previous senior debt agreement except for the following provisions required the complete pay off of subordinated debt the interest rate was reduced from prime to libor the annualized cost of letters of credit were reduced from to of the face amount the total commitment increased to million  up from the prior debt agreement commitment level of million 
the april  credit agreement was collateralized by general liens on all of our assets 
we were required to comply with certain covenants in the credit agreement  including restrictions on dividends and transactions with affiliates  limitations on additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  research and engineering expenses  and maintenance of ebitda ratios and collateral values 
we were in compliance with all covenants in the april  credit agreement as of april  in addition  the new credit agreement  similar to prior agreements  included a subjective acceleration clauses which permit the lenders to demand payment in the event of a material adverse change 
effective july   we executed a new million  three year senior credit agreement with bank of america na and na bank na this credit agreement expires july  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate at april  or is linked to libor plus a percentage depending on our leverage ratios  at our option 
the agreement sets forth specific financial covenants to be attained on a quarterly basis  which we believe  based on our financial forecasts  are achievable 
we believe that our existing cash  cash from operations  and credit facilities at april  are adequate to fund our operations through april  if we fail to achieve our planned revenues  costs and working capital objectives  management believes it has the ability to curtail capital expenditures and reduce costs to levels that will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements and debt covenants through april  with authorization from the board of directors in september  we engaged the services of danske markets  inc  which is working in europe in cooperation with close associates to assist us in the sale of our general press operations 
these businesses are comprised of the north america press and international press segments 
as these segments do not utilize ultrahigh pressure water pumps  they are not considered core to our business  and it is our intent to divest ourselves of these operations 
however  there can be no assurance we will find a suitable buyer at an acceptable price 
if we do divest these businesses  it is anticipated that we will enter into a manufacturing agreement to provide the purchaser with the ultrahigh pressure pump components and related spare parts for the fresher under pressure business 
these segments do not meet the accounting criteria to be considered assets held for sale as of april  and accordingly the results of operations are shown as continuing operations and the related assets have not been reported as held for sale in our financial statements 
upon divestiture  we will record to the statement of operations the cumulative translation adjustment of these operations which represent a million credit at april  presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at april   by due date

as of april   the fair value of the transactions and related hedges amounts to a net loss of  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
we have included inventory purchase commitments  which are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
these commitments exclude open purchase orders 
these obligations include non inventory vendor commitments  such as professional retainers and trade show commitments 
this table is reporting the contractual due dates of the long term debt and notes payable balances 
interest payments are estimated based on the outstanding debt balances as of april  using the then interest rate in effect through the contractual maturity of the debt instrument 
these estimates may change over time as we opt to refinance our debt instruments 
see note above 
long term debt  notes payable and lease commitments are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other borrowings 
our capital spending plans currently provide for outlays of approximately million in fiscal  primarily related to information technology spending 
it is expected that funds necessary for these expenditures will be generated internally and through available credit facilities 
in fiscal and  our investments in capital equipment were minimal as we were trying to conserve cash and were restricted by our debt agreements on the amount of capital spending we were allowed 
excluding spending on our taiwan facility in  our capital spending for fiscal and amounted to million and million  respectively 
we are required to test our internal controls under sarbanes oxley for the year end april the external costs to achieve sarbanes oxley compliance could exceed million

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these estimates and our accounting policies  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for standard systems and consumable and services sales  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that revenue can only be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all four of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criterion is based on our judgments regarding the collectibility of those amounts 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine this criterion is not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we adopted eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables on a prospective basis 
eitf provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of single or multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
for standard systems  our multiple deliverables are the standard system and the installation thereof 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of the standard system at the fair value of that system 
installation revenue is recorded upon completion of the service 
in some cases  systems are delivered with payment terms contingent on acceptance of installation 
we will recognize revenue for those systems on installation acceptance 
for non standard and long lead time systems  including the avure operation  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the cost to cost method  measuring the costs incurred on a project at a specified date  as compared to the estimated total cost of the project 
percentage of completion requires management to estimate costs to complete 
accordingly  modifications to estimates will impact percentage of completion revenues and associated gross margins 
if  however  the time from order to install is less than three months  revenue is recognized under sab shipping revenues and expenses are recorded in revenue and costs of goods sold  respectively 
product warranty reserve our products are generally covered by a warranty up to months 
we accrue a reserve for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of accounts receivable we use estimates in determining our allowance for bad debts that are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs in our receivables 
in determining the appropriate reserve percentages  we also review current trends in the credit quality of our customers  as well as changes in our internal credit policies 
if our estimate of our allowance is understated  operating income would be reduced 
valuation of obsolete excess inventory we currently record a reserve for obsolete or excess inventory for parts and equipment that are no longer used due to design changes to our products or lack of customer demand 
we regularly monitor our inventory levels and  if we identify an excess condition based on our usage and our financial policies  we record a corresponding reserve 
if our estimate for obsolete or excess inventory is understated  gross margins would be reduced 
valuation of deferred tax assets we review our deferred tax assets regularly to determine their realizability 
when evidence exists that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize a deferred tax asset  we set up a valuation allowance against the asset based on our estimate of the amount which will likely not be realizable 
future utilization of deferred tax assets could result in recording of income tax benefits 
impairment of property and equipment  patents  other intangibles and goodwill we evaluate property and equipment  patents and other intangibles for potential impairment indicators when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors and future plans 
if we conclude that a triggering event has occurred  we will compare the carrying values of the asset with the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from usage of the asset 
if there is a shortfall and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value  we will record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value over fair value 
we estimate fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 
we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment indicators as of our fiscal year end and when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors  and future plans 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill should be evaluated for impairment prior to our fiscal year end 
our impairment evaluation is based on comparing the fair value of the operating division with its associated carrying value and any shortfalls would require us to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and implied value of goodwill 
we determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
expected future operational performance is based on estimates and management s judgment 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 
legal contingencies at any time  we may be involved in certain legal proceedings 
as of april   we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and is based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings 
see legal proceedings 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements for recently issued accounting pronouncements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in our financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  as well as financial risk management and derivatives 
these exposures are related to our daily operations 
interest rate exposure at april   we had million in interest bearing debt 
of this amount  million was fixed rate debt with an interest rate of less than per annum 
the remaining debt of million was at a variable interest rate  million at a rate of prime or and the remainder at an interest rate of swedish prime or less 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on our debt obligations 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate additional annual charge to our pre tax profits and cash flow of  at april   we had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
we may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the eurodollar  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swedish krona 
as all of our foreign operations have functional currencies in other than the us dollar  we translate the assets and liabilities of these operations into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the period
