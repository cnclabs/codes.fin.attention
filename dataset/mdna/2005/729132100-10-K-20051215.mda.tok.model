we then build to order and configure to order and deliver the product directly to the end customer 
the dof process relies on enterprise resource planning erp systems integrated with those of our customers to manage the overall supply chain from parts procurement through manufacturing and logistics 
the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and the risk factors section beginning on page our customers include both industry leading original equipment manufacturers and technology companies that have never manufactured product internally 
as a result of our focus on serving industries that rely on advanced electronics technology  our business is influenced by technological trends such as the level and rate of development of telecommunications infrastructure and the expansion of networks and use of the internet 
in addition  the federal food and drug administration s approval of new medical devices can affect our business 
our business has also benefited from the trend to increased outsourcing by oem s 
we provide most of our contract manufacturing services on a turnkey basis  which means that we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly 
we provide some services on a consignment basis  which means that the customer supplies the necessary materials  and we provide the labor and other services required for product assembly 
turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing  in addition to manufacturing  and involve greater resource investments than consignment services 
other than certain test equipment used for internal manufacturing  we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products 
industry sectors our business development efforts are focused on specific end markets as follows wireline networking the manufacture and design of electronic products and technologies that transmit and store voice  data and video electronically using wire conductors and or optical fibers

products include detection devices  secure data communications equipment  computers  vision systems and avionics systems 
executive summary our focus as we entered fiscal was to improve the company s profitability primarily by attaining profitable growth in revenues while improving operational efficiencies  including better management of working capital 
revenues in fiscal increased percent over the prior year  and gross margins  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  improved quarter over quarter throughout the fiscal year 
gross margins in the first half of the year were adversely affected by manufacturing inefficiencies and material control issues in our facility in juarez  mexico juarez 
in addition  we incurred anticipated start up losses associated with a new facility in penang  malaysia penang  which attained profitability only later in the fiscal year 
profitability was enhanced by the economies of scale associated with higher revenues than in the prior year  as well as the continued application of lean manufacturing initiatives 
better inventory management allowed us to increase revenues without substantially increasing inventory levels  and inventory turnover increased to from the prior year s we also negotiated more favorable payment terms with many of our suppliers  which increased accounts payable balances and improved our cash conversion cycle 
our focus on improving working capital management allowed us to finance revenue growth internally and still generate positive cash flows from operations resulting in a million increase in cash and short term investments 
as we enter fiscal  we are encouraged by the improved operational metrics achieved in the prior year 
our goal is to continue to improve financial performance and to earn an after tax return on capital employed greater than our estimated percent weighted average cost of capital 
this  we believe  can be achieved by expanding operating margins and accelerating our capital employed turnover through further improvements in the management of working capital 
based on customer indications of expected demand and management estimates of new program wins  our internal projections currently anticipate full fiscal sales growth of approximately percent to percent 
we currently expect first quarter of fiscal sales to be in the range of million to million  however  our results will ultimately depend on the actual levels of customer orders 
facility closures acquisitions in fiscal  we closed our bothell engineering and manufacturing facility and transitioned the remaining customer programs to other plexus sites 
in fiscal  we purchased a second manufacturing facility in penang  which commenced manufacturing activities in the first quarter of fiscal the expansion was driven by additional demand from our customers for more production in this relatively low cost country 
in fiscal  we closed our pcb design operations in hillsboro  oregon hillsboro and announced plans to close our bothell facility in fiscal in addition  we sold a small pcb design operation in tel aviv  israel to a group of former employees  however  this transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we closed our manufacturing facilities in san diego  california san diego and richmond  kentucky richmond  and ceased production in our oldest facility in neenah  wisconsin neenah 
in addition  we sold our pcb design operations in nashua  new hampshire to a group of former employees  however  this transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  net sales 
table of contents net sales for the fiscal year ended october  increased percent from the year ended september  the increase reflects increased growth in all sectors  particularly in the wireless infrastructure  wireline networking  industrial and medical sectors 
the net sales growth in the wireline networking and medical sectors was primarily associated with juniper and ge  respectively  our largest customers 
net sales growth in the wireline networking sector is expected to continue in fiscal based on current customer forecasts and the expected start up of new programs 
in the medical sector  we anticipate that net sales may decline in fiscal due largely to uncertainty over future manufacturing for a key customer in the united kingdom see further discussion below under fiscal restructuring and impairment costs goodwill impairment 
the growth in the wireless infrastructure and industrial sectors reflect new program wins from both new and existing customers 
based on current customer forecasts  we anticipate that net sales in the industrial sector will be relatively flat in fiscal although we achieved fiscal net sales growth in the wireless infrastructure sector  a key end customer of one of our customers in this sector recently exercised an option to manufacture some of our customer s product 
the impact of this event on us is unknown  however  the event prompts a less optimistic outlook for the wireless infrastructure sector in the first half of fiscal in the defense security aerospace sector  we obtained new programs during fiscal  which we anticipate will result in fiscal net sales growth in this sector as we move beyond start up production for these new customers 
net sales for the fiscal year ended september  increased percent from the year ended september  the increase reflects strengthened end market demand in the wireline networking  wireless infrastructure  medical and defense security aerospace sectors  as well as new program wins from both new and existing customers in all sectors 
net sales growth in the wireline networking sector was primarily associated with juniper  our largest customer 
the industrial commercial sector remained relatively flat due to weakened end market demand from one customer 
the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended october  september  september  juniper networks general electric siemens top customers represents less than percent of net sales sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of program commencements  terminations  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued sales to our significant customers  and our customer concentration has increased during the year 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers forecasts can and do change as a result of their fluctuating end market demand and other factors 
any material change in orders from these major accounts  or other customers  could materially affect our results of operations 
for example  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for matters which could affect our future sales to a significant customer in the united kingdom 
in addition  as our percentage of sales to customers in a specific industry becomes larger relative to other industries as we are currently experiencing in the wireline networking industry  we will become increasingly dependent upon economic and business conditions affecting that industry 

table of contents our net sales by industry for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended october  september  september  wireline networking wireless infrastructure medical industrial commercial defense security aerospace for our significant customers  we generally manufacture product in more than one location 
net sales to juniper  our largest customer  occur in our operating segments in the united states and asia 
net sales to ge  a major customer  occur in our segments in the united states  asia and mexico 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for certain financial information regarding our operating segments  including a detail of net sales by operating segment 
gross profit 
gross profit and gross margins for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  gross profit gross margin for the fiscal year ended october   gross profit improvements were primarily due to higher net sales and improved operating performances at several sites arising from lean manufacturing and other cost reduction initiatives 
gross profit and gross margin improvements were moderated  however  as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies and material control issues in our juarez facility 
lower sales from traditionally higher margin engineering services  and anticipated start up costs related to a new facility in penang also negatively impacted gross profit and gross margin in fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   the improvement in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to higher net sales and the benefits of the prior year s restructuring actions that resulted in enhanced manufacturing capacity utilization 
the primary fiscal restructuring actions benefiting fiscal gross margins included the closures of the san diego and richmond facilities 
the gross profit and gross margin improvements were partially offset  however  by manufacturing inefficiencies related to the start of many new programs  higher compensation and benefits costs  including variable incentive compensation  and increased amortization of capitalized costs associated with our common erp platform 
gross margins reflect a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product and service mix  the level of new facility start up costs  inefficiencies attendant to the transition of new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price erosion within the electronics industry  overall capacity utilization  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  the mix of turnkey and consignment business  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for our customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
additionally  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margins and net sales 
although we focus on expanding gross margins  there can be no assurance that gross margins will not decrease in future periods 
most of the research and development we conduct is paid for by our customers and is therefore included in both sales and cost of sales 
we conduct our own research and development  but that research and development is not specifically identified  and we believe such expenses are not material 

table of contents operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  selling and administrative expense percent of sales the dollar increase in s a for the fiscal year ended october  was due to a combination of factors including increased spending for internal and external resources to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  an increase in bad debt expense  in part due to a small customer that encountered a liquidity issue during fiscal  and the expense of additional personnel and other administrative expenses to support growth in asia 
these increases were offset in part by lower variable incentive compensation 
the decrease in s a as a percent of net sales was due primarily to the percent increase in net sales in fiscal over the prior year 
through fiscal  we accounted for stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board no 
 which resulted in no compensation expense in our consolidated results of operations 
effective in fiscal  we will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no r requires that we recognize stock based compensation as an expense in our results of operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition and will not affect consolidated cash flows  however  if stock options remain an important element of our long term compensation for directors  officers and key employees  sfas no 
r is expected to have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
based on unvested options outstanding at october   the future compensation cost to be recognized as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
r is approximately million  nearly all of which will be recognized in fiscal the dollar increase in s a for the fiscal year ended september  was primarily due to variable incentive compensation expense and additional expenses for the support of information technology systems related to the implementation of our common erp platform  offset  in part  by million of recoveries of accounts receivable that were either written off or reserved for in prior periods 
during fiscal  we devoted substantial internal resources in accounting  information technology and legal  supplemented by the use of external consultants  to the section compliance effort 
the significant decrease in s a as a percent of net sales was due primarily to the higher level of net sales over the prior year 
restructuring and impairment costs 
the following table summarizes our restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal   and dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  goodwill impairment lease exit costs and other asset impairments severance costs adjustments to lease exit costs adjustments to asset impairments total restructuring and impairment costs the restructuring and impairment costs were associated with various segments 
such costs are not allocated to operating segments  as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the operating segments 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for certain financial information regarding our operating segments  including a summary of restructuring and impairment costs by operating segment 
fiscal restructuring and impairment costs during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs totaling million 
the restructuring and impairment costs were associated with goodwill impairment  the closure of the bothell facility  the write off of the remaining elements of a shop floor data collection system  and other restructuring costs and adjustments to previously recognized restructuring and impairment actions 

table of contents goodwill impairment 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at a minimum on an annual basis  for which we selected the third quarter of each fiscal year  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded goodwill impairment of million  of which million represented a partial impairment of goodwill associated with our operations in the united kingdom our european operating segment and million represented a full impairment of goodwill associated with our operations in juarez our mexican operating segment 
as of october   we have remaining goodwill of million related to our operations in the united kingdom 
the impairment of goodwill associated with operations in the united kingdom arose primarily from a significant medical customer s recently expressed intention to transfer future production by the end of fiscal from the united kingdom to a lower cost location 
the impairment also reflects lowered expectations for the united kingdom s electronics manufacturing services industry  in general 
the impairment of goodwill associated with operations in juarez reflects a lowered forecast of near term profits and cash flows associated with recent operational issues and an anticipated transfer of a major customer s program to another plexus manufacturing facility 
in july  subsequent to our goodwill evaluation  our significant customer in the united kingdom referred to above announced that it was under investigation by the office of communication ooc  a government regulator in the united kingdom  and would postpone the further installation of its product in the united kingdom until the regulatory situation became clearer 
in september  the customer provided an updated announcement indicating that although the ooc s investigation was still continuing  the investigation had appeared to diminish in scope  which the customer viewed as an encouraging step toward a positive resolution of the investigation 
however  our future manufacturing for this customer remains uncertain 
bothell facility closure 
during fiscal  we incurred significant restructuring costs associated with the closure of the bothell facility 
we transferred key customer programs from the bothell facility a part of our united states operating segment to other plexus locations  primarily in the united states 
this restructuring reduced our capacity by  square feet and affected approximately employees 
we completed the closure of the bothell facility during fiscal as previously announced in fiscal 
during fiscal and  we incurred total restructuring and impairment costs associated with the bothell facility closure of approximately million  which consisted of the following elements million was recorded in fiscal and consisted of million for the facility lease  million for employee retention costs and million of other associated costs 
the liability for the facility lease was recognized and measured at fair value for the future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the property  million was recorded in fiscal and consisted of million for employee severance and million for fixed asset impairments 
shop floor data collection system impairment 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment of the remaining elements of a shop floor data collection system 
we had previously recorded a million impairment related to the shop floor data collection system in fiscal when it was determined that certain elements would not be utilized in any capacity 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we extended a maintenance and support agreement for the data collection system through july to provide additional time to evaluate the remaining elements of the system 
based on our evaluation  we determined that the shop floor data collection system was impaired 
we abandoned deployment of these remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system because the anticipated business benefits could not be realized 
these costs were not allocated to a specific geographic operating segment 
other restructuring costs 
during fiscal  we also recorded the following other restructuring and impairment costs million  which consisted of million associated with a workforce reduction and million of asset impairments at the juarez facility our mexican operating segment 
the juarez workforce reduction affected approximately employees  million for severance associated with the elimination of a corporate executive position 
these costs were not allocated to a specific geographic operating segment  
table of contents million for a planned workforce reduction at a facility in maldon  england maldon 
as noted above  a significant customer in the united kingdom intends to transfer future production from the united kingdom to a lower cost location by the end of fiscal as a result  we plan to consolidate the maldon manufacturing operations into our facility in kelso  scotland and focus the maldon facility on fulfillment and service and repair 
this transition is anticipated to be completed by the end of fiscal and will result in a net workforce reduction of approximately employees 
during the transition period  we anticipate additional restructuring costs in the amount of million to million  most of which relates to employee retention costs  million of other restructuring costs 
these costs were not allocated to a specific geographic operating segment 
adjustments to provisions during fiscal  we recorded certain adjustments to previously recognized restructuring and impairment costs 
all adjustments to provisions are associated with prior actions in the united states million additional expense related to additional impairment of the closed facility in san diego 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we subleased the remaining part of the san diego facility  which resulted in the additional impairment to adjust the carrying value of the remaining part of the san diego facility to its net present value of future sublease income  a million reduction in an accrual for lease exit costs associated with a warehouse located in neenah 
the neenah warehouse was previously abandoned as part of a fiscal restructuring action  however  we reactivated use of the warehouse in the second quarter of fiscal  a million reduction in an accrual for lease obligations for one of the closed facilities near seattle 
we subleased one of the two closed seattle facilities held under operating leases 
we currently expect that our fiscal restructuring actions will primarily benefit cost of sales through lower facilities costs and employee expenses 
fiscal restructuring and impairment actions during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs totaling million 
the restructuring and impairment costs were primarily associated with adjustments to previously recognized restructuring actions  specifically  additional lease obligations for two previously abandoned seattle facilities 
in addition  we incurred restructuring and impairment costs associated with the planned closure of our bothell facility  the write down of certain software and the closure of a satellite pcb design office in hillsboro  oregon 
adjustments to provisions the estimated cost for the closure of the seattle facilities was included in our fiscal restructuring actions 
the lease related restructuring costs recorded in fiscal were based on future lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less estimated sublease income 
as of september   the seattle facilities had not been subleased 
based on the remaining term available to lease these facilities and the weaker than expected conditions in the local real estate market  we determined that we would most likely not be able to sublease the seattle facilities 
accordingly  we recorded additional lease related restructuring costs of million in fiscal we also recorded million of lease related restructuring costs on a facility in neenah  which had also been included in restructuring actions in fiscal these adjustments were associated with our united states operating segment 
bothell facility closure in fiscal  we incurred restructuring and impairment costs related to the bothell closure of million  which consisted of million associated with employee terminations and million associated with fixed asset impairments 
our fiscal restructuring actions  combined with other factors  also led to the establishment of a million valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets in fiscal see discussion below 
shop floor data collection system impairment we recorded a million impairment of certain software components of our erp platform 
we determined that some elements of a shop floor data collection system would not be deployed because the originally anticipated business benefits could not be realized 
although we continued to evaluate the remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system into fiscal  an impairment of the remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system was taken in fiscal after the evaluation was complete 
these costs were not allocated to a specific geographic operating segment 

table of contents closure of a pcb design office we incurred approximately million of other restructuring and impairment costs in fiscal primarily related to the consolidation of the hillsboro satellite pcb design office into another plexus design office 
the hillsboro related restructuring costs were primarily for employee termination costs and contract termination costs associated with leased facilities and software service providers 
approximately employees were affected by this restructuring 
fiscal restructuring and impairment actions during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs of million 
these restructuring actions included the closure of the san diego and richmond facilities  and various other actions 
these measures were intended to align our capabilities and resources with lower industry demand 
san diego facility closure the san diego facility was closed in may the closure of the san diego facility resulted in a write off of remaining goodwill  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value  and costs relating to the elimination of the facility s work force 
building impairment charges totaled million 
during fiscal  goodwill impairment for san diego totaled approximately million  of which million was impaired as a result of a transitional impairment evaluation under sfas no 
see discussion below under cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill and million was impaired as a result of our decision to close the facility 
richmond facility closure the richmond facility was phased out of operation and sold in september customer programs were shifted to other plexus sites in the united states and mexico 
the closure of the richmond facility resulted in a write down of the building  a write down of underutilized assets to fair value  and costs relating to severance for the facility s work force 
building impairment charges related to richmond totaled million 
other restructuring and impairment costs other fiscal year restructuring and impairment actions included the consolidation of several leased facilities  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value and work force reductions  which primarily affected operating sites in juarez  seattle  neenah  and the united kingdom 
restructuring actions also impacted our engineering and corporate organizations 
employee termination and severance costs for fiscal were for approximately  employees 
these costs affected various operating segments 
as of october   we have a remaining restructuring liability of approximately million  of which million is expected to be paid in fiscal the remaining million of accrued liabilities is expected to be paid through october cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
for the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 we performed impairment tests on the net goodwill and other intangible assets associated with each location using a valuation date as of october  we determined that a pre tax transitional impairment charge of million was required for goodwill associated with operations at san diego and juarez 
the impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  september  september  income tax expense benefit effective annual tax rate the reduction in fiscal income tax expense was primarily due to the inclusion of a million valuation allowance in the prior year s income tax expense see further discussion below 
fiscal income tax expense of million arose primarily from taxable income generated in the united kingdom 
our expanding operations in asia were profitable  however  those operations benefit from tax holidays which therefore resulted in no income tax expense for our asian operations 
our u 
s operations generated a pre tax loss  however  a full valuation allowance against such losses eliminated any associated us income tax benefit 
as a result of the continued availability of deferred income tax assets  together with tax holidays in asia  and if we are able to achieve our current profitability estimates  we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately percent to percent 

table of contents the increase in fiscal income tax expense was primarily due to establishing a million valuation allowance on all of our us federal and state deferred income tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be provided when it is more likely than not that the related income tax assets will not be utilized 
under sfas no 
 unless specific exceptions apply  historical operating results are a strong indicator of a company s ability to generate future taxable income 
as a result of the company having a net loss in the us for income tax purposes in fiscal  and  we established a full valuation allowance on our us deferred income tax assets in fiscal although this valuation allowance reduces the carrying value of our net deferred income tax assets  we may be able to utilize these deferred income tax assets in future profitable periods to reduce future tax obligations 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to the establishment of the valuation allowance in the prior year and the mix in tax jurisdictions in which income was earned 
the effective income tax rate increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the valuation allowance 
in july  a legislative body of the united kingdom enacted the finance act the finance act  which may limit the deduction of interest expense incurred in the united kingdom when the corresponding interest income earned by the other party is not taxable to such party 
we currently extend loans from a us subsidiary to a united kingdom subsidiary  which is affected by the finance act 
the finance act is effective for interest expense incurred by the united kingdom subsidiary on these loans arising or accrued after march  for the fiscal year ended october   we provided income tax expense for the full effect of the finance act on the non deductibility of this interest expense based on our discussions to date with the tax authorities in the united kingdom regarding the application of the finance act to our circumstances 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the jobs act see note was signed into law in the united states 
the jobs act includes a deduction of percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the jobs act 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations made in fiscal during fiscal  we did not repatriate any qualified earnings pursuant to the jobs act 
we have determined that million to million of existing foreign earnings will meet the requirements of the jobs act 
we are evaluating the potential repatriation of earnings in the amounts ranging from up to million and currently estimate that a repatriation of earnings in this range would result in income tax of up to approximately million or approximately percent of any amounts repatriated 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended october   compared to cash flows used in operating activities of and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily provided by increased accounts payable and higher accrued liabilities and earnings after adjusting for the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization expense and non cash asset impairments  these positive cash flow effects were offset  in part  by higher accounts receivable and inventory in support of higher sales 
our actual days sales outstanding in accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended october  decreased to days from days for the prior year  primarily as a result of stronger cash collections 
our inventory turns increased to turns for the year ended october  from turns for the year ended september  inventories increased million from september   primarily due to an increase in finished goods 
inventories increased as a result of certain new programs for which we maintain finished goods in support of our customers needs 
although net sales increased percent in fiscal  raw material levels at october  were relatively flat in comparison to the prior year end due to the establishment of certain new vendor programs 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended october  the primary investments included million for purchases of property  plant and equipment and million of net purchases of short term securities 
fiscal purchases of property  plant and equipment included million  million  million and million related to our us  asian  united kingdom and mexican operations  respectively 
property  plant and equipment purchases within the us included million related to our common erp platform 
during fiscal  we converted another manufacturing facility to the common erp platform  and now manage a significant majority of our net sales on the common platform 
as of october   net property  plant and equipment includes million related to the new erp platform 

table of contents we utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the principal sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal our actual level of capital expenditures for fiscal will depend on anticipated demand  but we currently expect to spend in the range of million to million  which includes approximately million to million for our asian operations 
we also plan to extend the common erp platform to the remaining plexus sites over the next two years  however  the conversion timetable for these remaining plexus sites and project scope is subject to change based upon our evolving needs 
our anticipated fiscal capital expenditures include approximately million to million of capital expenditures for the common erp platform 
cash flows provided by financing activities  totaling million for the year ended october   primarily represent proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by net payments on debt and capital lease obligations 
we have suspended further employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan as a result of sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and our secured revolving credit facility as amended  the secured credit facility  allows us to borrow up to million from a group of banks 
borrowing under the secured credit facility may be either through revolving or swing loans or letters of credit 
the secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic working capital assets and a pledge of percent of the stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest on borrowings varies with our total leverage ratio  as defined in our credit agreement  and begins at the prime rate as defined in the agreement or libor plus percent 
we also are required to pay an annual commitment fee of percent of the unused credit commitment 
the secured credit facility matures on october  and includes certain financial covenants customary in agreements of this type 
these covenants include a minimum adjusted ebitda  a maximum total leverage ratio not to exceed times adjusted ebitda for the trailing four quarters and a minimum tangible net worth  all as defined in the agreement 
the secured credit facility includes a definition of adjusted ebitda to exclude any impairment charges that may arise from time to time in our assessment of our goodwill 
the exclusion of impairment charges from the adjusted ebitda definition arose from a request made by us in connection with our annual evaluation of goodwill under sfas no 
 which occurs for plexus in the third quarter of each fiscal year 
for the third quarter of fiscal  we identified million of impairment losses related to our juarez and united kingdom operations see fiscal restructuring and impairment costs above 
we are allowed to repurchase common shares and pay cash dividends as long as we remain in compliance with the various covenants 
we may not be able to arrange similar amendments in the future in order to accommodate changes or developments in our business or operations 
we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  cash and short term investments  the secured credit facility and leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements  as noted above  through fiscal although our net sales growth anticipated for fiscal will increase our working capital needs  we currently do not anticipate having to utilize our secured credit facility to finance this growth 
as our financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
we  therefore  evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our capital resources 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future

contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet obligations our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october  in thousands 
table of contents payments due by fiscal period and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities on the balance sheet other long term liabilities not on the balance sheet total contractual cash obligations as of october   operating lease obligations include future payments related to accrued lease costs attendant various restructurings 
fiscal payments include million related to accrued lease costs  which are included in accrued other liabilities on the balance sheet 
fiscal payments and beyond include million  which are included in other long term liabilities on the balance sheet 
as of october   purchase obligations consist of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business 
as of october   other long term obligations on the balance sheet include deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers and other key employees and accrued lease costs attendant various restructurings 
fiscal payments and beyond exclude million associated with accrued lease costs attendant various restructurings  however  such amount is excluded from this category in the above table due to the inclusion of such payments in the operating lease obligation category of the above table as noted in footnote 
as of october   other long term obligations not on the balance sheet consist of a commitment for salary continuation in the event employment is terminated for an executive officer of the company 
we did not have  and were not subject to  any lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations  other off balance sheet arrangements or other commercial commitments 
disclosure about critical accounting policies our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended october   there were no material changes to these policies 
our more critical accounting policies are noted below impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of additional asset impairments recorded in fiscal intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was effective october   we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but instead we test those assets for impairment  at least annually  and recognize any related losses when incurred 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment has occurred 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of million of goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal we measure the recoverability of goodwill under the annual impairment test by comparing a reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the reporting unit s estimated fair market value  which is primarily estimated 
table of contents using the present value of expected future cash flows  although market valuations may also be employed 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or customers and unforeseen reductions in customer demand  future operating performance or industry demand 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services are generally recognized upon shipment of the manufactured product to our customers under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
upon shipment  title transfers and the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
net sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts of twelve months or less duration  are recognized as costs are incurred utilizing a percentage of completion method  any losses are recognized when anticipated 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
restructuring costs from fiscal through fiscal  we have taken a number of actions and recorded restructuring costs in response to reductions in sales and or reduced capacity utilization 
these restructuring costs included employee severance and benefit costs  and costs related to plant closings  including leased facilities that were abandoned and subleased  as applicable 
prior to january   severance and benefit costs and lease exit costs were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf the estimated lease loss was accrued for future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income 
as of october   we have one significant facility in seattle remaining to be subleased 
if we are able to sublease the remaining seattle facility  we would record a favorable adjustment to restructuring costs  as we did in fiscal  when we recorded a million favorable adjustment to restructuring costs as a result of entering into a sublease for one of the seattle facilities 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of additional restructuring costs recorded in fiscal subsequent to december   costs associated with a restructuring activity are recorded in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the timing and related recognition of recording severance and benefit costs that are not presumed to be an ongoing benefit  as defined in sfas no 
 depend on whether employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and  if so  whether employees will be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period 
during fiscal  we concluded that we had a substantive severance plan based upon our past severance practices  therefore  we recorded certain severance and benefit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits  which resulted in the recognition of a liability as the severance and benefit costs arose from an existing condition or situation and the payment was both probable and reasonably estimated 
for leased facilities abandoned and subleased  a liability is recognized and measured at fair value for the future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the property 
for contract termination costs  including costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity  a liability for future remaining payments under the contract is recognized and measured at its fair value 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of a lease liability recorded in fiscal associated with the closure of our bothell facility 
the recognition of restructuring costs requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
if our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  which would result in recording additional restructuring costs or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained  no additional accruals are required and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 

table of contents income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
although we recorded a million valuation allowance against all us deferred income tax assets in fiscal  we may be able to utilize these deferred income tax assets to offset future taxable income in the us new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  which requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we will be required to adopt this statement in the first quarter of our fiscal we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  fasb issued staff position fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act became law in the us in october this legislation provides for a number of changes in us tax laws 
fsp sfas no 
requires recognition of a deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the excess of book over tax basis of an investment in a foreign corporate venture that is permanent in duration  unless a company firmly asserts that such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the company s home jurisdiction 
however  due to the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the act  fsp sfas no 
provides companies additional time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
we are presently reviewing this new legislation  in conjunction with income tax legislation enacted in july in the united kingdom  to determine the impacts on our consolidated results of operations and financial position see income taxes above 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and this statement requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the grant date with limited exceptions and recognition of the compensation expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the application of sfas no 
r 
among other things  sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in our first quarter of fiscal currently  we account for stock option awards under the provisions of apb no 
 which to date has not resulted in compensation expense in our consolidated results of operations 
we have selected a transition method in which prior period financial statements would not be restated 
in addition  we will use the black scholes valuation model  which is the same valuation model we use to value stock options for pro forma presentation of income and per share data for sfas no 
disclosure purposes see note in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition and will not affect consolidated cash flows  however  if stock options remain an important element of long term compensation for our officers and key employees  sfas no 
r is expected to have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
based on unvested options outstanding as of october   the future compensation expense to be recognized as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
r is million in fiscal and nominal amounts in each of fiscal and note new accounting pronouncements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 
 which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
under sfas  if a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets meets a commercial substance criterion and the fair value is determinable  the transaction must be accounted for at fair value resulting in recognition of any gain or loss 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the first quarter of and our adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
we are required to adopt fin by the end of fiscal we are currently assessing the impact of fin on our results of operations and financial condition

if we implement changes in accounting principles that are addressed by the standard or have corrections of accounting errors 
in june  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations  that provides guidance on how commercial users and producers of electronic equipment should recognize and measure asset retirement obligations associated with the european directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment weee 
weee primarily impacts our operations in the united kingdom 
fsp no is effective on the date that the united kingdom adopts weee into law  which is anticipated sometime in fiscal we are currently assessing the impact of fsp no 
on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risk factors our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the volume of customer orders relative to our capacity the level and timing of customer orders  particularly in light of the fact that some of our customers release a significant percentage of their orders during the last few weeks of a quarter the typical short life cycle of our customers products market acceptance and demand for our customers products customers announcements of operating results and business conditions changes in our sales mix to our customers business conditions in our customers industries the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes changes in cost and availability of labor and components local and regional events  such as holidays  that may affect our production levels health and disease issues which could affect local  regional or global markets credit ratings and securities analysts reports and changes in economic conditions and world events 
the ems industry is impacted by the state of the us and global economies and world events 
a slowdown in the us or global economy  or in particular in the industries served by us  may result in our customers reducing their forecasts 
the demand for our services could weaken  which in turn would impact our sales  capacity utilization  margins and financial results 
historically  we have seen periods  such as in fiscal and  when our sales were adversely affected by a slowdown in the wireline networking and wireless infrastructure sectors  as a result of reduced end market demand and reduced availability of venture capital to fund existing and emerging technologies 
these factors substantially influence our net sales and margins 
net sales to customers in the wireline networking sector have increased significantly in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of total net sales  making us more dependent upon the performance of that industry and the economic and business conditions that affect it 
our quarterly and annual results are affected by the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs and availabilities  and the degree of capacity utilization in the manufacturing process 

table of contents the majority of our sales come from a relatively small number of customers  and if we lose any of these customers  our sales and operating results could decline significantly 
sales to our largest customer for the fiscal year ended october  represented percent of our net sales  while net sales to our largest customer in the fiscal year ended september  represented percent of net sales 
one other customer for the fiscal year ended october  represented percent of our net sales 
sales to our largest customer for the fiscal year ended september  represented percent of our net sales 
we had no other customers that represented percent or more of net sales in any of the periods 
sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of our net sales for the years ended october   september  and september   respectively 
our principal customers have varied from year to year  and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels  if at all 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  or the loss of other major customers  could seriously harm our business  such as the fiscal goodwill impairment associated with our operations in the united kingdom that resulted from a significant customer s announced intention to transfer future production from our united kingdom facility to a lower cost location see note in notes consolidated financial statements 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
ems companies must provide rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond our control 
the success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer  or by a group of customers  could seriously harm our operating results 
such cancellations  reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  facility requirements  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross margins and operating results 
customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program 
we invest in technology to support our operations  developments may impair those assets 
we are involved in a multi year project to install a common erp platform and associated information systems at most of our manufacturing sites 
our erp platform is intended to augment our management information systems and includes various software systems to enhance and standardize our ability to globally translate information from production facilities into operational and financial information and create a consistent set of core business applications at our worldwide facilities 
as of october   facilities representing a significant majority of our net sales are currently managed on the common erp platform 
we plan to extend the common erp platform to our remaining sites over the next two years  however  the conversion timetable and project scope for our remaining sites is subject to change based upon our evolving needs 
during the year ended october   we recorded a million impairment related to the remaining elements of a shop floor data collection system 
we partially impaired the shop floor data collection system in the fourth quarter of fiscal when we determined that certain elements would not be utilized 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we extended a maintenance and support agreement for the data collection system through july to provide additional time to evaluate the remaining elements of the system 
based on our evaluation  and as part of the preparation of our financial statements  we determined that the shop floor data collection system was impaired 
we determined that we would abandon deployment of these remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system because the anticipated business benefits could not be realized 
as of october   overall erp investments included in net property  plant and equipment totaled million and we anticipate incurring up to an additional million to million of capital expenditures for the common 
table of contents erp platform in fiscal changes in our technology needs may affect the utility of our common erp platform and require additional expenditures in the future 
failure to manage contraction and growth  if any  may seriously harm our business 
periods of contraction or reduced sales  such as the periods that occurred from fiscal through  create challenges 
we must determine whether all facilities remain productive  determine whether staffing levels need to be reduced  and determine how to respond to changing levels of customer demand 
while maintaining multiple facilities or higher levels of employment increases short term costs  reductions in employment could impair our ability to respond to later market improvements or to maintain customer relationships 
our decisions to reduce costs and capacity  such as the fiscal closure of our bothell facility and the related reduction in the number of employees  can affect our expenses and  therefore  our short term and long term results 
due to continued growth in fiscal and the rapid sales growth which occurred in fiscal  we needed additional employees and facilities to meet incremental demand 
in fiscal  we began the expansion of our operations in penang  malaysia and added many employees  principally in asia 
these actions resulted in additional costs to support our growth 
if we are unable to effectively manage the growth currently anticipated for fiscal  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  to meet our customers needs  or to achieve increased efficiencies  we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another 
we are currently evaluating further expansion alternatives in asia 
since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly  we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location while incurring the costs of expansion in another location 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks  including foreign currency risks 
we have operations in china  malaysia  mexico and the united kingdom 
as noted above  we expanded our operations in malaysia  and we may in the future expand in these or into other international locations 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations 
we also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries 
these international aspects of our operations subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operating results economic or political instability transportation delays or interruptions and other effects of the less developed infrastructure in many countries foreign exchange rate fluctuations utilization of different systems and equipment difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel in diverse cultures and the effects of international political developments 
in fiscal  the chinese and malaysian governments revalued their currencies against the us dollar 
both currencies had been relatively fixed to the us dollar for the last several years  but both governments now appear to have adopted policies described as managed floats that is  allowing their currencies to move in a tight range up or down from the previous day s close 
as our asian operations expand  our failure to adequately hedge foreign currency transactions and or currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  changes in policies by the us or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties  tariffs  taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers 
for example  our facility in mexico operates under the mexican maquiladora program  which provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations  we could be adversely affected by changes in that program 
also  the malaysian and chinese subsidiaries currently receive favorable tax treatments from these governments which extend for approximately years and years  respectively  which may or may not be renewed 

table of contents we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel maintain and enhance our technological capabilities develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
our manufacturing services involve inventory risk 
most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis  under which we purchase some  or all  of the required materials 
accordingly  component price increases and inventory obsolescence could adversely affect our selling price  gross margins and operating results 
in our turnkey operations  we need to order parts and supplies based on customer forecasts  which may be for a larger quantity of product than is included in the firm orders ultimately received from those customers 
customers cancellation or reduction of orders can result in additional expense to us 
while most of our customer agreements include provisions that require customers to reimburse us for excess inventory specifically ordered to meet their forecasts  we may not actually be reimbursed or be able to collect on these obligations 
in that case  we could have excess inventory and or cancellation or return charges from our suppliers 
in addition  we provide managed inventory programs for some of our key customers under which we hold and manage finished goods inventories 
these managed inventory programs may result in higher finished goods inventory levels  further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers 
even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us  we may remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations 
we may not be able to obtain raw materials or components for our assemblies on a timely basis  or at all 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the components used in the assembly process 
we do not have any long term supply agreements 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components that we use  and suppliers of some components have lacked sufficient capacity to meet the demand for these components 
at times  component shortages have been prevalent in our industry  and such shortages may be expected to recur from time to time 
in some cases  supply shortages and delays in deliveries of particular components have resulted in curtailed or delayed production of assemblies  which contributed to an increase in our inventory levels 
an increase in economic activity could result in shortages  if manufacturers of components do not adequately anticipate the increased orders and or have previously excessively cut back their production capability in view of reduced activity in recent years 
world events  such as terrorism  armed conflict and epidemics  could also affect supply chains 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient components on a timely basis  we may experience manufacturing and shipping delays  which could harm relationships with our customers and reduce our sales 
while most of our customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such repricings or  if such repricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents start up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results 
the management of labor and production capacity in connection with the establishment of new programs and new customer relationships  and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross margins and operating margins 
these factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life cycle of new products and new programs or program transfers 
the effects of these start up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we open new facilities  such as our new facility in penang  malaysia  which began production in the first quarter of fiscal  or when we transfer programs  such as those made in connection with the fiscal closure of our bothell facility 
customer needs  capacity utilization rates and or increased demand may require that we expand certain facilities  or seek larger facilities in fiscal  or future years 
we are currently managing a number of new programs 
consequently  our exposure to these factors has increased 
in addition  if any of these new programs or new customer relationships were terminated  our operating results could worsen  particularly in the short term 
although we try to minimize the potential losses of transitioning customer programs between plexus facilities  there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in the disruption of programs and customer relationships 
we and our customers are subject to extensive government regulations 
we are subject to environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  recycling and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of business 
these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur significant expense 
while we are not currently aware of any material violations  we may have to spend funds to comply with present and future regulations or be required to perform site remediation 
our medical device business  which represented approximately percent of our net sales in fiscal  is subject to substantial government regulation  primarily from the federal fda and similar regulatory bodies in other countries 
we must comply with statutes and regulations covering the design  development  testing  manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety 
failure to comply with these regulations can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  criminal prosecution  recall or seizure of devices  or total or partial suspension of production 
the fda also has the authority to require repair or replacement of equipment  or refund of the cost of a device manufactured or distributed by our customers 
violations may lead to penalties or shutdowns of a program or a facility 
failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation 
in addition  our customers failure to comply with applicable regulations or legal requirements  or even allegations of such failures  could affect our sales to those customers 
for example  as discussed in note in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  a significant customer in the united kingdom is under investigation by the office of communication  a government regulator in the united kingdom 
even though our manufacturing services are not implicated in this investigation  it has delayed installations of the product and reduced our sales to that customer 
in addition  there are two european union eu directives which could affect our business and results 
the first of these is the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances rohs 
rohs becomes effective on july   and restricts within the eu the distribution of products containing certain substances  lead being the most relevant restricted substance to us 
although most of the eu member countries have not yet turned the mandates into legislation  it appears that we will be required to manufacture rohs compliant products for customers intending to sell into the eu after the effective date 
in addition  industry analysts indicate that similar legislation in the us and asia will eventually follow 
the second eu directive is the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive  effective in august  under which a manufacturer or importer will be required  at its own cost  to take back and recycle all of the products it either manufactured in or imported into the eu 
since both of these directives affect the worldwide electronics supply chain  we expect to make collaborative efforts with our suppliers and customers to develop compliant processes and products 
the cost of such efforts  the degree to which we will be expected to absorb such costs  the impact that the directive may have on product shipments  and our liability for non compliant product is not yet known  but could have a material effect on our operations and results 

table of contents in recent periods  our sales related to the defense security aerospace sector have begun to increase 
companies that design and manufacture for this sector face governmental  security and other requirements that could materially affect their financial condition and results of operations 
products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications that are highly complex and may at times contain design or manufacturing defects 
defects have been discovered in products we manufactured in the past and  despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts  defects may occur in the future 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component defect  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects occur in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may also be tarnished 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us 
even if customers are responsible for the defects  they may or may not be able to assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us and we occasionally incur costs defending claims 
our products are for the electronics industry  which produces technologically advanced products with relatively short life cycles 
factors affecting the electronics industry  in particular the short life cycle of products  could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards that result in short product life cycles the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance 
our business in the wireline networking and wireless infrastructure sectors could be slowed by further government regulation of the communications industry 
the end markets for most of our customers in the wireline networking and wireless infrastructure sectors are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission  as well as by various state and foreign government agencies 
the policies of these agencies can directly affect both the near term and long term consumer and provider demand and profitability of the sector and therefore directly impact the demand for products that we manufacture 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or reduced prices for our services 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive and has become more so as a result of excess capacity in the industry 
we compete against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations  as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
consolidations and other changes in the electronics manufacturing services industry result in a continually changing competitive landscape 
the consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors that may have significantly greater resources with which to compete against us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic and market presence be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
as a result  
table of contents competitors may have a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced sales and margins or loss of market share 
we depend on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel may harm our business 
our success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of existing products 
the competition for these individuals is significant  and the loss of key employees could harm our business 
expansion of our business and operations may negatively impact our business 
we have expanded our presence in malaysia and may further expand our operations by establishing or acquiring other facilities or by expanding capacity in our current facilities 
we may expand both in geographical areas in which we currently operate and in new geographical areas within the united states and internationally 
we may not be able to find suitable facilities on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us 
expansion of our business and operations involves numerous business risks  including the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or capacity and to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value additional fixed costs which may not be fully absorbed by the new business difficulties in the timing of expansions  including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans creation of excess capacity  and the need to reduce capacity elsewhere if anticipated sales or opportunities do not materialize diversion of management s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions strain placed on our operational  financial  management  technical and information systems and resources disruption in manufacturing operations incurrence of significant costs and expenses inability to locate sufficient customers or employees to support the expansion 
our operations could be negatively affected by an epidemic 
we have a production facility in xiamen  china  which is one of the countries that have been most at risk in the current outbreak of avian flu 
we also operate in malaysia  which is in the area in which avian flu has spread 
to the best of our knowledge  concerns about the spread of avian flu have not affected our employees or operations in china or malaysia  nor have we experienced any disruption in our supply chain as a result of these concerns 
however  our production in asia could be severely impacted by an epidemic spread of avian flu or a similar widespread disease or epidemic 
our facilities could be closed by government authorities  some or all of our workforce could be unavailable due to quarantine  fear of contagion or other factors  and transportation or other elements of the infrastructure could be affected  leading to delays or loss of production 
concerns relating to avian flu are currently limited to asia  however  avian flu or other outbreaks of disease or epidemics could similarly affect our other facilities 
these health related factors could also affect our suppliers and lead to a shortage of components 
they could also lead to a reduction in end customer demand 
we may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses  which could adversely affect our operating results 
although we have previously grown through acquisitions  our current focus is on pursuing organic growth opportunities 
if we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions  however  this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us 
these risks include 
table of contents operating risks  such as the inability to integrate successfully our acquired operations businesses and personnel inability to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value difficulties in scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites strain placed on our personnel  systems and resources possible modification or termination of an acquired business s customer programs  including cancellation of current or anticipated programs loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
financial risks  such as the use of cash resources  or incurrence of additional debt and related interest expenses dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities inability to achieve expected operating margins to offset the increased fixed costs associated with acquisitions  and or inability to increase margins at acquired entities to plexus desired levels incurrence of large write offs or write downs impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses 
we may fail to secure or maintain necessary financing 
we maintain a secured credit facility with a group of banks  which allows us to borrow up to million depending upon compliance with related covenants and conditions 
however  we cannot be sure that the secured credit facility will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to amend the secured credit facility or revise covenants  if necessary or appropriate in the future  to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations 
our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support increased sales and our possible future growth 
we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock or other equity securities issuing debt securities modifying existing credit facilities or obtaining new credit facilities a combination of these methods 
we may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it  and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we issue additional equity securities or convertible debt to raise capital  it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests 
furthermore  any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business  such as restrictive financial or operating covenants  and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance  which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations have increased our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  the sec and the nasdaq stock market have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects 
these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and accounting costs  most significantly in fiscal  which was our first year of compliance 
we expect our compliance costs to continue  however  absent significant changes in related rules which we cannot assure  we anticipate these costs may be lower in future years as we become more efficient in our compliance processes 

table of contents if we reach other than an affirmative conclusion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as required by the section of the sarbanes oxley act  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k  that report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the public accounting firm auditing a company s financial statements must attest to and report on both management s assessment as to whether the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in fiscal  we will continue a comprehensive effort to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are unable to complete our assessment in a timely manner or if we and or our independent auditors determine that there are material weaknesses regarding the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of events and factors relating to us  our competitors and the market for our services  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and especially the nasdaq stock market  along with share prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility  including weakness  that sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
our stock price and the stock price of many other technology companies remain below their peaks 
among other things  volatility and weakness in plexus stock price could mean that investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they paid 
volatility and weakness could also impair plexus ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
presently  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
as of october   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal year net sales total costs 
table of contents interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions 
we currently do not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk is associated with our secured credit facility 
a percent change in our weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on net interest expense in fiscal  and
