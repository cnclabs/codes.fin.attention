overview we are the leading provider of onshore seismic data acquisition services in the united states as measured by the number of active data acquisition crews 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients  mainly domestic oil and gas companies 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these oil and gas companies for exploration  production  development and field management activities  which activities depend  in part  on oil and natural gas prices 
fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected the demand for our services and our results of operations in years past and continue to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations 
accordingly  our return to profitability in fiscal after several years of losses is directly related to an increase in the level of exploration for domestic oil and natural gas reserves by the petroleum industry since the increased level of exploration is a function of higher prices for oil and natural gas 
as a result of the increase in domestic exploration spending  we have experienced an increased demand for our seismic data acquisition and processing services 
while the markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future and we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our market position by responding to our client s desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
while no increase in the company s crew count is currently anticipated  we continue to focus on increasing the revenues from and profitability of our existing crews by upgrading our recording capacity  expanding the channel count on existing crews and adding to our energy source fleet 
while our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services  our revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity of our data acquisition crews  including factors such as crew downtime related to inclement weather  delays in acquiring land access permits  or equipment failure 
consequently  our successful efforts to negotiate more favorable weather protection provisions in our supplemental service agreements  to mitigate access permit delays and to improve overall crew productivity may contribute to growth in our revenues 
although our clients may cancel their 
table of contents supplemental service agreements with us on short notice  we believe we currently have a sufficient order book to sustain operations at full capacity well into calendar fiscal highlights our financial performance for fiscal significantly improved when compared to our financial performance for fiscal as a result of continuing high demand for our services due to increased exploration and development activity by domestic oil and gas companies and increases in oil and gas prices 
as a result of continuing high demand we added capacity to existing crews and fielded two additional data acquisition crews 
we continued to experience price improvements and more favorable contract terms in our agreements with clients 
these factors helped improve our revenues during fiscal we continued to grow by upgrading our recording capacity  expanding the channel count of existing crews  adding to our energy source fleet and making technical improvements in all phases of our operations 
we recognized income tax expense in fiscal as a result of our continued profitability 
in march we successfully completed a public offering of  shares of common stock 
the offering raised net proceeds of approximately million that were used to fund our continued expansion and to repay borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
also  in august we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to enable us to act quickly as opportunities arise to enhance the capabilities of our operations 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of continuing high demand for our services 
as a result of continuing high demand  we were able to field two additional data acquisition crews  obtain price improvements in the markets for our services and negotiate favorable contract provisions 
we began fiscal with nine data acquisition crews 
the tenth crew was added in january and the eleventh crew was fielded in may operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to the start up and ongoing expenses of the two new data acquisition crews added during the year and the full year of service for the eighth and ninth crews fielded in the fourth quarter of fiscal general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal  the same as in fiscal the fact that our percentage of general and administrative spending was the same as in fiscal despite the significant increase in our fiscal total revenues reflects the increases in these expenses necessary to support expanded field operations and to comply with sarbanes oxley reporting requirements 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflecting the full year of depreciation expense from our fiscal capital expenditures 
our depreciation expense is also expected to increase in fiscal as a result of our significant capital expenditures in fiscal our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
our income tax expense was  in fiscal as compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal the fiscal expense was primarily due to recording income tax expense as a result of our continued profitability in the fiscal tax benefit was primarily due to a deferred income tax benefit from the elimination of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset generated from net operating loss carryforwards 
the fiscal current tax expense reflects alternative minimum tax amt calculated on net income not eligible for offset by amt credit carryforwards 
we anticipate we will recognize 
table of contents increased income tax expense in future years as we fully utilize our federal net operating loss nol carryforwards and amt credit carryforwards 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of increased demand for our services 
as a result of this increased demand  we were able to field three additional data acquisition crews  obtain price improvements in the markets for our services and negotiate favorable contract provisions 
we began fiscal with six data acquisition crews 
the seventh crew was added in march and the eighth and ninth crews were fielded in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately  of our revenue was related to a negotiated release from contract performance by one customer 
the release was at the request of the client and did not involve any performance issues 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to the start up and ongoing expenses of the three new crews added during the year 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the reduction in the percentage of general and administrative expenses to revenues in fiscal reflects our relatively fixed operating costs and the increase in our revenues during this period 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase to support expanded field operations and to assimilate sarbanes oxley reporting requirements 
in fiscal  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  in response to the increase in business activity and accounts receivable 
historically  we have had no significant write offs of trade accounts receivable  however  we believed that it was prudent to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts in response to the business from new customers that the increases in the prices of oil and natural gas have generated 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal approximately of the fiscal capital expenditures occurred in the fourth quarter 
during fiscal  we will reflect a full year of depreciation expense for these fourth quarter capital expenditures 
our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
because of our past five profitable quarters and the continued favorable environment for our services  we believed that we would be able to fully use our net operating loss carryforwards 
approximately per share of our reported earnings for fiscal resulted from a deferred income tax benefit resulting from the elimination of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset generated from these net operating loss carryforwards 
current tax expense reflects amt calculated on net income not eligible for offset by amt loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources introduction 
our principal sources of cash are amounts earned from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients 
our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services  including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment 
accordingly  our cash position depends as do our revenues on the level of demand for our services 
historically  cash generated from our operations along with cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  and to some extent  our capital expenditures 
in march we successfully completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
the offering raised net proceeds of approximately million that were used to fund our continued expansion and to repay borrowings under our revolving line of credit agreement 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal these amounts primarily reflect results of operations offset by changes in working capital components  depreciation and other non cash items  including deferred income tax expense 
the changes in our working capital components in fiscal resulted primarily from the increase in 
table of contents demand for our services during fiscal which led to increases in our accounts receivable  reflecting the increased revenues of our expanding business  and in our accounts payable  reflecting the costs to provide those services 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal these results primarily represent capital expenditures and activity in the short term investment portfolio 
capital expenditures were made with cash generated from operations and short term investments and during fiscal with cash from our revolving line of credit agreement and proceeds from the public stock offering discussed below 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  and primarily reflects proceeds from the public stock offering 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures during fiscal were  which we used to complete the outfitting of our eighth and ninth data acquisition crews  to deploy our tenth and eleventh crews  to acquire additional recording channels and energy source units and for maintenance capital requirements 
while no increase in our crew count is currently anticipated  we have an approved initial capital budget of  for fiscal year to upgrade recording capacity  expand the channel count of existing crews  add to our energy source fleet  and make technical improvements in all phases of our operations 
these additions will allow us to maintain a competitive position as we respond to client desire for higher resolutions subsurface images 
we continually strive to supply our clients with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording systems and data processing capabilities 
we maintain equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased future demand for our services 
capital resources 
historically  we have primarily relied on cash generated from operations  cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  capital expenditures 
we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings 
as a result of our recent increased capital needs resulting from the continued expansion of our business  we obtained a million revolving line of credit agreement in december and completed a public offering of our common stock in march on december   we entered into a revolving line of credit loan agreement with western national bank under which we may borrow  repay and reborrow  from time to time until december   up to million 
our obligations under this agreement are secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable and related collateral 
interest on the outstanding amount under the line of credit loan agreement is payable monthly beginning on january  at a rate equal to the greater of i the prime rate or ii 
in connection with equipping and deploying our eighth and ninth data acquisition crews we borrowed million under the loan agreement on january   and the remaining million available under the loan agreement on february  as of march  we repaid the  balance outstanding under the loan agreement and the associated interest as a partial use of proceeds from our public offering of  shares of our common stock 
we did not borrow under the loan agreement during the remainder of fiscal the loan agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including limitations on distributions and dividends  disposition of assets and mergers and acquisitions 
we are also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the loan agreement  including maintaining a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the loan agreement of million and maintaining specified ratios with respect to cash flow coverage  current assets and liabilities  and debt to tangible net worth 
we expect to renew this revolving line of credit loan agreement for an additional year on the same terms and conditions 
in march we successfully completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million and were used to fund our continued expansion and to repay borrowings under our revolving line of credit agreement 
on august   we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering the offer and sale from time to time of up to million in debt securities  preferred and common 
table of contents stock  and warrants 
the registration statement allows us to sell securities  after the registration statement has been declared effective by the sec  in one or more separate offerings with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of sale 
the terms of any securities offered would be described in a related prospectus to be separately filed with the sec at the time of the offering 
we do not expect to make an offering at this time 
however  the filing will enable us to act quickly as opportunities arise 
the following table summarizes payments due in specific periods related to our contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period within after total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations we believe that our capital resources  including our short term investments and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our current operational needs 
we believe we will be able to finance our capital requirements through our short term investments and cash flow from operations  through borrowings under our revolving line of credit and from the remaining proceeds of the common stock offering discussed above 
however  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and to fund future capital requirements will depend principally upon our future operating performance  which is subject to the risks inherent in our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because of the use of assumptions and estimates inherent in the reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
these contracts are either turnkey or term agreements 
the company recognizes revenues when services are performed under both types of agreements 
services are defined as the commencement of data acquisition or processing operations 
under turnkey agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of data acquired rate  as services are performed 
under term agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of time worked rate  as services are performed 
in the case of a cancelled service contract  we recognize revenue and bill our client for services performed up to the date of cancellation 
we also receive reimbursements for certain out of pocket expenses under the terms of our service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenue at the gross amount including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 
in some instances  we bill clients in advance of the services performed 
in those cases  we recognize the liability as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we prepare our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our past experience of historical write offs  our current customer base and our review of past due accounts 
the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our customers 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the assets recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment charge is required if future expected net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
our forecast of future cash flows used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and future gross margins based on our historical results and analysis of future oil and gas prices which is fundamental in assessing demand for our services 
if we are unable to achieve these cash flows  our estimates would be revised potentially resulting in an impairment charge in the period of revision 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment 
our property  plant and equipment are capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
the technology of the equipment used to gather data in the seismic industry has historically evolved such that obsolescence does not occur quickly 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available these estimates could change 
we amortize these capitalized items using the straight line method 
tax accounting 
we account for our income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we determine deferred taxes by identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences  measuring the total deferred tax asset or liability using the applicable tax rate and reducing the deferred tax asset by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our methodology for recording income taxes requires judgment regarding assumptions and the use of estimates  including determining our annual effective tax rate and the valuation of deferred tax assets  which can create variance between actual results and estimates 
the process involves making forecasts of current and future years taxable income and unforeseen events may significantly affect these estimates 
those factors  among others  could have a material impact on our provision or benefit for income taxes 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with the accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  we do not record compensation for stock options or other stock based awards that are granted to employees or non employee directors with an exercise price equal to or above the common stock market price on the grant date 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for public entities that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the impact to our financial statements will be in the form of additional compensation expense upon the award of any stock options and unvested options outstanding 
the amount of the compensation expense we will recognize is dependent on the value of our common stock and the number of options we award 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes 
table of contents in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principles 
the statement requires the retroactive application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
does not change the guidance for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements or the change in an accounting estimate 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices which effect demand for and pricing of our services and interest rate fluctuations 
at september   we had no indebtedness 
our short term investments were fixed rate and we do not necessarily intend to hold them to maturity  and therefore  the short term investments expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
as of september   the carrying value of our investments approximates fair value 
we have not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently conduct business internationally  so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk
