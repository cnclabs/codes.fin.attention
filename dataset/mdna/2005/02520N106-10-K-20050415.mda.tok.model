item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking statements the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item of this report 
historical results set forth in selected financial information  the financial statements and supplemental data included in item and item and this section should not be taken as indicative of our future operations 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these include statements about our business outlook  assessment of market and economic conditions  strategies  future plans  anticipated costs and expenses  capital spending  and any other statements that are not historical 
the accuracy of these statements is subject to a number of unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  the following national  regional and local economic and business conditions that will  among other things  affect demand for residential lots  commercial parcels and multifamily housing the real estate industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment  consumer confidence  availability of financing and interest rate levels as well as other market conditions such as oversupply or reduction in demand for commercial  industrial or multifamily properties 
adverse changes in any of these conditions generally  or in the market regions where we operate  could decrease demand for our residential lots  commercial parcels and homes  which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
the ability of the general economy to recover timely from an economic downturn although the real estate business historically has been cyclical  it has not undergone an economic down cycle in a number of years 
this has led some people to assert that real estate prices may be inflated and may decline if demand weakens 
a decline in the prices for real estate could adversely affect our home and land sales revenues and margins 
availability and creditworthiness of tenants we are exposed to customer risk 
our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from our customers 
general economic conditions and an increase in unemployment rates could cause the financial condition of a large number of our tenants to deteriorate 
while no tenant in our wholly owned portfolio accounted for a significant amount of the annualized rental revenue of these respective properties at december   our financial position may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by our tenants  including bankruptcies  insolvencies or general downturns in business 
the availability of financing for both our customers and us our business and earnings are also substantially dependent on the ability of our customers to finance the purchase of our land or homes 
limitations on the availability of financing or increases in the cost of such financing could adversely affect our operations 
our business and earnings is also substantially dependent on our ability to obtain financing for our development activities as well as refinancing our properties mortgages 
increases in interest rates  concerns about the market or the economy  or consolidation or dissolution of financial institutions could increase our cost of borrowing  reduce our ability to obtain the funds required for our future operations  and limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures 
changes in competition  availability of financing  customer trends and market conditions may impact our ability to obtain loans to finance the development of our future communities 
adverse changes in the real estate markets  including  among other things competition with other companies we operate in a very competitive environment  which is characterized by competition from a number of other land developers 
actions or changes in plans by competitors may negatively affect us 
risks of real estate acquisition and development including our ability to obtain governmental approvals for development projects and to complete our current development projects on time and within budget our plans for future development of our residential communities can be affected by a number of factors including time delays in obtaining necessary government permits and approvals and legal challenges to our planned communities 
the agreements we execute to acquire properties generally are subject to customary conditions to closing  including completion of due diligence investigations which may be unacceptable  acquired properties may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investments  our estimates of the costs or repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be inaccurate  the development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources 
in connection with our development occupancy rates and rents at the newly completed property may not meet the expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable 
the development of our residential communities may be affected by circumstances beyond our control  including weather conditions  work stoppages  labor disputes  unforeseen engineering  environmental or geological problems and unanticipated shortages of or increases in the cost of materials and labor 
any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our residential communities 
ability to renew hud subsidy contracts and availability of federal funds on a timely basis to service these contracts as of december   we owned an equity interest in and managed for third parties and affiliates properties that benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes 
these programs  which are usually administered by hud or state housing finance agencies  typically provide mortgage insurance  favorable financing terms or rental assistance payments to the property owners 
as a condition of the receipt of assistance under these programs  the properties must comply with various requirements  which typically limit rents to pre approved amounts 
if permitted rents on a property are insufficient to cover costs  our cash flow from these properties will be negatively impacted  and our management fees may be reduced or eliminated 
ability to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost we may experience economic harm if any damage to our properties is not covered by insurance 
we carry insurance coverage on our properties of the type and in amounts that we believe is in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties 
we believe all of our properties are adequately insured 
however  we cannot guarantee that the limits of our current policies will be sufficient in the event of a catastrophe to our properties 
we may suffer losses that are not covered under our comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance policies 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur  we could lose capital invested in a property  as well as any future revenue from the property 
we would nevertheless remain obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
environmental and safety requirements our properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property 
in addition  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants and others if property damage or health concerns arise 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance wit h fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
other we could be hurt by the loss of key management personnel 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the efforts of our senior management 
our operations could be adversely affected if key members of senior management cease to be active in our company

critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which we refer to as gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies  which we consider criti cal in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters  which are inherently uncertain 
sales  profit recognition and cost capitalization community development land sales are recognized at closing only when sufficient down payments have been obtained  possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer  and acpt has no significant continuing involvement 
home sale revenues are recognized upon settlement with the homebuyers 
the costs of acquiring and developing land are allocated to our land assets and charged to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
the costs of acquiring the land and construction of the condominiums are allocated to these assets and charged to cost of sales as the condominiums are sold 
the cost of sales is determined by the relative sales value method  which relies on estimated costs and sales values 
residential and commercial land sales can be highly cyclical 
once development is undertaken  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to sell the various developed lots or condominiums in a timely manner 
failure to sell such lots and homes in a timely manner could result in significantly increased carrying costs and erosion or elimination of profit with respect to any development 
even though our cost estimates are based on outside engineers cost estimates  construction contracts and historical costs  our actual development and construction costs can exceed estimates for various reasons  including but not limited to unknown site conditions  rising prices and changes in government regulations 
any estimates of such costs may differ substantially from the actual results of such costs and reduce or eliminate the future profits with respect to any development 
the portion of interest allocated to land during the development and construction period is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
remaining interest costs are expensed 
the interest incurred on the land acquisition and construction loan is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
investment in unconsolidated partnerships the company accounts for investments in unconsolidated real estate entities that are not considered variable interest entities under fin in accordance with sop accounting for investments in real estate ventures and apb opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the company s investments in unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting consisted of general partnership interests in limited partnerships which own apartment properties in the united states and puerto rico  a limited partnership interest in two limited partnerships that own commercial properties in puerto rico  and a ownership interest in a limited liability company 
the company considers many factors in determining whether or not an investment should be recorded under the equity method  such as economic and ownership interests  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners 
income and losses are recognized in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements and any guarantee obligations or commitments for financial support 
impairment of long lived assets acpt carries its rental properties  homebuilding inventory  land and development costs at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our real estate assets are considered long lived assets under us gaap  we are required to evaluate whether the carrying amount of each of these assets will be recovered from their undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if the carrying value were to be greater than the undiscounted future operating cash flows  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount is not recoverable 
our estimates of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties  including  among others  demand for apartment units  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
up on determination that an impairment has occurred  the company records an impairment charge equal to the excess of the historical cost over fair value 
depreciation of investments in real estate we are required to make assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on our income statement on an annual basis 
our assessments  all of which are judgmental determinations  of our investments in our real estate assets are as follows buildings and improvements are depreciated over five to forty years using the straight line or double declining balance methods  furniture  fixtures and equipment over five to seven years using the straight line method leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or their estimated useful life  respectively 
maintenance and other repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
income taxes the company s tax structure is a complex one that involves foreign source income  multiple entities that do not file a consolidated return and multiple entities with different tax structures 
due to the complex nature of our tax structure  our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are frequently covered by insurance 
if it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is expensed in the financial statements 
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  we rely on the advice of our outside counsel as to the potential and probable outcome of these proceedings when evaluating any financial statement impact 
results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
it compares the components of the results of operations by segment for each of the three years ended december   and historically  the company s financial results have been significantly affected by the cyclical nature of the real estate industry 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future results 
this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
as more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements to correct our accounting treatment including the accounting for distributions in excess of basis from our unconsolidated entities  distributions in excess of basis to the minority owners in our consolidated entities and the consolidation of one limited partnership previously recorded under the equity method 
all financial information contained herein has been revised to reflect the restatements 
non gaap measures the following discussions refer to certain non gaap measurements  gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit is defined as land or home sales revenue less the related cost of sales and gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by sales revenue 
management uses these measures to compare a product s sales price in relationship to its cost when making product design and pricing determinations and evaluating the product s performance 
this measurement is not intended to be used as a replacement for sales revenue  cost of sales or net income 
gross profit excludes the following items included in the determinations of net income rental property revenue  rental operating expense  equity in earnings  management and other fees  interest income  interest expense  general  administrative  selling and market expense  depreciation and amortization  minority interest  write off of deferred project costs  other income  and income tax expense 
gross profit or gross margin does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  gross profit and gross margin should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
also  gross profit and gross margin  should not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined under gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
a calculation of gross profit and gross margin  for   and  along with a reconciliation to net income for each year  is provided in the following tables 
calculation of gross profit and gross margin is as follows us puerto rico total land sales revenue less cost of land sales gross profit on land sales gross profit on land sales land sales revenue gross margin on land sales home sales revenue less cost of home sales gross profit on home sales gross profit on home sales home sales revenue gross margin on home sales us puerto rico total land sales revenue less cost of land sales gross profit on land sales gross profit on land sales land sales revenue gross margin on land sales home sales revenue less cost of home sales gross profit on home sales gross profit on home sales home sales revenue gross margin on home sales us puerto rico total land sales revenue less cost of land sales gross profit on land sales gross profit on land sales land sales revenue gross margin on land sales home sales revenue less cost of home sales gross profit on home sales gross profit on home sales home sales revenue gross margin on home sales a reconciliation of gross profit to net income for the years ended december    and is as follows restated restated gross profit on land sales gross profit on homes sales rental property revenues rental operating expense management and other fees general  administrative  selling and marketing expense depreciation and amortization write off of deferred project costs interest and other income equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities interest expense minority interest in consolidated entities income tax expense net income results of operations us operations for the year ended december   our us segment generated  of operating income compared to  of operating income generated by the segment for the same period in and  in please review the discussion below for an analysis of our operating results 
community development us operations land sales revenue in any one period is affected by the mix of lot sizes and  to a greater extent  the mix between residential and commercial sales 
residential lots are sold to homebuilders in bulk pursuant to the terms of options contracts that are secured by cash deposits or letters of credit 
sales are closed on a lot by lot basis at the time when the builder purchases the lot 
residential lots can vary in size and location resulting in pricing differences 
gross profit margins of residential lots are fairly consistent within any given village in st 
charles 
commercial land is typically sold by contract that allows for a study period and delayed settlement until the purchaser obtains the necessary permits for development 
the sales prices and gross margins for commercial parcels vary significantly depending on the location  size  extent of development and ultimate use 
commercial land sales are cyclical and usually have a noticeable positive effect on our earnings in the period they reach settlem ent 
in march  the company executed an agreement with us home the homebuilding subsidiary of lennar corporation to sell  residential lots  single family lots and town home lots in fairway village 
the agreement requires the homebuilder to provide  in letters of credit to secure the purchase of the lots 
under the agreement  us home is required to purchase  at a minimum  residential lots  provided that they are developed and available for delivery  per year on a cumulative basis 
based on lot sales per year  it is estimated that lot settlements will take place over the next ten years 
compared to community development land sales revenue increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in residential land sales during  we sold standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  per lot compared to standard size single family lots which sold for an average sales price of  during the same period of the ultimate selling price per lot of our lot sales to us home may exceed the amount recognized at closing since the final lot price is equal to of the base price of the home sold on the lot 
additional revenue exceeding the initial price of  per lot will be recognized upon us home s settlement with the respective homebuyers 
the average selling price of the standard single family lot increased in compared to due to the fact that residential lots sold in were negotiated with homebuilders in and during a relatively flat housing market 
prices for our current residential lots reflect the healthy housing market and its upward trend in home prices 
the current selling price of town homes in this area is approximately  while singl e family homes in fairway village are selling in excess of  as of december   we did not have any developed residential lots available for delivery 
commercial land sales during  we sold acres of commercial land for per square foot compared to acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot for the same period in the average sales prices of these parcels differ due to their location  use and level of development 
as of december   our backlog contained of commercial acres under contract for a total of  gross profit the combined gross profit for the year ended december  increased to compared to for the same period of although the selling price of our residential lots increased in as compared to  our gross profit margin was affected by increases in the costs for the development of lots in fairway village 
our development costs have been directly affected by the increase in the price of steel  oil and fuel and the strong demand and limited supply for contractors st 
charles active adult community  llc land joint venture the company and us home formed a joint venture  st 
charles active adult community llc the aac whereby each member has an equal interest in the cash  earnings and decision making 
on september   the company transferred a parcel of land in the glen eagles neighborhood in fairway village with a cost basis of  to the joint venture for cash of  and a membership interest in the venture 
pursuant to an operating agreement  the joint venture will develop the property and sell it to the homebuilding company 
the company will serve as the managing agent for the project and will receive a management fee 
the company deferred revenues equal to the cash it received at closing and off site fees the joint venture is obligated to pay the company until the lots are sold by the joint venture to the homebuilder 
we expect minimal profit  if any  from the activities of the joint venture and expect to recognize the profit on the portion of land transferred as lots are sold by us home 
pursuant to the terms of the lot option agreement  lots are expected to begin selling in the third quarter of and will continue through the first quarter of the cost basis of the land is reflected in our investment in the joint venture within our community development assets compared to community development land sales revenue decreased in to  from  in residential land sales during  we sold standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  compared to standard size single family lots which sold for an average sales price of  small single family lots for an average sales price of  and town home lots for an average sales price of  during the same period of the decrease in residential lots sold during compared to is attributable to state mandated changes in storm water management regulations that forced us to reengineer our design plans  thus delaying the development and release of the next parcel of land in fairway village 
the sales price of the standard single family lot increased in pursuant to escalation provisions in the sales contracts and price increases 
at december  we had one single family lot in backlog  located inside the model park  at a base selling price of  we commenced development of the next parcel of land in fairway village that contains a total of lot s 
these lots were developed and ready for sale in the second quarter of commercial land sales during  we sold acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot compared to acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot for the same period in our commercial land sales included the sale of a seven acre parcel for retail use for per square foot  we did not have a comparable sale in the average sales prices of these parcels differ due to their location  use and level of development 
as of december   our backlog contained acres under contract for a total of gross profit the combined gross profit of our community development operations for decreased to from s gross profit of 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the use and location of our commercial and industrial land sold during the respective periods 
the gross profit in was also negatively impacted by the reduced sales volume of our residential and commercial land as well as an additional  of costs incurred related to a parcel of land sold in a prior year 
the decrease was offset by price increases for our fairway residential lots resulting in gross margins for those lots of in as compared to in during  the gross margins on the commercial parcels sold ranged from to compared to to earned in in  we closed on a seven acre parcel for retail use  which produced a gross margin due to its higher selling price and limited site improvements with no comparable sale in the period 
during  we sold six acres located i n our industrial parks developed in the s and s 
since that time  the county and state development requirements have continued to change requiring additional development to deliver the lots for final use 
the increased carrying costs and additional required development have eroded the profits resulting in a gross margin for those parcels 
rental property revenues and operating expenses us operations certain of the apartment properties in which we hold an ownership interest in the united states qualify for the consolidation method of accounting 
as a result  we include within our financial statements the consolidated apartment properties total revenue  and operating expenses 
the portion of net income attributable to the interests of the outside owners of some of these properties and any losses and distributions in excess of the minority owners basis in those properties is reflected as minority interest 
as of december   eleven of the consolidated properties are market rent properties  allowing us to determine the appropriate rental rates 
even though we can determine the rents  a portion of our units must be leased to tenants with low to moderate income 
hud subsidizes two of the properties and two properties are a mix of subsidized units and market rent units 
hud dictates the rents of the subsidized units 
apartment acquisitions on december   the company acquired of the limited partnership interests in bannister associates limited partnership bannister in conjunction with the refinancing of the property 
prior to the acquisition  the company s general partner interest in bannister was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the company completed the conversion of this property to a market rate property in on january   the company acquired a general partner and limited partner ownership interest in two partnerships that own apartment units coachman s limited partnership coachman s and village lake apartments limited partnership village lake 
on october   the company formed two wholly owned entities to acquire the assets of two apartment properties  owings chase llc and prescott square llc 
both are market rent properties  allowing us to determine the appropriate rental rates 
the following table presents the results of rental property revenues and operating expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands restated restated rental property revenues rental property operating expenses compared to rental property revenues increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in our fiscal year s rental property revenue results were affected by an overall rent increase of as well as increases generated from two of our properties as they converted from fully subsidized properties to a market rate property and an market rate property  respectively 
the remainder of increase  approximately  is the result of the apartment acquisitions made in october rental property operating expenses increased  in to  compared to  in the increase in our rental property operating expenses is the result of the apartment acquisitions made in october  which account for approximately  of the increase 
the remainder of the year s overall increase is due to increased insurance costs for all properties and increased repairs and maintenance expenses made to one of our properties during its conversion to an fair market property from a subsidized property 
compared to the overall increase in rental property revenues and operating expenses in is primarily the result of the consolidation of the three additional properties as described above 
on a comparable basis of properties between years  rental property revenues generated from the consolidated apartment partnerships operations for were  as compared to  for  while rental property operating expenses were  in compared to  in in  the increase in rental revenues resulted from a increase in rental rates  offset slightly by an increase in apartment vacancies 
our rental property operating expenses increased due to additional repairs and maintenance expenses incurred at our apartment property buildings as we pushed to improve the value of the properties during the fiscal year 
management and other fees us operations we earn monthly management fees from all of the apartment properties that we own as well as apartment properties owned by third parties and affiliates of j 
michael wilson 
we receive an additional fee from the properties that we manage for their use of the property management computer system that we purchased at the end of and a fee for vehicles purchased by the company for use on behalf of the properties 
the cost of the computer system and vehicles are reflected within depreciation expense 
this section includes only the fees earned from the non controlled properties  the fees earned from the controlled properties are eliminated in consolidation 
within this section we also recognize the amortized portion of sponsor and developer fees 
compared to management and other fees for the year ended december  increased to  compared to  for the same period in the  increase in our management fees is primarily due to the recognition of a  incentive management fee earned from one of our unconsolidated properties in with no comparable fee earned in  as well as the recognition of a  special management fee earned on the refinancing of huntington  one of our unconsolidated entities  with no comparable fee in the year to date increases were offset in part by our termination of a management contract with a non owned property in october compared to management and other fees earned for the year ended december  were  compared to  of fees earned in the fiscal year s decrease is result of  of management fees from bannister  coachman s and village lake recognized in but eliminated upon consolidation in as well as  of sponsor and developer fees recognized in and not in the decrease was offset in part by an increase in partnership rental revenue earned in two of the apartment properties that we manage and an increase in computer service income since the new software was in service for a full year in as compared to a partial year in general  administrative  selling and marketing expense us operations the costs associated with the oversight of our us operations  accounting  human resources  office management and technology  as well as corporate and other executive office costs are included in this section 
armc employs the centralized office management approach for its property management services for our properties located in st 
charles  maryland  properties located in pikesville  maryland and to a lessor extent the other properties that we manage 
the apartment properties reimburse armc for certain costs incurred at the central office that are attributable to the operations of those properties 
in accordance with eitf topic  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred the cost and reimbursement of these costs are not included in general and administrative expenses  but rather they are reflected as separate line items on the consolidated income statement 
in  our company maintained a policy of allocating corporate overhead charges incurred at the executive office to the puerto rico operations 
effective january   we no longer allocate these expenses to the puerto rico operations for reporting and management purposes 
compared to general  administrative  selling and marketing costs incurred within our us operations increased  in to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period of the increase in general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to additional staffing  consulting and audit fees required to meet the increased corporate governance and documentation requirements 
in addition we have expanded our staff to accommodate our expanded investment and property management supervision operations 
the current market for qualified employees is very competitive 
in order to fill open and new positions and retain current employees  we have incurred recruiting fees  salaries and bonuses in excess of our historical practices 
as a result salaries and benefits increased  in compared to salaries and benefits increased an additional  related to outstanding share incentive rights as a result in the improvement in the company s share price in compared to professional services fees including audit  tax compliance and legal fees increased  in compared to the remainder of the fiscal year s increase is the resul t of general inflation and additional donations made to local charities 
compared to general  administrative  selling and marketing costs incurred within our us operations increased in to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period of the year to date increase reflects additional compensation expense on incentive rights of approximately  as a result of the increases that we experienced in our share price this year 
the increase is also the result of an additional  of bad debt expense that we recorded in the current year on accounts receivable balances in two of our properties 
during the most recent fiscal year we saw an increase in other administrative costs such as general liability insurance premiums  and directors officers insurance premiums as a result of the escalating prices imposed by the insurance industry 
the remainder of the increase is composed of a rise in audit and legal fees as well as additional staffing hired in related to the increased corporate governance regulations for pu blic companies  as well as the absence in of a bad debt recovery compared to the  recovery in depreciation expense us operations compared to depreciation expense increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in as the result of a full year of depreciation expense recognized in from significant capital improvements made to our rental properties during the third and fourth quarters of depreciation expense in was also directly affected by the apartment acquisitions in october 
compared to depreciation expense increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in primarily due to the consolidation of the three additional properties in on a comparable basis  depreciation expense related to the rental properties increased approximately  as a result of capital improvements made to our consolidated properties as we increased their value and operating potential

debt guarantees and other obligations acpt and its subsidiaries typically provide guarantees for another subsidiary s loan or letters of credit 
in many cases more than one company guarantees the same debt 
all of these companies are consolidated and the debt or other financial commitment is included in acpt s consolidated financial statements 
these guarantees should not impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has been moderate in recent years 
in general  we attempt to minimize any inflationary effect by increasing our market rents  land prices and home prices 
however  in recent history  the increases in the hud subsidies have not offset the increase in the costs to insure  operate and maintain the properties  resulting in a negative impact on our cash flow 
intercompany dividend restrictions certain of our debt and regulatory agreements require us to abide by covenants which  among other things  limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions 
the regulatory agreements governing the apartment properties limit the dividend to annual or semi annual distributions of no more than surplus cash 
in addition  the distributions of the apartment properties are limited to a specified annual cumulative rate of return ranging from to 
lender approval is required prior to lda or torres making any cash distributions in excess of distributions to pay income taxes on lda s and torres generated taxable income  unless certain conditions exist that provide for adequate working capital for debt service and operations for the following twelve months 
these restrictions are not expected to impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
insurance and risk of uninsured loss we carry various lines of insurance coverage for all of our investment properties  including property insurance and believe that we are adequately covered against normal risks 
these policies  and other insurance policies we carry  have policy specifications  insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable 
we renewed our insurance coverage on may  for our puerto rico operations and october  for our us operations for one year policy terms 
although the insurance coverage provided for in the renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year  our premium costs increased overall by as compared to the prior term 
in november  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act tria which is designed to make terrorism insurance available 
in connection with this legislation  we have purchased insurance in the us for property damage due to terrorism 
our general liability policy provides tria coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our properties 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures  and the need to remediate such mold  is not a new phenomenon  there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects  including allergic or other reactions 
to help limit mold growth  we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture 
we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present 
however  we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner 
if a sig nificant mold problem arises at one of our properties  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 
we cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our apartment properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the use of financial instruments  such as debt instruments  subjects our company to market risks  which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets 
market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices 
we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
it is the company s policy to minimize the impact of variable rate debt to the greatest extent possible by pursuing equity and long term fixed rate financing and refinancings of current fixed rate debt at lower rates when favorable market conditions exist 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents the company s debt obligations  principal repayments  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair values 
the company has no derivative financial instruments 
we believe that the change in the fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a foreseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be immaterial to our total assets and total liabilities
