item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the strategic focus of our business is to deliver to our customers identity management and web services solutions and cross platform solutions  supported by services solutions that complement our products 
important factors in evaluating our fiscal year results include the state of the global economy and it markets and our progress in implementing key initiatives 
these initiatives include reducing the rate of revenue decline in our legacy netware business  increasing revenue from our linux and identity management businesses  and increasing sales of other products and services  including consulting services 
our initiatives and their implementation involve risks and challenges 
the following addresses our progress with these initiatives and their implementation during fiscal  as well as the risks and challenges we believe we face over the next year 
one of our most important strategies is to embrace the open source movement  specifically the linux operating system  and to develop a competitive position in the linux market 
this strategy includes supporting the linux operating system in addition to the netware operating system by offering novell products and services that run on both linux and netware platforms 
our acquisitions of ximian and suse  as well as restructurings in this and the prior fiscal year  are direct results of this strategy 
these acquisitions in particular enable us to offer a full range of enterprise solutions on the linux platform  from the desktop to the server to the mainframe 
we have completed the integration of ximian and have made significant progress with the integration of suse personnel  operations and technology into our business 
we expect that the benefits of the completed suse integration will not be fully realized until mid fiscal our key open source and linux goals include the following we need to successfully address the concerns of our netware installed base in order to eliminate historic revenue declines by providing a well articulated technology roadmap that is applicable for their businesses 
the installed base is an important source of cash flow and an opportunity for us to sell more products 
excluding the impact of foreign currency effects  netware revenue for fiscal declined by from fiscal it is our goal that the release of our open enterprise server oes product  which will include both the suse linux enterprise server sles and netware operating systems  will keep customers with novell 
oes is designed as a platform to allow our installed base to easily transition from netware to linux  should they choose to migrate 
our intention is that by providing customers with a clear migration path to our linux products  we mitigate the risk that customers may defect 
we released sles during fiscal  which we believe to be a major milestone in enabling enterprise linux computing 
we shipped approximately  sles units including  to a single customer during fiscal and  units of sles from the date of our acquisition of suse to the release of sles we also signed linux related enterprise wide agreements with three fortune customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal our belief is that sales of our suse linux products will increase as the market becomes more familiar with them 
in addition  we believe that our linux initiatives will help grow the linux market and provide sales opportunities for our other products 
as a result  we expect our existing product revenue streams and financial trends to benefit as the overall linux market grows in the future 
another important goal is to remove the barriers to adoption of linux at the enterprise level 
we believe that our experience providing enterprise level service  support  and products as well as other of our competitive advantages will allow us to become the leader in linux operating system distributions in a relatively short period of time 
we will continue to invest heavily in engineering  partnerships  novell annual report n 
table of contents support and training 
we are constantly evaluating our entire solution stack  and we will make  buy or license the appropriate technologies in order to provide a more complete  value add offering 
another goal is to expand our identity driven computing strategy 
we are in the process of componentizing delivery of identity management solutions so customers can implement a broader strategy in smaller modules  thereby reducing the time it takes to realize considerable business value and lowering their overall risk in adopting an enterprise wide identity strategy 
we believe that a primary driver of growth will be the demonstration of successful  small implementations that we can use as case studies and proof points 
in fiscal  we were able to turn our it consulting business around to profitability at the contribution margin level 
in fiscal  we plan to continue to profitably grow the it consulting business and to more closely align the it consulting engagements with the products we sell 
we still intend to offer general it consulting  but it will no longer be our primary focus 
we believe that we need to demonstrate to the consulting and systems integrator csi community that we are not direct competitors and show them how to use our products to develop identity solutions for their customers  with our help  when needed 
as we have noted above  we are still a company in transition  and there is much work that lies ahead 
although we continued to successfully cut costs in fiscal  reducing our work force and consolidating facilities  in fiscal we will need to maintain a transitional cost structure beyond that which a steady state business would require in order to develop  market and sell our products and solutions 
over the next to months  we expect to maintain current spending levels or to increase spending in the following areas we expect our research and development expenses as a percent of revenue will continue running higher than where we d like over the next year as a result of efforts to rearchitect several products such as zenworks  and edirectory so that they will appeal to customers outside the netware installed base and as a result of our ongoing investments in linux  partnerships and training 
last year  we commenced the transition of our north america sales force to a new business model as a result of our new products and repositioning 
we made significant progress during  and we estimate that this transition will be complete by the end of fiscal our emea business is in need of similar changes to those we have been making in north america 
we expect to begin that process in the first fiscal quarter of and expect the reorganization to last months 
to capitalize on linux interest  we have created a pan regional linux sales and business development group in north america and emea to help coordinate our activities 
critical to novell s performance over time is retaining and motivating our employees 
like many companies  we have significantly limited compensation changes over the past two years 
in  we plan to increase compensation  resulting in increased expense in both cost of sales and operating expenses 
cash flow from operations is our principal source of liquidity 
additionally  we have recently had net cash infusions of million from our private placement of senior convertible debentures in july and million from our settlement of certain netware related claims with microsoft in november our strong liquidity will help facilitate the implementation of this transition  as well to quickly respond to market developments and business opportunities that may arise 
despite recent improvements in the economy  we believe that we are still in a relatively soft it spending environment in north america 
although it demand trends appear to be slowly improving  we are seeing that cios are still cautious on it investments 
we see a continued reluctance to make large upfront commitments to infrastructure projects because they typically take long to complete and touch every part of the it architecture 
longer sales cycles are resulting in pilot rollouts that may or may not turn into orders 
similarly  the european economy remains flat and it budgets continue to be constrained in that region 
as a result  there was general weakness across all lines of our business in the emea region except for our suse linux novell annual report n 
table of contents products 
we believe that our focus on linux open source and identity management solutions will permit us to exploit the two primary concerns of cios security and total cost of ownership 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires us to make an accounting estimate based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially change the financial statements 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software licenses and maintenance  technical support  training  and consulting services 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
under sop  when an arrangement does not require significant production  modification or customization of the software  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require evidence of an agreement with a customer specifying the terms and conditions of the products or services to be delivered 
delivery has occurred for software licenses  delivery takes place when the customer is given access to the software programs 
for services  delivery takes place as the services are provided 
the fee is fixed or determinable fees are fixed or determinable if they are not subject to a refund or cancellation and do not have payment terms that exceed our standard payment terms 
collection is probable we perform a credit review of all customers with significant transactions to determine whether a customer is credit worthy and collection is probable 
revenue from software license fees is recognized upon delivery of the software 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
allowances for estimated sales returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenue 
we recognize revenue on the sale of shrink wrapped box product through our distributor channel on a sell through basis 
revenue from maintenance contracts  subscriptions  support and other similar services is recognized as services are performed over the term of the performance period 
certain sales require continuing service  support and performance by us  and accordingly  a portion of the revenue is deferred until the future service  support  and performance are provided 
consulting project contracts are either time and materials or fixed price contracts 
revenue from consulting projects is recognized only if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized using the proportional performance method  using estimated time to completion to measure the percent complete 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percent complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
many of our software arrangements include multiple elements  such as product upgrade protection  software support services  consulting  and training  in addition to software licenses and maintenance 
these multiple element arrangements are accounted for using the proportional method of accounting in which we allocate revenue to each element of the transaction based upon the relative fair values of the elements  which may include software products  product upgrade protection  software support services  consulting  and training 
fair value is determined by novell specific objective evidence of the price charged to other customers when novell annual report n 
table of contents each element is sold separately 
we have established sufficient novell specific objective evidence of the fair value of all elements of a multiple element arrangement 
services revenue includes reimbursable expenses charged to our clients 
we record provisions against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we also record a provision to operating expenses for bad debts resulting from customers inability to pay for the products or services they have received  due to such factors as bankruptcy 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and bad debt expense  analyses of credit memo data  and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or bad debts  revenue or net income could be overstated or understated 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets include net fixed assets  long term investments  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
at october   our long lived assets included million of net fixed assets  million of long term investments  million of goodwill  and million of identifiable intangible assets 
property  plant  and equipment 
we periodically review our property  plant  and equipment for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that our facilities in san jose  california and a small building in provo  utah had become impaired due to changes in the intended use of the facilities  as well as changes in the local commercial real estate market 
accordingly  an independent real estate consulting firm was retained to appraise the facilities 
this resulted in a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our san jose facility to a san jose based company looking to remain in the area and seeking to satisfy specific space requirements 
as a result  we were able to sell the facility for more than anticipated  and we recorded a million gain on the sale 
long term investments 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the actual financial performance of the companies or venture funds in which we have invested  the investees market value  and the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these private equity investments  we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees  liquidation preference value of the stock we hold  and estimated potential for investment recovery based on all these factors 
if any of these factors indicate that the investment has become other than temporarily impaired  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during fiscal  we recognized million of impairment losses related to our long term investments 
if general market conditions do not improve  or if any of the companies or venture funds included in long term investments do not meet performance goals  our investments could become other than temporarily impaired as their values decline  causing us to record further investment impairment charges 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
during the fourth quarters of fiscal  and  we completed our annual goodwill impairment review based on august   and balances and determined that there was no goodwill novell annual report n 
table of contents impairment as of those dates 
these assessments are made at the segment level  and therefore we could be subject to an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets if any one of the geographic segments or celerant is not performing well in the future 
in addition  changes in the assumptions used in the analysis could have changed the resulting outcome 
for example  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units at august   we made estimates and judgments about future cash flows based on our fiscal forecast and current long range plans used to manage the business 
these long range estimates could change in the future depending on internal changes in our company as well as external factors 
future changes in estimates could possibly result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
developed technology and customer relationships are amortized over three years as a cost of revenue 
our trade names have an indefinite life and therefore are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we review our intangible assets periodically for indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge against certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the silverstream acquisition 
deferred tax assets 
we perform quarterly and annual assessments of the realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
as a result of these assessments  we previously established valuation allowances on select deferred tax assets that were considered to be at risk due to their unique characteristics and limitations  such as capital loss carryovers and acquired tax attributes 
through the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the remaining recognized deferred tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance established in the fourth quarter of fiscal was recorded as a result of our analysis of the facts and circumstances at that time  which led us to conclude that we could no longer forecast future us taxable income under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s cumulative pre tax book loss for three consecutive years ended october  imposed a high standard for compelling  positive evidence of the likelihood of  and ability to forecast  future taxable income in the near term 
as a result  in the fourth fiscal quarter  we provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets carried on our balance sheet 
in addition  during fiscal  we incurred us pre tax losses for tax reporting purposes 
at october   we have been in a cumulative pre tax loss position for each of the last three years 
as a result  we have provided a full valuation reserve on our deferred tax assets 
we recorded deferred tax liabilities during fiscal for foreign jurisdictions 
the deferred tax liabilities recorded in foreign jurisdictions were attributable to book to tax basis differences recorded as part of purchase price accounting for the assets and liabilities of companies acquired during the year 
loss contingency accruals 
we are required to make accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation  restructurings and taxes 
we accrue these items in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies however the estimation of the amount to accrue requires significant judgment 
litigation accruals require we make assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on current information 
when our restructurings include leased facilities  we are required to make assumptions about future sublease income  which would offset our costs and decrease our accrual 
from time to time  we are subjected to tax audits and must make assumptions about the outcome of the audit 
if any of the estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if actual outcomes are different than our estimates  we may be required to record additional charges or reduce our accruals for example  during fiscal  we recorded a million adjustment to a previous restructuring accrual due to changes in estimates we originally made regarding future sublease income  a million reduction of our litigation accrual due to changes in the estimated outcome of certain ongoing legal cases and a million reduction to our litigation accrual and million reduction to our income tax accrual due to one time adjustments to these reserves

on july   we purchased all of the outstanding stock of salmon ltd  a privately held information technology services and consulting firm headquartered in watford  england  for approximately million in cash  plus estimated merger and transaction costs of million 
in addition  we recorded a deferred income tax liability of million resulting from the future tax consequences of the non deductibility of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with this acquisition 
the purchase agreement provides for contingent payments of up to an additional million based upon the future revenues and profitability of both salmon and novell in the united kingdom over a period of two years 
any future earnout payments will be capitalized as goodwill when and if paid 
revenues of million and expenses of million were included in our statement of operations related to salmon for the period from acquisition july  to october  suse linux ag on january   we purchased substantially all of the outstanding stock of suse linux ag  a privately held company and a leading provider of linux based products  for approximately million in cash  plus estimated merger and transaction costs of million

silverstream s results of operations have been incorporated into our statement of operations beginning on the acquisition date of july  revenue we sell our products  services  and solutions primarily to corporations  government entities  educational institutions  resellers and distributors both domestically and internationally

maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased worldwide services revenue  which increased million or  the recognition of million of royalty revenue related to the legal judgment against the canopy group  inc canopy  the addition of million in suse services revenue  and the benefit of favorable foreign exchange rates  primarily in europe 
these increases were offset somewhat by lower netware maintenance revenue  which decreased by million or

revenues by solution category in north america were as follows vs vs in millions percentage change identity management and web services solutions cross platform solutions services total net revenue the overall increase in the north america segment revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to increased revenue in our cross platform services solution category 
this increase is due primarily to the recognition of million of royalty revenue related to the legal judgment against canopy 
excluding the canopy revenue  north america revenue for fiscal decreased by million or compared to the fiscal these declines are primarily due to a million or decline in fiscal in netware revenues and a million or decrease in worldwide services revenue 
these declines are offset somewhat by increases in zenworks revenues of million or for fiscal compared to fiscal  principally related to our successful release of zenworks during the third quarter of fiscal and the addition of million in revenue from suse in fiscal the suse revenue included subscriptions related to approximately  units of sles revenues in identity management and web solutions and services remained relatively flat 
revenue in the north america segment decreased in fiscal compared to by 
the decrease is mainly a result of a million or decrease in netware revenue as a result of declining license maintenance sales  and a million reduction in it consulting revenues  which was due to the difficult economy  which caused corporate it spending in general to decrease 
these decreases were offset somewhat by increased identity management and web services revenue  primarily in the extend product line 
revenues by solution category in the emea segment were as follows vs vs in millions percentage change identity management and web services solutions cross platform solutions services total net revenue the overall increase in the emea segment revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to favorable foreign currency exchange rates  which increased revenues by approximately million for fiscal this increase is also due to the inclusion of suse revenues in the cross platform services solution category of million for fiscal compared to no suse revenue in fiscal also  revenues for fiscal increased by approximately million due to the inclusion of salmon revenues 
during fiscal  suse revenue in emea included subscriptions related to approximately  units of sles and  units of sles during fiscal excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  suse revenues and salmon revenues  revenues for emea for fiscal decreased by approximately million or due primarily to declining netware revenue and lower than expected maintenance renewals in germany and the united kingdom

table of contents revenues in the celerant consulting segment were as follows vs vs in millions percentage change celerant consulting celerant revenues for fiscal increased compared to the prior year due to a combination of underlying growth in the business and favorable currency exchange rates 
excluding the impact of the foreign currency exchange rates  revenue increased by for fiscal compared to fiscal due to improved revenue growth in our european businesses 
revenue in the celerant consulting segment increased by in compared to due to favorable exchange rates and increased demand for services 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents revenue that has been billed or collected  but that will be recognized when the earnings process is completed in future periods 
the majority of deferred revenue relates to maintenance contracts and subscriptions and is recognized ratably over the related periods  typically one year 
at october   deferred revenue increased by million or to million compared to the balance at october  this increase is largely attributable to a million increase due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates  a million increase due to the inclusion of suse deferred revenue  and the remaining increase is primarily due to advanced invoicing of maintenance contract renewals and to changes in our business mix moving towards more maintenance and subscription contracts 
forward looking revenue trends we expect netware to continue to decline in fiscal and we will attempt to offset this decline with growth in our new products 
based on our review of industry trend reports from industry analysts  we expect the linux and identity management markets to grow between and  respectively  in fiscal we anticipate our revenues in these areas will increase as well 
in addition based on our review of idc reports  we anticipate an overall improvement in it spending of around  which should help us increase our zenworks  consulting and support revenue in fiscal gross profit vs vs in millions percentage change new software licenses as a percent of new software license revenue maintenance and services as a percent of maintenance and services revenue total gross profit as a percent of net revenue the increase in gross profit from new software licenses as a percentage of related revenue from fiscal to fiscal and the decrease in gross profit from software licenses as a percentage of related revenue from fiscal to fiscal are due to an intangible asset impairment charge taken in fiscal against software licenses of million 
this charge related to intangible assets from the acquisition of silverstream 
the increase in gross profit from maintenance and services as a percentage of related revenue from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the recognition of million of revenue in connection with the novell annual report n 
table of contents canopy legal judgment during fiscal  which had relatively little corresponding cost of sales 
in addition  our margins were positively impacted by increased consulting billing rates  which increased from per hour in fiscal to per hour in fiscal and from cost savings related to workforce reductions we implemented during fiscal and  mainly in the north america and emea segments 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue on maintenance and services increased in fiscal relative to fiscal due to efforts to improve resource utilization in our it consulting services such as elimination of excess capacity  which was partially offset by the intangible asset impairment charge of million taken against maintenance and services in fiscal forward looking gross margin trends we expect gross margin percentages will decrease in fiscal as our revenue mix continues to shift from software licenses to services as our linux and worldwide services businesses improve 
additionally  during fiscal we anticipate that gross margin percentages will be lower as we increase our investment in restructuring the north america and emea businesses and in increasing compensation to retain and motivate our employees  who have had limited compensation increases over the last two years

sales and marketing expense  in total and as a percentage of revenue  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher advertising costs and the addition of silverstream sales and marketing costs  including silverstream employees  for the full twelve months of fiscal product development costs in fiscal increased compared to fiscal due to increased research and development activity from the acquisitions of ximian and suse 
product development headcount increased by engineers compared to the prior year due primarily to the acquisitions of ximian and suse  offset by workforce reductions in other areas of product development

table of contents silverstream product development costs  including silverstream employees who became novell product development employees in july general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to favorable legal developments that allowed us to reduce our legal reserves by million during our second quarter of fiscal  one time adjustments to our medical liabilities  accounts payable accruals  and legal reserves of million during our fourth quarter of fiscal  and a one time adjustment to decrease bad debt expense by million compared to fiscal  offset somewhat by increased expenses related to the addition of suse and salmon general and administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased  in total and as a percentage of revenue  in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a full year s impact of restructuring activities undertaken in this decrease was partially offset by the addition of silverstream general and administrative costs in july purchased in process research and development is technology purchased in the acquisitions of ximian and silverstream that was not technologically feasible at the date of the acquisition  meaning it had not reached the working model stage  did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product  and was not ready for initial customer testing 
in process research and development was valued based on discounting forecasted cash flows that will be generated directly from the related products 
the in process research and development does not have any alternative future use and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
as a result  the entire amount was expensed 
forward looking operating expense trends in order to fully transition our business from our legacy products  such as netware  to those that will drive our future growth  such as linux  we will need to maintain a transitional cost structure in order to develop  market and sell these products and solutions 
specifically  we anticipate our investment in product development in fiscal will be higher than recent years as we develop new products and re architect older products 
we expect to continue to incur costs in north america as we complete the process of restructuring this organization and expect to incur costs to similarly restructure our emea business 
we plan to increase compensation to retain and motivate our employees in fiscal  who have had limited compensation increases over the last two years 
this will increase both cost of sales and operating expenses 
gain impairment on real property during fiscal  we recognized a gain of million on the sale of one of our facilities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that there were indicators of impairment related to our facility in san jose  california and a small building in provo  utah due to the move of most employees from san jose to other facilities  as well as changes in the local real estate market 
we then performed an analysis of each of the property s future undiscounted cash flows and determined that their estimated future cost recovery was lower than the recorded net book value of the assets 
based on the results of this analysis  we obtained an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of these locations 
based on the fair value of these facilities as determined by the independent appraisals  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our facility in san jose  california  for million  which resulted in a realized gain of million 
restructuring expenses second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded net restructuring expenses of million  million  and million  respectively 
these restructuring expenses were in response to the evolution of our business strategy to develop a competitive position in the linux market 
this strategy includes plans to support the linux operating system in addition to the netware operating system  by offering our novell annual report n 
table of contents products and services that run on linux  netware and other platforms 
the acquisitions of ximian and suse are direct results of the evolution in our business strategy 
these changes were made to address market penetration for linux and netware and to address netware revenue declines 
specific actions taken include reducing our workforce by employees during the second quarter  employees during the third quarter  and employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mainly in consulting  sales and product development in emea and north america 
in addition  we consolidated facilities  resulting in the closure of two sales facilities and the disposal of excess equipment and tenant improvements in the united states 
total restructuring expenses for fiscal by reporting segment were as follows north america million  emea million  asia pacific million  latin america million  and non allocated corporate costs million 
the following table summarizes the activity during fiscal related to this restructuring balance at original cash non cash october  reserve payments adjustments in millions severance and benefits excess facilities and property and equipment as of october   the remaining balance of the fiscal restructuring expenses included accrued liabilities related to severance and benefits  which will be paid out over the remaining severance obligation period  not to exceed two years  lease costs for redundant facilities  which will be paid over the respective remaining contract terms  and various severed employee related costs  which will be paid over the respective remaining contract terms 
during fiscal  we also recorded a million restructuring expense to increase prior restructuring liabilities by million and prior merger related liabilities by million  and we released approximately million of excess restructuring reserves related to prior restructuring events 
the increases were the result of changes in estimates used when the original expenses were recorded primarily due to changes in the real estate market in the united kingdom 
the net impact of the fiscal restructurings and the release of the prior restructuring excess reserves was an expense of million in fiscal third quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax restructuring expense of approximately million resulting from the restructuring of our operations in response to changes in general market conditions  changing customer demands  and the evolution of our business strategy relative to the identity management and web services areas of our business and our revised strategy 
this strategy includes plans to support linux in addition to netware by offering our products and services that run on both netware and linux platforms 
these changes in strategy and company structure were made to address the then current revenue declines 
specific actions taken included reducing our workforce worldwide by approximately employees approximately across all functions and geographies  with a majority coming from product development  sales  and general and administrative functions  primarily in the united states 
in addition  we consolidated facilities and disposed of excess equipment 
total restructuring expenses by reporting segment were as follows north america million  emea million  asia pacific million  and latin america million of the total restructuring expense 
as of october   the remaining balance of the third quarter of fiscal restructuring expense included accrued liabilities related to redundant facilities and other fixed contracts  which will be paid over the respective remaining contract terms  and various severed employee related costs  which will be paid over the respective remaining contract terms

the additional accrual relates mainly to the severance of approximately employees and the closing of excess facilities 
such activities occurred mostly in the north america reporting segment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we also released approximately million related to excess restructuring reserves related to the second quarter fiscal restructuring event 
the net impact of the third quarter fiscal restructuring and the release of the excess fiscal restructuring reserves was an expense of million 
second quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that the amount we had originally accrued for facility related costs in previous restructurings was too low and accrued an additional million 
the original liability was based on estimated sublease rates and timing  which have been affected by the decline in the real estate market 
second quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax restructuring expense of approximately million 
the expense was a result of our continued move toward becoming a business solutions provider  addressing changes in the market due to technology changes  and becoming more customer focused

the decline in investment impairments during fiscal and fiscal from the prior years is primarily the result of more stable fund valuations as compared to the same periods in fiscal and fiscal investment income for fiscal increased compared to fiscal due to the collection of million of interest income earned in connection with the favorable legal judgment against canopy during the third quarter of fiscal investment income decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to lower yields on short term investments 
other expenses  net  for fiscal increased compared to fiscal primarily due to higher foreign currency transaction losses and a slight increase in interest expense of million related to the issuance of senior convertible debentures on july  other expenses  net  for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to higher foreign currency transaction losses 
income tax expense vs vs in millions percentage change income tax expense as a percent of revenue effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal significantly decreased from fiscal primarily as a result of a full valuation allowance that was established for our total deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of for fiscal  we did not record income tax expense for us activity 
on a us tax return basis  we expect a taxable loss for thus  we concluded that we could not forecast future us taxable income under the more likely than not standard 
accordingly  current year deferred tax provisions were also recorded as adjustments to the valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate for fiscal significantly changed from the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily as a result of the need for additional valuation allowances in fiscal in the fourth quarter of  we provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets carried on our balance sheet 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of a company s current and previous performance and other relevant novell annual report n 
table of contents factors when determining the need for such a valuation allowance 
under this pronouncement  factors such as current and previous operating losses are given greater weight than the outlook for future profitability in determining deferred tax asset carrying value 
this adjustment will have no impact on our cash flow or future prospects  nor does it alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future 
as deferred tax assets or liabilities increase or decrease in the future  or if a portion or all of the valuation allowance is no longer deemed to be necessary  the adjustment to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease future income tax provisions 
in connection with our review of our tax reserves for the fourth quarter of  we determined that the amount of reserves required for tax exposures was less than the amount recorded in the financial statements 
as a result  we reduced the tax reserve and provision by million 
on november   we announced an agreement with microsoft to settle potential antitrust litigation 
a gain of million  the settlement less estimated transaction costs  will be included in operating income in our first fiscal quarter ended january  we anticipate using net operating loss carryforwards against this income  and expect an estimated million current liability as a result of the related alternative minimum tax 
preferred stock dividends in millions non cash deemed dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock preferred stock cash dividends on march   we entered into a definitive agreement with ibm providing for an investment of million by ibm in novell 
the primary terms of the investment  which were negotiated in november  entailed the purchase by ibm of  shares of our series b redeemable preferred stock that are convertible into million shares of our common stock at a price of per common share 
the shares are entitled to a dividend of per annum  payable quarterly in cash 
dividends on preferred stock were million during fiscal because the fair value of our common stock of per share on march  was greater than the conversion price of per share  we recorded a one time  non cash deemed dividend of million attributable to the value of the series b preferred stock s conversion feature 
this beneficial conversion feature had no impact on net income  but did reduce earnings attributable to common stockholders and thus reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately in fiscal on june   shares of series b preferred stock  with a carrying value of million  were converted into million shares of our common stock 
change in accounting principle effective november   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires the discontinuance of amortization related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
these assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
includes provisions requiring the identification of reporting units upon adoption for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments and the performance of an initial impairment analysis within the first six months after adoption 
we completed our goodwill impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million related to our consulting segment as of november   which was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operations

our liquidity needs for the next twelve months are principally for financing of fixed assets  commitments to our venture capital funds and product development and to maintain flexibility in a dynamic and competitive operating environment  including the ability to pursue potential acquisition and investment opportunities 
our liquidity needs beyond the next twelve months include those mentioned previously in addition to redemption of our debentures 
we anticipate generating positive cash flows from operations in addition to investment income in fiscal sufficient to fund operations 
we anticipate being able to fund our current operations  future potential acquisitions  any further integration  restructuring or additional merger related costs  and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months with existing cash and short term investments together with cash generated from operations and investment income 
we believe that borrowings under our credit facilities or offerings of equity or debt securities are possible for expenditures beyond the next twelve months  if the need arises  although such offerings may not be available to us on acceptable terms and are dependent on market conditions at such time 
investments will continue in product development and in new and existing areas of technology 
cash may also be used to acquire technology through purchases and strategic acquisitions 
we also anticipate having adequate cash in fiscal for necessary capital expenditures 
recent pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue  participating securities and the two class method under financial accounting standards board novell annual report n 
table of contents fasb statement  issue requires the two class method of calculating earnings per share for companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends of the company 
because the series b preferred stock participates in dividends  we are required to use the two class method of calculating earnings per share  effective in fiscal and retroactively for all prior periods 
this change in computational methods had no impact on earnings per share for any period in fiscal or any prior period 
in november  the eitf reached a final conclusion on issue  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
eitf issue addresses when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt with a market price trigger should be included in diluted earnings per share calculations 
the eitf s conclusion is that the market price trigger should be ignored and that these securities should be treated as convertible securities and included in diluted earnings per share regardless of whether the conversion contingencies have been met 
because our senior convertible debentures are contingently convertible debt with a market price trigger  we will be required to comply with eitf issue beginning in the first quarter of fiscal had the conclusions of eitf issue been effective for fiscal  reported earnings per share would not have changed due to the timing of our issuance of the senior convertible debentures 
however  future earnings per share could be impacted by the adoption of this standard 
for example  had the senior convertible debentures been outstanding for the fiscal year ended october   on a pro forma basis our diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock would have been instead of our reported per diluted share and our weighted average number of shares would have increased by approximately million shares 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for employee stock options  sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas nos 
and supercedes accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees

r is effective beginning for interim or annual periods beginning after june   which would be our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal we are in the process of determining the impact sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors our netware revenue stream continues to deteriorate 
we have been selling and upgrading netware for many years  sales of which have been declining 
overall  netware license and maintenance revenue of our business declined by million in fiscal  excluding the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates 
our next generations of netware enterprise ready operating system and services  open enterprise server  will give customers the opportunity to choose between a netware operating system and a linux operating system  providing netware customers a means to migrate to linux and open source solutions while maintaining enterprise class functionality to which they have become accustomed 
our goal is that by providing a migration strategy  we will retain existing netware customers and gain new customers who are looking for the additional benefits that open source has to offer 
if this strategy is unsuccessful  our netware revenue stream will deteriorate faster than the growth of revenue streams from our other products 
we had net losses in fiscal years and and may not maintain profitability 
we had net losses of million in and million in although we generated net income of million in  we cannot be certain that we will generate sufficient revenues to maintain profitability 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses increase more novell annual report n 
table of contents than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
if our identity management and cross platform services solutions do not grow at the rate we anticipate  our growth will be negatively impacted 
our product strategy focuses on two specific areas identity management and web services solutions  and cross platform services solutions with a specific emphasis on open source platforms 
we have focused on these offerings because we believe that identity driven solutions and open source platforms are two of the fastest growing segments in our industry  and we believe that they represent the best opportunity for us to profitably grow our revenues 
our ability to achieve success with this strategy is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following the growth of these markets  development of key product solutions and upgrades  the acceptance of these solutions by clients  particularly enterprise companies  enticing customers to upgrade from older versions of our products to newer versions  successfully selling technical support and other novell solutions to our maintenance customers of our open source products  and the acceptance of those products by large industry partners and major accounts 
we may not be able to successfully compete in a challenging market for computer software and consulting services 
the industries we compete in are highly competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants 
competitors of our identity management and web services solutions and cross platform solutions include microsoft  ibm  sun  hp  altiris  and computer associates 
our primary competitor in the north america linux market is red hat 
competitors of our worldwide services group include ibm  accenture  hp  csc and capgemini 
competitors of our celerant consulting segment include at kearney  mckinsey co  ibm global services  capgemini  and the management consulting group 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
we believe that competitive factors common to all of our segments include the pricing of our products and services and the pricing strategies of our competitors  the timing and market acceptance of new solutions developed by us and our competitors  brand and product awareness  the performance  reliability and security of our products  the ability to preserve our legacy customer base  our ability to establish and maintain key strategic relationships with distributors  resellers and other partners  and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified development  consulting and managerial personnel 
if third parties claim that we infringed upon their intellectual property  our ability to use some technologies and products could be limited and we may incur significant costs to resolve these claims 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the software industry 
we have from time to time received letters or been the subject of claims suggesting that we are infringing upon the intellectual novell annual report n 
table of contents rights of others 
in addition  we have faced and expect to continue to face from time to time disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
the cost and time of defending ourselves can be significant 
if an infringement claim is successful  we and our customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties  and we may be obligated to pay or reimburse our customers for monetary damages 
in such instances  we or our customers may not be able to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or at all  and may face delays in product shipment while developing or arranging for alternative technologies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in the event claims for indemnification are brought for intellectual property infringement  we could incur significant expenses  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
we indemnify customers against certain claims that our products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
additionally  under our novell linux indemnification program  we offer indemnification for copyright infringement claims made by third parties against registered novell customers who obtain suse linux enterprise server  suse linux enterprise server  suse linux retail solution  and novell linux desktop  and who  after january   obtain upgrade protection and a qualifying technical support contract from us or a participating channel partner 
although indemnification programs for proprietary software are common in our industry  indemnification programs that cover open source software are not 
for example  sco has brought claims against two end users of linux and has threatened to bring claims against other end users of linux arising out of the facts alleged in sco s lawsuit against ibm and in sco s public statements 
in the event that claims for indemnification are brought for intellectual property infringement  we could incur significant expense reimbursing customers for their legal costs and  in the event those claims are successful  for damages 
legal actions being taken by sco could adversely affect our revenues and business plan if these legal actions cause a reduction in demand for our suse linux and ximian products 
sco filed a legal action in march against ibm alleging  among other things  that linux is an unauthorized derivative of unix and that portions of unix intellectual property that sco alleges it owns have been included in the linux operating system without authorization 
in addition  sco has warned that legal liability for the use of linux may extend to commercial users  has threatened users with litigation and sought licensing fees from them  and more recently has filed linux related suits against other parties 
as discussed below  sco has sued novell for slander of title relating to disputes about whether novell or sco owns the copyrights to unix  on which some of sco s linux related claims depend 
it is possible that sco s actions may reduce general demand for linux and linux related products and services 
in this event  demand for our linux or open source products and services could decrease  thereby reducing revenue  and would otherwise adversely affect our business since we have made a strategic decision to become active in the linux market 
a lawsuit filed against us by sco could result in a substantial judgment against us and adversely affect our revenues and business plan if they are successful 
in january  sco filed suit against us in the third judicial district court of salt lake county  state of utah 
we removed the claim to the us district court  district of utah 
sco s original complaint alleged that our public statements and filings regarding the ownership of the copyrights in unix and unixware have harmed sco s business reputation and affected its efforts to protect its ownership interest in unix and unixware 
the district court dismissed the original complaint  but allowed sco an opportunity to file an amended complaint  which sco did in july as with the original complaint  sco is again seeking to require us to assign all copyrights that we have registered in unix and unixware to sco  to prevent us from representing that we have any ownership interest in the unix and unixware copyrights and to require us to withdraw all representations we have made regarding our ownership of the unix and unixware copyrights novell annual report n 
table of contents and to pay actual  special and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial 
we have again sought to dismiss sco s amended complaint 
our revenues and business plan could be adversely affected if sco is ultimately successful 
we have experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to various factors  resulting in lost revenue 
we have in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to a number of factors  including the complexity of software products  the need for extensive testing of software to ensure compatibility of new releases with a wide variety of application software and hardware devices  the need to debug products prior to extensive distribution  and with regard to our open source products  our increasing reliance on the work of third parties not employed by novell 
additionally  our open source offerings depend to a large extent on the efforts of developers not employed by us for the creation and update of open source technologies 
for example  linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of engineers  many of whom are not employed by us  are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel that is a key component of our open enterprise server offering 
the timing and nature of new releases of the linux kernel are controlled by these third parties 
delays in developing  completing  or shipping new or enhanced products could result in delayed or reduced revenues for those products and could adversely impact customer acceptance of those offerings 
we benefit from the open source contributions of third party programmers and corporations  and if they cease to make these contributions  our product strategy could be adversely affected 
our open source offerings depend to a large extent on the efforts of developers not employed by us for the creation and update of open source technologies 
also  we and many other corporations contribute software into the open source movement 
if key members  or a significant percentage  of this group of developers or corporations decides to cease development of the linux kernel or other open source applications  we would have to either rely on another party or parties to develop these technologies  develop them ourselves or adapt our product strategy accordingly 
this could increase our development expenses  delay our product releases and upgrades or adversely impact customer acceptance of open source offerings 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel because of the intense competition for qualified personnel in the computer and consulting industries 
our ability to maintain our competitive technological position depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified development  consulting  and managerial personnel 
competition for personnel of the highest caliber is intense in the software and consulting industries 
the loss of certain key individuals  or a significant group of key personnel  would adversely affect our performance 
the failure to successfully hire suitable replacements in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our relationships with other it services organizations become impaired we could lose business 
we maintain relationships with it services organizations that recommend  design and implement solutions for their customers businesses that include our products 
any of these organizations could decide at any time to not continue to do business with us or to not recommend our products 
a change in the willingness of these it service organizations to do business with us or recommend our products could result in lower revenues 
novell annual report n 
table of contents the success of our acquisitions is dependent on our ability to integrate personnel  operations and technology  and if we are not successful  our revenue will not grow at the rate we anticipate 
achieving the benefits of acquisitions will depend in part on the successful integration of personnel  operations and technology 
the integration of acquisitions will be subject to risks and will require significant expenditure of time and resources 
the challenges involved in integrating acquisitions include the following obtaining synergies from the companies organizations  obtaining synergies from the companies service and product offerings effectively and quickly  bringing together marketing efforts so that the market receives useful information about the combined companies and their products  coordinating sales efforts so that customers can do business easily with the combined companies  integrating product offerings  technology  back office  human resources  accounting and financial systems  assimilating employees who come from diverse corporate cultural backgrounds into a common business culture revolving around our solutions offerings  and retaining key officers and employees who possess the necessary skills and experience to quickly and effectively transition and integrate the businesses 
failure to effectively and timely complete the integration of acquisitions could materially harm the business and operating results of the combined companies 
in addition  goodwill related to any acquisitions could become impaired 
furthermore  we may assume significant liabilities in connection with acquisitions we make or become responsible for liabilities of the acquired businesses 
our financial and operating results may vary and may fall below analysts estimates  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we do not currently provide estimates of our revenues or results of operations for future periods 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers  impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the price of our products in international locations  inability to respond to the decline in revenue through the distribution channel  inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers and systems integration partners 
in addition  we often experience a higher volume of revenue at the end of each quarter and during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
because of this  fixed costs that are out of line with revenue levels may not be detected until late in any given quarter and results of operations could be adversely affected 
due to these factors or other unanticipated events  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance 
in addition  from time to time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company  or of investors generally 
this could cause the market price of our securities to decline  perhaps significantly 
novell annual report n 
table of contents we face increased risks in conducting a global business 
we are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries around the world and  as such  we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically 
certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results  including costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  longer payment cycles  local political and economic conditions  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which can affect demand and increase our costs 
we may not be able to protect our confidential information  and this could adversely affect our business 
we generally enter into contractual relationships with our employees that protect our confidential information 
the misappropriation of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we may not be able to timely detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
in the event we are unable to enforce these contractual obligations and our intellectual property rights  our business could be adversely affected 
some of our short term  long term  and venture capital fund investments have become impaired and additional investments could become impaired 
our investment portfolio includes investments in public equity securities  small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  private companies  and funds managed by venture capitalists 
many of these investments might become other than temporarily impaired 
during our fiscal years ended october  and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to some of the investments in our portfolio whose market value had experienced an other than temporary decline 
as of october   we had net unrealized gains  net of taxes  on investments totaling approximately million 
if the funds in which we have invested suffer poor financial performance  or if the private companies in which we have invested are not successfully acquired or undertake initial public offerings  the value of our investments may decrease further 
our consulting services contracts contain pricing risks and  if our estimates prove inaccurate  we could lose money 
our it and celerant consulting businesses derive a portion of their revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts 
because of the complex nature of the services provided  it is sometimes difficult to accurately estimate the cost  scope and duration of particular client engagements 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required for a project  do not accurately assess the scope of work associated with a project  do not manage the project properly  or do not satisfy our obligations in a manner consistent with the contract  then our costs to complete the project could increase substantially 
we have occasionally had to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  and may have to take similar action in the future 
we may not be compensated for these additional costs or the commitment of these additional resources 
novell annual report n 
table of contents additionally  our celerant consulting business derives revenue from projects priced on a contingency basis 
if results are not met  or if a dispute arises  we may not be able to realize a potentially large amount of revenue 
our it and celerant consulting clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with us on short notice 
if our clients cancel or reduce the scope of an engagement with our it or celerant consulting business  we may be unable to reassign our professionals to new engagements without delay 
personnel and related costs constitute a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
because these expenses are relatively fixed  and because we establish the levels of these expenses well in advance of any particular quarter  cancellations or reductions in the scope of client engagements could result in the under utilization of our professional services employees  causing significant reductions in operating results for a particular quarter 
recent changes in the accounting treatment of the debentures may cause us to report significant dilution of our earnings per share 
in november  the eitf reached a final conclusion on issue that changed the accounting treatment for contingent convertible debt  including the debentures 
as a result  the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures must be included in any calculation of earnings per share on a fully diluted basis 
this change has retroactive effect and will cause us to report  in our form q for our first quarter of fiscal  significant dilution of our earnings per share reflecting the shares of our common stock underlying the outstanding debentures 
our stock price may suffer due to the report of lower earnings per share 
conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
the conversion of some or all of the debentures into shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interest of existing common stockholders 
any large volume sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could depress the price of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices of equity securities 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts and currency options 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of our short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our strategy is to invest in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
market risk we also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
as of october   gross unrealized gains  before tax effect on the short term public equity securities totaled million 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of our short term investments 
in addition  we invest in equity securities issued by privately held companies that are included in our long term portfolio of investments  primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in thinly capitalized companies in the high technology industry sector or venture capital funds 
because of the nature of these investments  we are exposed to equity price risks 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices of long term equity securities would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our long term securities 
foreign currency risk we use derivatives to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when re measured or settled according to accounting principles generally accepted in the us  impact our consolidated statement of operations 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs 
all forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
gains and losses on these currency forward contracts would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge  resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income expense in the same period as when the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if we did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an increase or decrease of in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this number represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
