item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
among the five economic areas  rockford has the highest concentration of manufacturing activities 
community banking  on the other hand  has less growth potential and a greater concentration of smaller sized business and agricultural concentrations 
at the end of  economic conditions for madison were characterized as strong with low unemployment 
for chicagoland  economic conditions were stable with strong development activity and loan growth 
for rockford  economic conditions were characterized as improving with declining unemployment rates 
economic conditions for the community banking areas were stable with declining unemployment rates 
the bank has locations throughout northern illinois  excluding the far northwestern counties  including the illinois cities of rockford  algonquin  elgin  carpentersville  carol stream  crystal lake  des plaines  gurnee  lake zurich  lincolnshire  mchenry  morton grove  naperville  schaumburg  oak brook  aurora  st

table of contents woodstock  dixon  freeport  mendota  peru  princeton  sterling and the surrounding communities 
the bank conducts business at locations throughout south central wisconsin  including the wisconsin cities of madison  monroe  baraboo  portage  mt 
horeb  waukesha and the surrounding communities 
through its banking locations  amcore provides various personal banking  commercial banking and related financial services 
amcore also conducts banking business through four supermarket branches  which gives the customer convenient access to bank services seven days a week 
investment portfolio and policies as a complement to its commercial and retail banking segments  the bank also carries a securities investment portfolio 
the level of assets that the company holds in securities is dependent upon a variety of factors 
chief among these factors is the optimal utilization of the company s capital 
after consideration of loan demand  excess capital is available to allocate to high quality investment activities that can generate additional income for the company  while still maintaining strong capital ratios 
in addition to producing additional interest spreads for the bank  the investment portfolio is used as a source of liquidity  to manage interest rate risk and to meet pledging requirements of the bank 
the investment portfolio is governed by an investment policy designed to provide maximum flexibility in terms of liquidity and to contain risk from changes in interest rates 
individual holdings are diversified  maximum terms and durations are limited and minimum credit ratings are enforced and monitored 
the bank does not engage in trading activities 
the amount of securities that the company is permitted to invest in that have a higher degree of risk of loss are defined and limited by company policy 
the investment portfolio is managed on a day to day basis by a professional investment manager from amcore s trust and asset management segment 
portfolio performance and changing risk profiles are regularly monitored by the asset and liability committee and the investment committee of amcore s board of directors 
sources of funding liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
these commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for secured deposits and borrowings  paying dividends to its parent company  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
liquidity is derived primarily from bank issued deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided by operations  and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include brokered certificates of deposit cd s  federal funds purchased lines fed funds  federal reserve discount window advances  federal home loan bank fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  commercial paper and back up lines of credit  the sale or securitization of loans  and access to other capital markets 
bank issued deposits from the bank s retail and commercial customers are considered by management to be the primary  most stable and most cost effective source of funding and liquidity 
retail banking segment retail banking services to individuals include deposit demand  savings and time deposit accounts and lending activities 
principal lending types include installment loans primarily direct and indirect automobile lending  mortgage and home equity loans  overdraft protection  personal credit lines and bankcard programs 
mortgage and home equity lending have the lowest risk profile due to the nature of the collateral 
installment loans have an intermediate risk due to the lower principal amounts and the depreciating nature of the collateral 
personal lines and overdraft have the highest degree of risk since the loans are unsecured 
the bankcard programs are a fee service for originating the relationship and no credit risk is retained by the bank 
the bank manages its retail lending risk via a centralized credit process  risk scoring  loan to value and other 
table of contents underwriting standards and knowledge of its customers and their credit history 
as a general rule  the bank does not actively engage in retail lending activities outside its geographic market areas 
the vintage mutual funds  a proprietary family of mutual funds  are also marketed through most banking locations 
the private banking group also markets vintage mutual funds and meets other special needs of high net worth individuals 
commercial banking segment a wide range of financial services are provided to commercial  small business and governmental organizations 
these services include  among others  lending  deposits  letters of credit and cash management services 
the bank has a limited portfolio of equipment leases and does not actively promote this type of financing with its commercial customers 
the commercial banking segment lending products are tailored to the specific customer needs facilities acquisition and expansion  equipment purchases and working capital needs 
commercial lending has a higher risk profile than does retail lending due to the larger dollar amounts involved  the nature of the collateral and a greater variety of economic risks that could potentially affect the loan customer 
the bank manages its commercial lending risks through a centralized underwriting process  serial sign off requirements as dollar amounts increase  lending limits  monitoring concentrations  regular loan review and grading of credits and an active work out management process for troubled credits 
the bank is a lender in the small business administration sba program  with a total loan portfolio of million as of december   and has earned preferred lender status from the sba in both illinois and wisconsin 
this year the company also achieved express lender status  a national designation which significantly shortens the turnaround from application to loan acceptance 
sba loans are popular with small business customers offering them another source of financing 
mortgage banking segment while amcore mortgage  inc merged into amcore bank  na effective january   it continues as a reportable segment 
the mortgage banking segment is a full service operation providing a broad spectrum of mortgage products to meet its customer needs 
residential mortgage loans are originated  of which non conforming adjustable rate  fixed rate  jumbo and balloon mortgages are normally placed in the bank s real estate portfolio 
the conforming adjustable rate  fixed rate and balloon residential mortgage loans are normally sold in the secondary market 
the mortgage banking segment services most of the loans that are sold

automated teller machines located throughout amcore s market area make banking transactions available to customers when the bank facilities or hours are not convenient 
through vintage mutual funds webaccess or via telephone  shareholders can access all of their accounts and purchase  redeem or exchange shares

since  when illinois multi bank holding company legislation became effective  there have been many bank mergers and acquisitions in illinois 
these combinations have had the effect of increasing the assets and deposits of bank holding companies involved in such activities 
illinois legislation  effective december   permitted bank acquisitions in illinois by institutions headquartered in any other state which has reciprocal legislation  further increasing competition 
see supervision and regulation below in this item on september   congress passed laws allowing interstate banking and interstate branching 
a year later  nationwide interstate banking became effective allowing institutions to make acquisitions in any state 
beginning july   interstate branching became effective  and banks can merge with affiliate banks or establish de novo branches in any state 
individual states  however  have the right to opt out of interstate branching 
illinois and wisconsin have not opted out  however  iowa has retained the de novo rules for branching 
employment amcore had  full time equivalent employees as of february  amcore provides a variety of benefit plans to its employees including health  dental  group term life and disability insurance  childcare reimbursement  flexible spending accounts  retirement  profit sharing  k  stock option  stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans 
supervision and regulation amcore is subject to regulations under the bank holding company act of  as amended the act  and is registered with the federal reserve board frb under the act 
amcore is required by the act to file quarterly 
table of contents and annual reports of its operations and such additional information as the frb may require and is subject  along with its subsidiaries  to examination by the frb 
the acquisition of five percent or more of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of any bank by a bank holding company requires the prior approval of the frb and is subject to certain other federal and state law limitations 
the act also prohibits  with certain exceptions  a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than banking  managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries  except that holding companies may engage in  and may own shares of companies engaged in  certain businesses found by the frb to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
on august   the frb approved an amendment to add certain activities and to reduce the burden on bank holding companies that desire to conduct these activities by simplifying the regulatory review process 
under current regulations of the frb  a bank holding company and its non bank subsidiaries are permitted  among other activities  to engage in such banking related businesses as sales and consumer finance  equipment leasing  computer service bureau and software operations  mortgage banking  brokerage and financial advisory services 
the act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
in addition  federal legislation prohibits acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators 
control is defined in certain cases as acquisition of ten percent or more of the outstanding shares of a bank or bank holding company 
there are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance fund in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default 
for example  under a policy of the federal reserve with respect to bank holding company operations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy 
in addition  the cross guarantee provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the fdic for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default 
the federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions 
the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  as such terms are defined under regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies 
in late  congress passed the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of that included many provisions that have had significant effects on the cost structure and operational and managerial standards of commercial banks 
in addition to provisions for recapitalization of the bank insurance fund  this act contains provisions that revised bank supervision and regulation  including  among many other things  the monitoring of capital levels  additional management reporting and external audit requirements  and the addition of consumer provisions that include truth in savings disclosures 
the gramm leach bliley act glb act was enacted november  and  among other things  established a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies and securities firms 
to date  the glb act has not materially affected the company s operations 
however  to the extent the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
this could result in a growing number of larger financial institutions that offer 
table of contents a wider variety of financial services than the company currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the markets the company currently serves 
the foregoing references to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries thereof and are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such statutes and regulations 
amcore is supervised and examined by the frb 
the bank and aig are supervised and regularly examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and are subject to examination by the frb

subsidiary dividends and capital legal limitations exist as to the extent to which the bank can lend or pay dividends to amcore and or its affiliates 
the payment of dividends by a national bank without prior regulatory approval is limited to the current year s net income plus the adjusted retained net income for the two preceding years 
the payment of dividends by any bank or bank holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to the capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and regulations issued by the fdic and the occ collectively agencies 
as of december   approximately million was available for payment to amcore in the form of dividends without prior regulatory approval 
the bank is also limited as to the amount it may lend to amcore and its affiliates 
at december   the maximum amount available to amcore and its affiliates in the form of loans approximated million 
there were no loans outstanding from the bank to affiliates at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the frb issues risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
these capital rules require minimum capital levels as a percent of risk weighted assets 
in order to be adequately capitalized under these guidelines  banking organizations must have minimum capital ratios of and for tier capital and total capital  respectively 
the frb also established leverage capital requirements intended primarily to establish minimum capital requirements for those banking organizations that have historically invested a significant portion of their funds in low risk assets 
federally supervised banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of not less than 
refer to the liquidity and capital management section of item for a summary of amcore s capital ratios as of december  and see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
governmental monetary policies and economic conditions the earnings of all subsidiaries are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities 
in particular  the frb influences general economic conditions and interest rates through various monetary policies and tools 
it does so primarily through open market operations in us government securities  varying the discount rate on member and non member bank borrowings  and setting reserve requirements against bank deposits 
frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
the general effect of such policies upon the future business and earnings of each of the subsidiary companies cannot accurately be predicted 
interest rate sensitivity has a major impact on the earnings of banks 
as market rates change  yields earned on assets may not necessarily move to the same degree as rates paid on liabilities 
for this reason  amcore attempts to minimize earnings volatility related to fluctuations in interest rates through the use of a formal asset liability management program and certain derivative activities 
see item a and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item for additional discussion of interest rate sensitivity and related derivative activities

item legal proceedings management believes that no litigation is threatened or pending in which the company faces potential loss or exposure which will materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
since the company s subsidiaries act as depositories of funds  trustee and escrow agents  they occasionally are named as defendants in lawsuits involving claims to the ownership of funds in particular accounts 
this and other litigation is incidental to the company s business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the significant factors affecting amcore financial  inc and subsidiaries amcore or the company consolidated financial condition as of december  compared to december   and the consolidated results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report 
factors influencing forward looking statements this report on form k contains  and our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and written or oral statements made by the company s officers and directors to the press  potential investors  securities analysts and others will contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby with respect to  among other things  the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of amcore 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon beliefs and assumptions of amcore s management and on information currently available to such management 
the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  should  may  will or similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and amcore undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements in light of new information or future events 
contemplated  projected  forecasted or estimated results in such forward looking statements involve certain inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors many of which are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  the following possibilities i heightened competition  including specifically the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the formation of new products by new or existing competitors  ii adverse state  local and federal legislation and regulation  iii failure to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  iv inability to carry out marketing and or expansion plans  v ability to attract and retain key executives or personnel  vi changes in interest rates including the effect of prepayments  vii general economic and business conditions which are less favorable than expected  viii equity and fixed income market fluctuations  ix unanticipated changes in industry trends  x unanticipated changes in credit quality and risk factors  xi success in gaining regulatory approvals when required  xii changes in federal reserve board monetary policies  xiii unexpected outcomes on existing or new litigation in which amcore  its subsidiaries  officers  directors or employees are named defendants  xiv technological changes  xv changes in us generally accepted accounting principles  xvi changes in assumptions or conditions affecting the application of critical accounting estimates  xvii inability of third party vendors to perform critical services for the company or its customers  xviii disruption of operations caused by the conversion and installation of data processing systems  and xix zoning restrictions or other limitations at the local level  which could prevent limited branches from transitioning to full service facilities 
critical accounting estimates the financial condition and results of operations for amcore presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 

table of contents presented below are discussions of those accounting policies that management believes requires its most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain critical accounting estimates and are most important to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operation 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses loans  the company s largest income earning asset category  are periodically evaluated by management in order to establish an estimated allowance for loan losses allowance that are probable as of the respective reporting date and considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience and other loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions  among other things 
additions to the allowance are charged against earnings for the period as a provision for loan losses provision 
conversely  this evaluation could result in a decrease in the allowance and provision 
actual loan losses are charged against and reduce the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal will not occur 
unpaid interest attributable to prior years for loans that are placed on non accrual status is also charged against and reduces the allowance 
unpaid interest for the current year for loans that are placed on non accrual status is charged against and reduces the interest income previously recognized 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance  if any  are credited to and increase the allowance 
the allowance is also subject to periodic examination by regulators whose review includes a determination as to its adequacy to absorb probable losses 
those judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the initial and on going credit worthiness of the borrower  the amount and timing of future cash flows of the borrower that are available for repayment of the loan  the sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  the frequency and subjectivity of loan reviews and risk gradings  emerging or changing trends that might not be fully captured in the historical loss experience  and charges against the allowance for actual losses that are greater or less than previously estimated 
these judgments and assumptions are dependent upon or can be influenced by a variety of factors including the breadth and depth of experience of lending officers  credit administration and the corporate loan review staff that periodically review the status of the loan  changing economic and industry conditions  changes in the financial condition of the borrower and changes in the value and availability of the underlying collateral and guarantees 
while the company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the amount and timing of interest income and loan losses could be materially different 
these factors are most pronounced during economic downturns and may continue into an economic recovery  as specific credit performance may not be immediately affected by the stress of the downturn 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the amount and timing of losses on loans it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected the adequacy of the allowance by ten percent  an additional provision of million would have been necessary

mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as separate assets the right to service mortgage loans for others 
mortgage servicing rights that are retained when mortgage loans are sold to a third party are recorded by allocating the previous 
table of contents carrying amount of the sold loan between the servicing rights retained and the loans that are sold 
this allocation is based upon the relative fair values of the mortgage servicing rights and the loans sold 
because it is retained as an asset  the amount allocated to mortgage servicing rights will have a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized on the sale of the loans 
the mortgage servicing rights asset is amortized based upon the actual amortization of the underlying servicing portfolio 
amortization of the servicing rights asset will reduce the amount of income that is recorded in the respective period from the servicing of the mortgage loans 
each reporting period  the company re evaluates the fair value of its remaining mortgage servicing rights asset 
the amount by which the unamortized carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights exceeds the new estimate of fair value is charged against earnings for the period 
rather than directly reducing the unamortized carrying amount of the servicing rights asset  a valuation allowance is established for the same amount as the charge against earnings 
in subsequent reporting periods  depending upon current estimates of fair value  the valuation allowance may be reversed 
the reversal is limited to the remaining amount of the valuation allowance and will result in an increase in earnings 
the periodic re evaluation of fair value is based upon current estimates of the present value of remaining net servicing cash flows that incorporate numerous assumptions including the cost of servicing the loans  discount rates  prepayment rates and default rates 
this re evaluation is performed by stratifying mortgage servicing rights assets into pools based upon loan type and investor 
valuation allowances are recorded for each defined pool  as applicable 
valuation allowances required for one pool cannot be offset by the amount that the fair value of another pool exceeds its unamortized carrying amount 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the appropriate risk weighted discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated net future cash flows  prepayment speeds that will determine the amount and period of servicing revenue that is expected to be earned  estimated costs to service the loans and estimated interest earned on amounts collected for real estate tax and property insurance premiums that are held in escrow until payment is due 
these assumptions are based upon actual performance of the underlying loans and the general market consensus regarding changes in mortgage and other interest rates 
for example  declining mortgage interest rates typically result in accelerated mortgage prepayments  which tend to shorten the life and reduce the value of the servicing rights asset 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  materially different amortization and valuation allowances than those that were recorded may be required 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of mortgage servicing rights it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected their fair value by ten percent beyond their carrying value  an additional impairment charge of million would have been necessary

loan securitizations and sale of receivables the company periodically sells certain indirect automobile loans in securitization transactions 
upon the sale  the net carrying amount of the loans are removed from the consolidated balance sheet in exchange for cash and certain retained residual interests 
the retained interests include rights to service the loans that are sold the servicing rights and an interest in residual cash flows the interest only strip 
the interest only strip includes the excess of interest collected on the loans over the amount required to be paid to the investors and the securitization agent the excess spread plus an interest in sales proceeds that are not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans to the extent it exceeds projected credit losses the credit enhancement or overcollateralization 
the carrying value of the loans removed from the balance sheet includes the unpaid principal balance of the loans  net of an allocable portion of the allowance for loan 
table of contents losses  minus the portion of the carrying value of the loans that are allocated to the retained residual interests 
these allocations are based upon the relative fair values of the retained residual interests and the loans sold 
because they are retained assets  the amount allocated and recorded for the residual interests has a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized upon the sale of the loans 
since the projected income from the servicing rights has approximated what is considered adequate compensation for servicing the loans  no asset or liability is recorded for servicing rights 
income from servicing is recognized as earned pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreement and to the extent cash collections from the borrowers exceed payments to the investors and agent 
cash collections in excess of the servicing rights income that is earned is next applied to the interest only strip 
the value allocated to the interest only strip is reduced and interest income is recorded assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the excess spread will be fully amortized 
at that time the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the overcollateralization will have accreted to the amount of the sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans less credit losses and excess overcollateralization subsequently released to the company by the securitization trust because it exceeded contractual requirements 
at that time  remaining cash is expected to be released by the securitization trust in an amount that equals the accreted value of the overcollateralization 
because the company s retained residual interests are subordinated to the interests of securitization investors and the trust agent  there is risk that the carrying value of the interest only strip will not be fully recovered  which would result in a charge to earnings 
these include the risk the asset will have a shorter life than originally estimated prepayment risk  that actual credit losses may exceed expected credit losses credit risk and that interest paid to the securitization trust and investors will be greater than projected interest rate risk 
the company s risk of loss attributable to credit and prepayment is limited to its interest in the interest only strip 
neither the investors nor the securitization trust have any further recourse to the company s other assets 
interest rate risk could exceed the company s interest in the excess spread  but such a possibility is considered remote as of december  each reporting period  the fair value of the interest only strip is evaluated based upon current estimates and assumptions of the net present value of residual future cash flows net of remaining expected credit losses and anticipated releases of overcollateralization 
changes in fair value are generally recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income oci 
if this evaluation results in fair values that are less than the amortized carrying value of the interest only strip  and if the decline is considered other than temporary  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets  the decline is charged against earnings for the current period 
finally  each reporting period  new interest only strip amortization schedules are developed based upon current estimates  assumptions  adjusted carrying values and revised constant yields 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are estimated defaults  delinquencies and credit losses  projected prepayment speeds  projected interest rates  and discount rates 
these assumptions are based upon demonstrated credit performance  the prepayment history of the underlying loans and market consensus on future interest rates 
these are  in turn  most highly influenced by general economic conditions  with the greatest adverse effect during economic downturns and periods of rapidly changing interest rates 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  noticeably different results could occur because the recorded value of the interest only strip may need to be written off or written down faster than planned and cash flows from the retained residual interests may be less than expected 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of the interest only strip it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected their value by an additional ten percent and the 
table of contents decline was determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge of million would have been necessary

table of contents statements  effective for the company s third quarter the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the standard  but anticipates that it will result in a reduction in earnings and earnings per share beginning with the third quarter of earnings review of consolidated statements of income the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest income on certain loans and investment securities is not subject to federal income tax 
for analytical purposes  the interest income and rates on these types of assets are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent  or fte basis 
the fte adjustment was calculated using amcore s statutory federal income tax rate of 
overview fte adjusted interest income is as follows in thousands years ended december  interest income book basis fte adjustment interest income fte basis interest expense net interest income fte basis net interest income on an fte basis increased million or in and increased million or in the increases for both and were driven by increases in average loan volumes of and  respectively  and reductions in total interest expense of and  respectively 
net interest spread is the difference between the average rates on interest earning assets and the average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 
these ratios can also be used to analyze net interest income 
since a portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits  other liabilities and stockholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funding sources is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 
as table indicates  the net interest spread improved basis points to in from in  which was an eight basis point increase from the level of 
the net interest margin was in  an increase of five basis points from in the level was an increase of one basis point from in the level of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the total volume and mix of interest earning assets and the rates earned and the total volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the rates paid 
the rate and volume components associated with interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be segregated to analyze the period to period changes in net interest income 
changes due to rate volume variances have been allocated between changes due to average volume and changes due to average rate based on the absolute value of each to the total change of both categories 
because of changes in the mix of the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the computations for each of the components do not equal 
table of contents the calculation for interest earning assets as a total  or interest bearing liabilities as a total 
table analyzes the changes attributable to the volume and rate components of net interest income 
changes due to volume in  net interest income fte increased due to average volume by million when compared to this increase was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
in  net interest income fte increased due to average volume by million 
this was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income of million was driven by a million or increase in average loans and a million or increase in average investment securities 
the growth in average loans came from an increase of million in commercial lending driven mostly by the branch expansion 
average consumer loan balances declined million compared to the prior year  largely due to the auto loan sales  and to family real estate loans declined million 
the growth in average investment securities was primarily attributable to mortgage backed securities as the company sought to replace mortgage related assets that prepaid during the mortgage re financing boom in and and pre funding of expected cash flows from mortgage backed securities 
the increase in average loans and investment securities was funded by a million or increase in average bank issued deposits and a million or increase in average wholesale fundings  which included a million increase in wholesale deposits 
the increase in average bank issued deposits was attributable to the company s deposit growth and branch expansion initiatives 
the increase in interest income of million was driven by a million or increase in average loans offset by a decline of million or in average investment securities 
the growth in average loans was attributable to an increase of million in commercial lending  driven mostly by the branch expansion  and a million increase in average consumer loans 
partially offsetting these increases was an million average decline in residential real estate loans  due to the impact of refinancings  as fixed mortgage interest rates reached year lows 
strong loan growth  particularly in new markets  allowed the company to reshape its balance sheet to an improved mix of earning assets 
this  along with accelerated prepayments of mortgage backed securities associated with the mortgage re financing boom  contributed to the decline in average investment securities 
changes due to rate during  net interest income fte increased due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million decline in interest income that was more than offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
during  net interest income fte declined due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million decrease in interest income that was partly offset by a million decline in interest expense 
during  the yield on earning assets declined basis points compared to this was comprised of a basis point decline in the yield on average loans and basis point decline in the yield on average investment securities 
four basis point increases in the federal funds fed funds rate that occurred during the second half of were insufficient in terms of magnitude and length of time in effect to offset the negative impact on re financing and re pricing of loans and investment securities of a basis point decline in the national prime rate that occurred from january through june the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities declined basis points during  compared to this was primarily due to decreased rates paid on certificates of deposit cds  including brokered cds  as older cds bearing higher rates matured and re priced during the period of lower interest rates and not yet fully impacted by recent increases in the fed funds rate 
in  the yield on earning assets declined basis points compared to the yield on average securities fell by basis points  while the yield on average loans fell by basis points 
the decline in security yields 
table of contents was affected by the prepayment of higher yielding mortgage related securities  including accelerated premium amortization  which occurred as mortgage interest rates fell 
proceeds were reinvested  but in lower yielding securities due to the low interest rate environment 
while nearly all loan categories were affected  the largest dollar decline was attributable to commercial real estate loans 
loans that refinanced during the year  variable priced loans and new loan production were all adversely impacted by the reductions in interest rates that had been in decline since january of the rate on average interest bearing liabilities declined basis points during compared to  due to lower bank issued deposit  wholesale deposit  short term and long term borrowing rates 
while rates fell on all deposit products  the decrease was most pronounced on cd s 
average rates on cd s declined as older cd s bearing higher rates matured and re priced following the decline in interest rates that occurred over the previous three years 
the company also benefited from an expired interest rate swap that had increased funding costs in  as well as new swaps entered into during that lowered the cost of wholesale deposits during the decrease in borrowing rates was largely the result of lower rates paid on reverse repurchase agreements that renewed at lower rates as short term interest rates declined 
the company expects a modest improvement in net interest margin in among those factors that could cause margin and spread not to perform as anticipated by the company include greater and more frequent than anticipated changes in interest rates  including the impact of basis risk between various interest rate indices  changes in the shape of the yield curve  the effect of prepayments or renegotiated rates  increased price competition on both deposits and loans  changes in the mix of earning assets and the mix of liabilities  including greater than anticipated use of expensive wholesale sources to fund the branch expansion and greater than expected loan delinquencies resulting in non accrual status 
the company is liability sensitive over a one year horizon  meaning that interest bearing liabilities are expected to re price more quickly than interest earning assets 
if the federal reserve board were to increase the fed funds rate more aggressively than anticipated by the company  there could be some modest stress in net interest margin 
provision for loan losses the provision see critical accounting estimates discussion was million  a decrease of million or from million in reduced loan concentration concerns  lower net charge offs  improved economic conditions  lower delinquencies and non accrual loans and improved credit quality due to increasing experience in branch expansion markets and expanded workout collection activities were all factors contributing to the reduction in provision 
the reduced loan concentration concerns primarily related to improved credit quality and industry outlook for loans concentrated in the non residential building operators and the general farms dairy portfolios 
net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans in  compared to million or basis points of average loans in the million provision for was a million or increase compared to a provision of million in increases in net charge offs  higher specific loss estimates on individually reviewed loans  increased concentration concerns  increasing loan balances in emerging markets  higher levels of delinquencies and continued economic weakness were all among the factors leading to the increased provision 
net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans in  compared to million or basis points of average loans in the increased concentration concerns primarily related to higher delinquencies and loans graded as potential problem  substandard or doubtful in the health services portfolio 
non interest income total non interest income is comprised primarily of fee based revenues from trust and asset management  bank related service charges on deposits and mortgage banking income 
net security gains or losses  gain on auto loan sales and branch sales  increases in cash surrender value csv and death benefits on bank and 
table of contents company owned life insurance coli  brokerage commission income and bankcard fee income are also included in this category 
overview for  non interest income totaled million  a decline of million or from million in the decline was primarily attributable to an million reduction in mortgage banking income and million of branch gains that occurred in for  non interest income was million  an increase of million or from million in the increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in mortgage banking income  million of branch gains and million of auto loan sales gains in trust and asset management income trust and asset management income includes trust  investment management  employee benefit recordkeeping and administration services 
it also includes advisory and fund administration fees from the vintage mutual funds and various public fund programs 
trust and asset management income has historically been the company s largest source of non interest income and totaled million in this was a decrease of million or from million in this followed a decrease of million or from million in the decline for was primarily attributable to lower advisory  management and administration fees from public fund clients  including the loss of a major public fund customer in the fourth quarter of and two large retirement plans in  the loss and migration of business associated with poor investment performance of the vintage equity funds and a move to an open architecture platform  as well as increased price competition 
partly offsetting these factors was a recovery in the equity markets that positively impacted the value of amcore administered assets  upon which fees are partially based 
the decline in was primarily due to declining equity markets over the preceding three years that challenged the investment industry with the s p losing of its value from to these declines negatively impacted the value of amcore administered assets  upon which fees are partially based  leading to the decrease in fee revenue 
also contributing to the decline was the loss of the major public fund customer effective october  and the loss and migration of business associated with poor investment performance of the vintage equity funds 
as noted above  increasing trust and asset management income is a key initiative of the company that is directed at reversing the declines 
changes that have been made and that are under consideration as a result of this initiative are expected to improve the long term bottom line impact of this important source of non interest income 
as of december   total assets under administration were billion  which includes million in the vintage mutual funds  compared to billion and million  respectively  as of december  in addition to overall market performance  trust and asset management revenues are dependent upon the company s ability to attract and retain accounts  specific investment performance and other economic factors 
fees from money market mutual funds  which comprise approximately of managed assets  can also be negatively affected by a low short term interest rate environment 
at low levels  investors may seek alternative investments 
thus  waivers of fees on money market mutual funds have been  and may continue to be  required to provide more competitive returns for investors as a means of inducing investors to maintain their level of investments 
waivers were   and virtually none in  and  respectively 
mortgage banking income mortgage banking income includes fees generated from the underwriting  originating and servicing of mortgage loans along with gains realized from the sale of these loans  net of origination costs  servicing rights amortization and impairment 
for  mortgage banking income was million  a decline of million from million in the decline included a  mortgage servicing rights impairment charge in  compared to a million impairment reversal in excluding impairment charges and reversals  mortgage banking income declined million driven by a decline in closings to million in  from million in these declines were expected  as rising mortgage interest rates led to decreased refinancing activity 
however  the company still expects continued growth in new purchase mortgages as a result of additional mortgage 
table of contents originators  primarily in the branch expansion markets 
new purchase mortgage growth could be negatively affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control  including heightened competition  higher mortgage interest rates  declines in new housing construction and adverse regulatory developments 
new purchase mortgage closings were million or of total closings in  compared to million or of total closings in for  mortgage banking income was up million or from million in contributing to the increase was the million impairment reversal in compared to an impairment charge of million in excluding impairment charges and reversals  mortgage banking income increased million reflecting record closing volumes of million that were driven by refinancings in the wake of declining mortgage interest rates 
the million was a increase from million of closings in as of december   the carrying value of amcore s capitalized mortgage servicing rights was million  net of a  impairment valuation allowance 
this compares to million at december   and no impairment valuation allowance 
the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others was billion as of december  this compares to billion as of december  the net carrying value of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights  as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others  was and as of december  and  respectively 
coli income coli income totaled million in  a million or decline from million in this contrasts with a million or increase in from million in the decrease in from was primarily due to a  negative adjustment in attributable to a change in estimate in a policy s csv provided by the carrier  which reversed a positive estimate of value adjustment in  declines in the value of underlying variable return investments  lower underlying investment rates and the impact of death benefit pay outs 
the increase over included the impact of interest compounding  higher average investments year over year and net death benefits received in amcore uses coli as a tax advantaged means of financing its future obligations with respect to certain non qualified retirement and deferred compensation plans in addition to other employee benefit programs 
as of december   the csv of coli was million  compared to million at december  other non interest income for  service charges on deposits  brokerage commission income  bankcard fee income  gain on sale of branches  gain on sale of loans  net security gains and other non interest income totaled million  a million or decline from the decrease was primarily attributable to the million branch gain in the and lower net security gains  net of increased service charges on deposit income  brokerage commission income  bankcard fee income and other income 
other income included derivatives mark to market gains in compared to losses in and increased customer service charge income 
from to  these same categories increased million or 
the increase was primarily due to the million branch gains and the million auto loan sales gain that occurred in recent litigation involving mastercard and visa concerning the amount of fees charged to process signature based debit card transactions is expected to reduce the amount of interchange income that amcore receives on the debit cards that it issues 
rate reductions of approximately became effective august  effective january   merchants were permitted to refuse signature based debit card transactions 
this may result in future reductions in interchange income 
for  the company s bankcard fee income increased  to million from million in the increase was primarily due to a larger cardholder base  a benefit of both the branch expansion and deposit growth initiatives  and greater card utilization that have more than offset the rate reduction 
while some merchants have altered their point of sale practices to discourage signature based debit card transactions  many merchants have been slow to refuse acceptance altogether

effective tax rates are lower than the statutory tax rates due primarily to investments in tax exempt municipal bonds and increases in csv and death benefits on coli that are not taxable 
the increase in effective tax rate in and over the prior respective years is primarily due to a decrease in the size of these tax exempt items relative to total pre tax earnings

earnings review by business segment amcore s internal reporting and planning process focuses on four primary lines of business segment s commercial banking  retail banking  trust and asset management  and mortgage banking 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents a condensed income statement and total assets for each segment 
the financial information presented was derived from the company s internal profitability reporting system that is used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the company 
this information is based on internal management accounting policies which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the segments and  to the extent practicable  to portray each segment as if it operated on a stand alone basis 
thus  each segment  in addition to its direct revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  includes an allocation of shared support function expenses 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments also include funds transfer adjustments to appropriately reflect the cost of funds on loans made and funding credits on deposits generated 
apart from these adjustments  the accounting policies used are similar to those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since there are no comprehensive authorities for management accounting equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles  the information presented is not necessarily comparable with similar information from other financial institutions 
in addition  methodologies used to measure  assign and allocate certain items may change from time to time to reflect  among other things  accounting estimate refinements  changes in risk profiles  changes in customers or product lines  and changes in management structure 
total segment results differ from consolidated results primarily due to inter segment eliminations  certain corporate administration costs  items not otherwise allocated in the management accounting process and treasury and investment activities 
the impact of these items is aggregated to reconcile the amounts presented for the segments to the consolidated results and is included in the other column of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its normal operations  amcore is subject to interest rate risk on the interest earning assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the interest bearing liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds  as well as its ability to manage such risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market values of amcore s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
in the near term  amcore expects that its interest rate risk will be greater should interest rates decline 
while amcore manages other risks in its normal course of operations  such as credit and liquidity risk  it considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of amcore s business activities and operations 
in addition  since amcore does not hold a trading portfolio  it is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
during  there were no material changes in amcore s primary market risk exposures 
based upon current expectations  no material changes are anticipated in the future in the types of market risks facing amcore 
table and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize amcore s market risk and interest sensitivity position as of december  the amounts and assumptions should not be relied upon as indicative of expected actual results since  like most financial institutions  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by external factors

amcore s asset and liability management process is utilized to manage market and interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet and off balance sheet positions to maximize net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of risk to changes in market interest rates 
while achievement of this goal requires a balance between earnings  liquidity and interest rate risk  there are opportunities to enhance revenues through managed risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is performed monthly using various simulations with an asset liability modeling system 
these analyses are reviewed by the asset and liability committee alco  whose actions attempt to minimize any sudden or sustained negative impact that interest rate movements may have on net interest income 
alco reviews the impact of liquidity  capital adequacy and rate sensitivity  among other things  and determines appropriate policy direction to maintain or meet established alco guidelines 
based upon an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve  the potential decrease in net interest income for would be approximately  or of base forecasted net interest income 
this analysis assumes no growth in assets or liabilities and replacement of maturing instruments with like kind instruments 
at the end of  comparable assumptions would have resulted in a potential decrease in net interest income of  or 
thus  amcore s earnings at risk for rising rates has increased since the end of  as the company moved from an asset sensitive position to a slightly liability sensitive position 
conversely  an immediate decrease in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve would result in a potential decrease in net interest income for of million or of base forecasted net interest income 
at the end of  a similar decrease in rates would have resulted in a potential decrease in net interest income of million or 
amcore s sensitivity to declining interest rates has decreased since the end of with the recent increases in rates  all points on the yield curve are now being shocked down the full basis points 
amcore continues to have rate compression on non maturity deposits 

table of contents factors that contribute to the continued negative sensitivity to declining interest rates include the negative convexity of the mortgage backed products and the larger volume of floating rate commercial loans 
the amounts and assumptions used in the rising and falling rate scenarios should not be viewed as indicative of expected actual results 
in addition to rising or falling interest rates  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by a variety of external factors  such as those previously noted 
in addition  as interest rates move  the alco is likely to adjust interest rate risk management strategies to limit  to the extent possible  the adverse impact that such changes in interest rates might otherwise have on amcore s net interest income  as well as maximize potential positive impacts such movements might have
