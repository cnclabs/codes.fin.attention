generally about percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices  personal care  and lawn care 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
the remaining percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
market conditions during  higher petrochemical feedstock costs significantly increased the price of polymer resins and adhesives  the primary raw materials for our business segments 
our business model has been developed to accommodate such cost increases by adjusting selling prices to reflect increased costs 
in addition  we focus on marketing value added  unique materials and customer service that cannot be easily duplicated by our competition 
during the year  we experienced increased customer demand for innovative packaging and pressure sensitive solutions  reflecting a strengthening economy and our customers focus on new product introductions 
restructuring and related charges during the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program in which three flexible packaging plants were closed 
this program eliminated less efficient capacity and consolidated production of monolayer blown film into fewer  more efficient facilities 
while most of the restructuring activities were completed as of december   gains and losses related to the sale of these closed facilities resulted in a net gain of million during during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program for our pressure sensitive materials business segment to reduce capacity and fixed costs associated with our label materials product line 
the majority of the restructuring activities were completed by the second quarter of restructuring charges totaled million in the fourth quarter of and million in acquisitions our acquisitions strategy is growth oriented  focused on the identification of businesses that offer unique packaging technologies  access to new markets or product lines  or critical mass 
since the beginning of  we have completed four such acquisitions to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our business segments 
these four acquisitions have added about million of net sales  about two thirds of which is from non us manufacturing plants 
our non us plants are focused on serving the flexible packaging needs of the geographic regions in which each plant resides 
these acquisitions are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on may   bemis and our mexican joint venture partner completed the purchase of certain flexible packaging assets of masterpak sa de sa  including a converting facility in tultitl n  mexico 
these assets produce flexible packaging for dry foods  personal care products  pharmaceuticals  confectionery and bakery products 
annual sales related to the assets acquired were approximately million 
we own percent of the acquired business  which will focus on supplying the packaging needs of mexican food and consumer goods markets 
on january   subsequent to year end  we acquired majority ownership of dixie toga sa  one of the largest packaging companies in south america with annual revenues in excess of million 
the acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of dixie toga in addition to percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock 
the cash purchase price was approximately million 
this acquisition significantly increases our exposure to the growing south american packaging market and provides a strong platform from which to introduce our propriety film products to a new region 
since  bemis and dixie toga have operated a joint venture in brazil  known as itap bemis ltda  and have established a successful working relationship 
dixie toga has a strong regional management team  a business model similar to bemis and growing  profitable operations 
we expect this acquisition to have a positive impact on our financial results in results of operations consolidated overview for the year ended december   net sales increased percent to billion  compared to billion for the year ended december  acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of accounted for percent of the percent increase in net sales while currency translation accounted for percent 
increased unit sales in both business segments drove a percent increase in net sales during the year  while price and mix accounted for the remaining percent increase 
demand for innovative packaging for a variety of food categories such as meat and cheese  frozen foods  confectionery products and snack foods led flexible packaging volumes  while technical products drove an increase in pressure sensitive materials 
net sales in increased percent from net sales of billion in acquisitions accounted for percent of the net sales growth  while currency translation accounted for about percent 
the remaining percent sales growth reflects primarily the increased sales volumes in flexible packaging during operating profit increased to million in from million in and million in operating profit in reflects a million gain on the sale of an in house rotogravure graphics plant 
in addition  restructuring and related charges included in operating profit totaled million and million in and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the plant and any restructuring charges  operating profit would have been million for  an increase of percent from million for there were no restructuring charges during cost savings in resulting from the completed restructuring programs were partially offset by increased pension expense 
sales mix improvements resulted in increased operating profit during during  competitive pricing pressures for flexible packaging products sold into industrial markets and for pressure sensitive label materials  in addition to increases in certain resin costs  contributed to lower margins 
net income totaled million in  million in  and million in diluted earnings per share were for  including restructuring and related charges of about per share 
results for also reflect a gain of per share on the sale of rotogravure plant assets during the fourth quarter of the year 
for  diluted earnings per share were  including restructuring and related charges of about per share 
diluted earnings per share for totaled 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including meat and cheese  confectionery  frozen foods  lawn and garden  personal care  beverages  medical devices  bakery and snack foods 
these markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion 
the most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins  which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products 
during periods of unusual raw material cost volatility  selling price changes may lag behind changes in our raw material costs 
during  resin costs steadily increased  resulting in double digit percentage increases by year end 
these raw material costs were reflected in increased selling prices during the year 
during  polyethylene resin prices increased percent during the first quarter in anticipation of natural gas shortages due to conflict in the middle east and other international supply concerns 
as concerns subsided in april  prices drifted back down  resulting in a volatile pricing period that delayed our ability to adjust selling prices  which negatively impacted operating margins 
in july  we announced a restructuring effort to reduce fixed costs  take out monolayer film capacity and direct production volume to more efficient facilities 
we closed three flexible packaging manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of  recording restructuring and related charges of million during of this total charge  million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and was classified as costs of products sold 
the remaining million of charges included million for employee severance and related costs and million of other costs  primarily equipment relocation  all of which have been recorded as other costs income  net 
with the flexible packaging restructuring efforts essentially completed at december   the net restructuring gain of million classified as other costs income  net  in relates primarily to the sale of closed facilities offset by ongoing costs to maintain these closed facilities 
our flexible packaging business segment recorded net sales of billion in  a percent increase from billion in the acquisition of the flexible packaging assets of masterpak  a mexican joint venture investment made during the second quarter of  contributed percent sales growth 
currency translation accounted for a percent increase in sales  primarily reflecting the impact of our exposure to the strengthening euro 
strong unit sales to markets for meat and cheese  confectionery and snack foods  frozen foods  personal care products  cereal products and unitizing film for products such as bottled water was partially offset by lower unit sales to bakery  pet product and industrial markets 
price and mix increased sales by about percent in total  as customers balanced price increases with changes in product mix 
net sales increased percent in from billion in acquisitions accounted for an increase of percent and currency translation accounted for percent of the improvement from operating profit increased to million in compared to million in and million in operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in compared to percent in operating profit was percent in during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in florence  kentucky that supported internal rotogravure graphics capabilities 
excluding the impact of both the gain on the sale of that facility as well as restructuring charges  operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been percent in compared to percent in savings resulting from the restructuring program were significantly offset by increased pension costs and incentive compensation in in addition  operating losses from the newly acquired joint venture in mexico totaled million in where resolution of supplier issues and deferred maintenance activities related to the previous ownership is continuing 
factors that dampened flexible packaging operating profits in included increased employee pension and other benefit costs and unusual volatility in the price of polyethylene resin during the first half of the year 
pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  battery  construction and medical industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions have had a greater negative influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
during  the increased cost of petrochemical products caused an associated increase in the cost of adhesive materials  in addition to a concern about availability of adhesive from suppliers 
in response to these cost increases  we increased selling prices and secured alternative supplies of raw materials in case of shortages 
we focused on margin expansion by introducing new product innovations and quality initiatives during the year 
in addition  recent restructuring activities resulted in better capacity utilization in label products 
in october of  we announced the restructuring of our label products capacity 
we closed two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization in our label products line 
restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in  of which million related to severance and related charges and was recorded as other costs income  net 
the remaining million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and related charges and was recorded as an element of costs of products sold 
during  restructuring and related charges totaling million related primarily to the cost of closing a label products plant in nevada 
of this total  million related to costs and equipment relocation and was recorded as other costs income  net  with the remaining costs associated with accelerated depreciation charged to costs of products sold 
our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported net sales of million in  an increase of percent from net sales of million in an acquisition in the fourth quarter of of a graphic business in europe increased net sales by percent during and currency translation provided a percent increase 
about percent of the sales from this business segment are from our manufacturing operations in belgium  which benefited from the strengthening of the european currencies during stronger unit sales of technical products more than offset slightly lower unit sales of label and graphic products compared to price and mix provided a combined improvement to net sales during the year of about percent 
net sales in increased percent from million in  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro during operating profit increased substantially in to million or percent of net sales  compared to million or percent of net sales in  and million or percent of net sales in excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges  operating profit would have been million or percent of net sales in  and million or percent of net sales in currency translation contributed million to operating profit in and million in improved profit levels in reflect improved sales mix and the savings associated with restructuring activities early in the year  partially offset by increased pension expense 
during  label product markets were very competitive  as reduced selling prices offset much of the benefits of improving production volume during the year 
gross margin gross margin as a percent of net sales increased to percent in compared to percent in gross margin was percent in restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by million in and million in lower margins in reflect the impact of higher resin costs in advance of selling price increases and an increased proportion of lower margin non us sales 
we are implementing improvements in europe and mexico to increase profitability at those locations 
during  unusual volatility in raw material prices for flexible packaging products coupled with pricing pressure in markets for certain commodity like products caused margins to decline from levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were percent for  compared to percent for both and total expenses were million in  million in  and million in increased expenses for reflect the larger sales organization associated with our global sales efforts and an increase from in broad based incentive compensation and pension expense 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased slightly in to million compared to million in expenses in totaled million 
our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness and relevance of our research and developments activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
interest expense substantially all of our outstanding debt for each of the three years presented was subject to variable interest rates 
during  short term interest rates increased gradually from about percent at december  to about percent at december  the impact of this increase in short term interest rates was partially offset by a million decrease in outstanding debt during interest expense increased in to million compared to million in during  we recorded interest expense of million  reflecting lower interest rates but higher outstanding debt levels 
we expect interest expense to increase substantially in due to increasing short term interest rates and higher debt levels 
on january   we acquired a brazilian packaging company for which we assumed about million in interest bearing debt and borrowed approximately million to complete the acquisition 
other costs income  net we reported net other income of million in  reflecting a million gain on the sale of a rotogravure facility during the fourth quarter partially offset by restructuring and related charges of million 
equity income from our brazilian joint venture was million in  reflecting improved profitability in addition to an increase in our equity ownership from percent to percent in january the remainder of other income in is primarily interest income 
during  net other costs of million included million of restructuring and related charges related to employee severance and the closure of manufacturing facilities 
the brazilian joint venture accounted for million of equity income during net other income of million in was primarily related to interest income 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in the difference between our overall tax rate and the u 
s 
statutory tax rate of percent in each of those three years principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources credit rating at year end the company had long term credit ratings of a from standard poor s and a from moody s investors service  and a credit rating of a and p for our commercial paper program from standard poor s and moody s investor service  respectively 
our financial position and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
on january   we acquired the outstanding voting common stock and percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock of dixie toga sa for a cash price of approximately million 
the acquisition was initially financed with commercial paper 
we intend to refinance a portion of our commercial paper during the first half of in july  million of existing public bonds will mature and we expect to refinance this debt with available commercial paper capacity 
in conjunction with the january acquisition  the credit rating agencies have reviewed the ratings that they have assigned to our debt 
standard poor s has confirmed their ratings of a and a for our long term senior unsecured debt and commercial paper  respectively 
on march   moody s investor service reduced our long term senior unsecured debt credit rating to baa and reduced our commercial paper rating to p sources of liquidity cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in cash provided by operations in and was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our us pension plans of million and million  respectively 
while no contributions are required for or  we continue to monitor the funded status of our us pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity 
increased raw material costs during resulted in increased levels of working capital  which had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during the second half of the year 
in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
in early january the amount of outstanding commercial paper increased substantially as a direct result of the acquisition of dixie toga sa based upon our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
while not anticipated  if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper  we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility 
in september  we renegotiated our back up credit facility to extend the term to september of the previous credit facility included a revolving credit agreement where the company could borrow up to million through august our new credit facility provides million of available financing supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition to funds available under this credit facility  we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately million of extendable commercial notes ecns  which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to days from the date of issuance 
previously the company had a day credit agreement under which the company could borrow up to million 
if these new credit facilities and ecns were no longer available to us  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
long term debt commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related back up credit agreement expires in in july  public bonds totaling million will mature 
we intend to refinance those bonds with commercial paper 
uses of liquidity capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in and million in during  we invested in additional capacity for our european operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and to provide a platform to introduce new proprietary film products 
capital expenditures for are expected to be in the million to million range 
increased expenditures for primarily relate to capacity needs in north american operations 
after  capital expenditures are expected to return to levels approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share from cents per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the nd consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases we did not make any share repurchases during the three years presented 
as of december   management is authorized to purchase up to million shares of common stock for the treasury 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of december  contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years debt payments capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension contributions amount noted includes estimated interest costs 
long term and short term debt obligations  excluding interest  are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on september  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters 
amount noted includes estimated interest costs 
the present value of these obligations  excluding interest  is included on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payments terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
our operating lease obligations are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
amount noted is funding requirements of non us pension plans 
no requirements exist for future funding 
interest rate swaps our long term unsecured notes include million due in july and million due in august in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with three us banks  which increased our exposure to variable rates 
we generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term 
these interest rate swap agreements  which expire in and  reduced the interest cost of the million of long term debt from about percent to about percent in since these variable rates are based upon six month london interbank offered rates libor  calculated in arrears  at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of total debt outstanding would increase by million 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that the fair value of these swaps  which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding  be recorded as an asset or liability of the company 
the fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of million at december   and an asset of million at december  for each period  an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding 
these fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes  nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates  establish rates for future issuance of public bonds  and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of total debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  principally for transactions in non euro zone countries 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months and relate primarily to major western european currencies 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million or percent from operating profit improved by approximately million as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation during long term compensation while our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period  we have also granted some stock options in the past 
beginning in  we discontinued the awarding of stock options 
stock options granted prior to were granted at prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and exercisable  upon vesting  over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant 
stock options for directors vested immediately  while options for company employees become vested over three years one third per year 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock options  we disclose the impact on net income and earnings per share of stock options outstanding  as if compensation expense were measured using a fair value method  in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements 
beginning july   accounting rules will require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options 
if we followed this fair value method during  diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by one cent for the year ended  two cents for the year ended  and one cent for the year ended we expect the impact to diluted earnings per share for to be insignificant 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for annual pension costs we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we use a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below 
sfas no 
requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income or expense be amortized over future periods 
pension expense recorded in was million  compared to pension expense of million in and pension income of million in we expect pension expense to be comparable to the levels of one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
as of january   for our us defined benefit pension plans  we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be percent 
this represents a decrease from the percent level assumed for and percent level assumed for to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
using historical long term investment periods of  and years  our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of percent  percent and percent  respectively  each in excess of our assumed rates 
in future years  we expect that returns will be lower than the historical returns discussed above due to a generally lower inflation and interest rate environment 
considering this  we selected an percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of january  using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one half of one percent from the percent rate used at december  pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based upon current assumptions of percent for the discount rate and percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
total increase decrease total increase decrease to pension expense to pension expense in millions from current assumptions from current assumptions discount rate rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent current assumption percent percent percent percent percent percent the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the minimum pension liability adjustment on equity  net of tax  resulting from changes in the assumed discount rate 
total increase decrease in equity from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent if the discount rate had been reduced to percent at december   the accumulated benefit obligation for the largest of the defined benefit pension plans would have exceeded the related plan assets 
this would then have required a minimum pension liability adjustment with a corresponding reduction to equity  net of tax  of about million 
a further decrease in the discount rate to percent would only result in an additional equity adjustment of million 
intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which will significantly change accounting practice with respect to employee stock options 
fas r requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
a public entity will initially measure the cost of liability based service awards based on its current fair value  the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the company expects that the impact of adopting this standard will be insignificant to the company s results of operation 
on november   the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
the standard adopts the international accounting standards board iasb view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred 
additionally  the board made the decision to clarify the meaning of the term normal capacity 
the provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not determined the impact of this sfas no 
to its inventory accounting results which may result upon adoption of this statement on january  in december  the fasb issued fasb staff positions fsp no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 
this fsp provides guidance on how an enterprise should account for the deduction for qualified production activities provided by the american jobs act of we are currently evaluating the impact of this new deduction  the benefit of which will be considered in our future tax provisions 
in december  the fasb also issued fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 
this fsp allows additional time for companies to determine how the new law affects a company s accounting for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings 
the new law provides for a special one time deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated and which meet certain requirements 
we are currently evaluating whether any of the earnings of our non us operations will be repatriated in accordance with the terms of this law 
subsequent events on january   bemis announced that it had acquired majority ownership of dixie toga sa  one of the largest packaging companies in south america and bemis brazil based partner in the itap bemis ltda 
joint venture 
in this transaction  we acquired the outstanding voting common stock and percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock of dixie toga for a total cash price of approximately million 
the purchase price was initially financed with commercial paper and  combined with a small amount of debt assumed in the acquisition  our debt to total capitalization ratio increased on the acquisition date to approximately percent
