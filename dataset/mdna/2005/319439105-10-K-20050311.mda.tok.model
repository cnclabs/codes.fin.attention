overview the corporation is a bank holding company established as a north carolina corporation in  with one wholly owned banking subsidiary  fcb 
the corporation s principal executive offices are located in charlotte  north carolina 
fcb is a full service bank and trust company with financial centers and seven insurance offices located in counties throughout the piedmont and western half of north carolina 
the corporation also maintains operations in reston  virginia for the origination of real estate loans 
these operations also serve as a holding company for certain subsidiaries that own real estate and real estate related assets  including first and second residential mortgage loans 
the corporation s primary market area is located within north carolina and predominately centers around the metro region of charlotte  north carolina  including mecklenburg county and its surrounding counties 
charlotte is the twenty sixth largest city in the united states and has a diverse economic base 
primary business sectors in the charlotte metro region include banking and finance  insurance  manufacturing  health care  transportation  retail  telecommunications  government services and education 
the corporation believes that it is not dependent on any one or a few types of commerce due to the region s diverse economic base 
since the north carolina economy has historically relied on the manufacturing and transportation sectors  it has been significantly impacted by global competition and rising energy prices 
as a result  the north carolina economy is transitioning to a more service oriented economy 
recently  the education  healthcare  information technology  finance and business services industries have shown the most growth 
the unemployment rate for the charlotte metro region was percent in december compared to percent in december this decrease is the result of structural changes taking place in the economy of the region 
the service industry is now the major employer in the charlotte metro region  followed by wholesale and retail trade 
the corporation s operations are divided into five primary lines of business community banking  mortgage  brokerage  insurance  and financial management 
community banking provides a variety of depository accounts including interest bearing and noninterest bearing checking accounts  certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
in addition  community banking offers numerous loan products including commercial  consumer  real estate and home equity loans 
the community bank also maintains atm s and enables customers to access their accounts on line 
the mortgage business provides both fixed rate and variable rate mortgage products and loan servicing pursuant to a third party arrangement 
first charter brokerage services offers full service and discount brokerage services  annuity sales and financial planning services pursuant to a third party arrangement with uvest investment services 
first charter insurance services  inc is a north carolina corporation formed to meet the insurance needs of businesses and individuals throughout the charlotte metro region 
financial management provides comprehensive financial planning  funds management  investments and record keeping services for many national companies 
the corporation derives interest income through traditional banking activities such as generating loans and earning interest on securities 
additional sources of income are derived from fees on deposit accounts and from the corporation s various lines of business including mortgage  brokerage  insurance and financial management 
also  as a part of the corporation s management of its securities portfolio  income is recognized on the sale of bond and equity securities 
increasing the net interest income is critical to the corporation s strategy of earnings growth in a rising rate environment 
there are three primary components to achieve this goal maintain an asset sensitive balance sheet  improve the net interest margin and increase earning assets 
the first component involves the corporation maintaining an asset sensitive balance sheet under a broad range of interest rate scenarios 
this has been accomplished by managing the level of fixed rate loans and focusing on variable rate lending 
a balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its assets loans and securities reprice faster or to a greater extent than liabilities deposits and borrowings 
an asset sensitive balance sheet will produce more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when interest rates decline 
the second component toward achieving an increase in net interest income is improving the net interest margin 
enhancing the net interest margin is divided into two parts  improving asset yields and reducing funding costs 
the yields in the corporation s loan portfolio should increase as the corporation s floating rate and variable rate loans reprice upward with the increase in interest rates 
in addition  rising interest rates will increase the effective yields on mortgage backed securities by decreasing the amortization of premiums due to slowing prepayment speeds 
the corporation continues its focus on reducing funding costs by growing deposit balances and shifting funding sources from higher cost retail certificates of deposit to lower cost  transaction based accounts 
the corporation s checking account marketing program champ continues to attract new customers and deposits 
in addition  during the first quarter of the corporation introduced a new money market account called performance plus 
these programs are designed to develop new customer relationships  shift the corporation s funding mix towards lower cost funding sources and generate additional fee income opportunities 
the asset sensitive nature of the corporation s balance sheet should improve the net interest margin resulting in more interest income 
however  competitive pricing pressure on both sides of the balance sheet may mitigate the asset sensitive nature of the corporation s balance sheet resulting in a relatively flat margin 
in addition  a flattening of the yield curve may result in additional pressure on the net interest margin 
thus the increase in net interest income may come from the final component  an increase in earning assets and in particular loans 
loan growth is a major focus of the corporation 
the lending environment continues to be highly competitive 
however  the loan portfolio has shown steady growth during in home equity  mortgage  commercial real estate  and consumer loans 
management believes the corporation is positioned for future loan growth due to an improving market for commercial loans  an increased number of commercial lenders and an increased focus on small business loans 
maintaining sound asset quality is another major focus for the corporation 
as a result of this focus and the initiatives taken in and in the first quarter of  the corporation s asset quality ratios have improved significantly and remain strong 
during the second quarter of  the corporation sold million in nonaccruing and accruing higher risk loans the loan sale to improve the asset quality of the loan portfolio by containing the financial risk of these loans 
additionally  the corporation sold its million credit card portfolio in the first quarter of similarly  in the first quarter of  million in nonaccruing and accruing higher risk mortgage loans were sold 
these activities have had a positive impact on earnings by reducing the credit risk profile of the corporation and eliminating significant future collection costs 
nevertheless  the business of lending to commercial and consumer customers carries with it significant credit risk  which must be continually managed 
management monitors asset quality and credit risk on an ongoing basis 
the corporation is also focused on retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
the corporation s primary methods of competition are to provide exceptional customer service and to proactively market its products 
the corporation uses a quarterly independent survey of customers to review its level of customer service 
during the fourth quarter of  percent of the customers surveyed reported that they were very satisfied with the service at first charter  compared to the industry average of percent 
the corporation s main strategy for obtaining new customers is champ  a disciplined  proactive approach to attracting new accounts and customers 
its success has provided the corporation with opportunities to develop new customer relationships  to generate additional fee income and to shift its funding mix towards lower cost funding sources 
to meet the convenience needs of existing and potential customers  the corporation has recently replaced five existing branches  opened one new branch  introduced extended hours in select branches and its call center and added bilingual personnel 
the corporation will continue to update existing branches and expand into new areas as both market and economic conditions warrant 
another focus for the corporation is growing fee income through other lines of business 
these sources of income provide stability to the corporation s earnings with minimal credit risk and less exposure to interest rate risk than its community bank s traditional lines of business 
in addressing this area of focus  the corporation  through a subsidiary of fcb  acquired an insurance agency during each of the third and fourth quarters of and the fourth quarter of these acquisitions expanded the reach of the corporation s insurance services with businesses and individuals throughout the charlotte metro region 
in addition  the corporation  through a subsidiary of fcb  acquired a third party benefits administrator during the third quarter of this acquisition added new customers  expanded the corporation s product line and improved its technology platform 
also  during and early  first charter brokerage services  inc increased its number of licensed sales associates 
as a result of these actions and the continued success of champ  income from service charges  financial management services  brokerage services and insurance services increased in the corporation continuously reviews other opportunities for new products  new services and expansion as conditions warrant 
the corporation competes against other banks  savings and loan associations  savings banks  credit unions  finance companies and major retail stores that offer competing financial services 
several larger competitors have greater resources  broader geographic coverage and higher lending limits than the corporation 
however  the corporation has the fourth largest deposit market share in the charlotte metro region  which allows the corporation to compete against both larger and smaller financial institutions

financial summary for the year ended december   net interest income increased million  or percent  to million from the year ended december  due to the strong loan growth  a decrease in prepayment speeds in the securities available for sale portfolio  the refinancing of fixed term advances in and certain asset liability management transactions entered into during for the year ended december   noninterest income decreased million  or percent  to million primarily due to lower gains on the sale of securities  lower trading gains and a gain recognized on the sale of the credit card portfolio during  which did not recur in however  the corporation s primary noninterest income lines of business continued to generate strong revenue growth compared to  with financial management income up percent  insurance services income up percent and service charges up percent 
noninterest expense decreased million  or percent  to million primarily due to million of prepayment costs associated with refinancing million in fixed term advances in which did not recur in in addition  professional service fees decreased million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to additional personnel  including the acquisition of a third party benefits administrator and three insurance agencies  increased incentive compensation and employee benefit accruals resulting from an increase in earnings 
income tax expense increased million to million due to an increase in taxable income relative to nontaxable adjustments and an increase in accrued taxes resulting from a proposed tax assessment received in the third quarter of the corporation is appealing this assessment

net interest income increased million to million compared to the fourth quarter of the increase was due to a million increase in interest income primarily resulting from strong loan growth and an increase in interest rates 
the increase in interest income was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense due to an increase in interest rates and higher levels of deposits and other borrowings 
the effect of the increase in rates was partially mitigated by the refinancing of million of fixed term advances in the fourth quarter of and by certain asset liability management transactions entered into during during the fourth quarter of  noninterest income increased million to million  compared to the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily due to the following a million increase in service charges  an million increase in other noninterest income due to growth in atm  debit card and other miscellaneous fees and a million increase in insurance service income primarily due to increases in contingency income 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in brokerage income  and a million decrease in gains on sale of securities

critical accounting estimates and policies the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note one of the consolidated financial statements and are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of the corporation s accounting policies require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  certain accounting principles require significant judgment in applying the complex accounting principles to complicated transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental estimates and complex accounting principles 
in many cases  there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of estimating values of assets or liabilities 
where alternatives exist  the corporation has used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs for the valuation 
actual performance that differs from the corporation s estimates of the key variables could impact net income 
allowance for loan losses the corporation considers its policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be one of its most critical accounting policies  as it requires management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the corporation believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect its careful evaluation of credit risk considering all information available to us 
the determination of the level of the allowance and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  rests upon various judgments and assumptions  including i general economic conditions  ii loan portfolio composition  iii prior loan loss experience  iv management s evaluation of credit risk related to both individual borrowers and pools of loans and v observations derived from the corporation s ongoing internal audit and examination processes and those of its regulators 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation employs a variety of statistical modeling and estimation tools in developing the appropriate allowance 
the following provides a description of each of the components involved in the allowance for loan losses  the techniques the corporation used and the estimates and judgments inherent to each component 
the first component of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation allowance for impaired and certain classified loans  is computed based on documented reviews performed by the corporation s credit risk management 
the reviews are completed for impaired commercial relationships greater than  and classified relationships greater than  credit risk management typically estimates these valuation allowances by considering the fair value of the underlying collateral for each impaired loan using current appraisals or estimates of values 
the results of these estimates are updated quarterly or periodically as circumstances change 
changes in the dollar amount of impaired loans or in the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral can impact the valuation allowance on impaired loans and  therefore  the overall allowance for loan losses 
the second component of the allowance for loan losses  the portion attributable to all other loans without specific reserve amounts  is determined by applying historical loss rates to the outstanding balance of loans 
the portfolio is segmented into two major categories commercial loans and consumer loans  which include mortgage  general consumer  consumer real estate  home equity and consumer unsecured loans 
commercial loans are segmented further by risk grade  so that separate loss factors are applied to each pool of commercial loans 
the historical loss factors applied to the commercial segments are determined using a migration analysis tool that computes current loss estimates by credit grade using a trailing loss history database 
since the migration analysis is based on trailing data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses 
changes in commercial loan credit grades or in the mix of the portfolio can also impact this component of the allowance for loan losses from period to period 
consumer loans are segmented further by collateral types in order to apply separate loss factors to each pool of consumer loans 
the historical loss factors applied to the consumer segments are a twelve month rolling average of losses 
since the loss factors are based on historical data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses 
the third component of the allowance for loan losses is intended to capture the various risk elements of the loan portfolio which may not be sufficiently captured in the historical loss rates 
these factors currently include intrinsic risk  operational risk and concentration risk 
intrinsic risk relates to the impact of current economic conditions on the corporation s borrower base  the effects of which may not be realized by the corporation in the form of charge offs for several periods 
the corporation monitors and documents various local  regional and national economic data  and makes subjective estimates of the impact of changes in economic conditions on the allowance for loan losses 
operational risk includes factors such as the likelihood of loss on a loan due to procedural error 
historically  the corporation has made additional loss estimates for certain types of loans that were either acquired from other institutions in mergers or were underwritten using policies that are no longer in effect at the corporation 
these identified loans are considered to have higher risk of loss than currently reflected in historical loss rates of the corporation  so additional estimates of loss are made by management 
concentration risk includes the risk of loss due to extensions of credit to a particular industry  loan type or borrower that may be troubled 
the corporation monitors its portfolio for any excessive concentrations of loans during each period  and if any excessive concentrations are noted  additional estimates of loss would be made 
changes in the allowance for loan losses for these subjective factors can arise from changes in the balance and types of outstanding loans  as well as changes in the underlying conditions which drive a change in the percentage used 
as more fully discussed below  the corporation continually monitors the portfolio in an effort to identify any other factors which may have an impact on loss estimates within the portfolio 
all estimates of the loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to continued risk that the real estate market and economic conditions in general could continue to change and therefore result in additional losses and require increases in the provision for loan losses 
if management had made different assumptions about probable loan losses  the corporation s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
for additional discussion concerning the corporation s allowance for loan losses and related matters  see allowance for loan losses 
tax contingencies in accounting for tax contingencies  the corporation assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the corporation s tax position 
for those matters where it is probable that the corporation will have to pay additional taxes  interest or penalties and a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  the corporation has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements 
changes to the corporation s tax contingency estimate occur periodically due to implementation of new tax planning strategies  resolution with taxing authorities of issues with previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
these changes  which are often driven by the corporation s judgments  affect current taxes payable and can be material to the corporation s operating results for any particular period 
derivative instruments the corporation enters into interest rate swap agreements as business conditions warrant 
these interest rate swap agreements provide an exchange of interest payments computed on notional amounts that will offset any undesirable change in fair value resulting from market rate changes on designated hedged items 
a swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts  assets and or indices 
the interest rate swap agreements utilized by the corporation qualify for hedge accounting as fair value hedges 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined by a third party at inception and is valued subsequently on a quarterly basis 
the valuation is determined using a discounted cash flow model and a volatility index 
the corporation performs a quarterly assessment based on the third party valuations to assess whether the derivative used in its hedging transaction has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
the effectiveness assessment is conducted using the cumulative dollar offset method 
the corporation accounts for these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the fair value of the designated federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
currently  three of the corporation s seven interest rate swaps meet the criteria for the short cut accounting method 
according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 the short cut method assumes that the change in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged debt obligation is one hundred percent correlated  which results in no ineffectiveness and no income statement effect 
for interest rate swaps that do not meet the criteria for the short cut accounting method  the corporation records on a quarterly basis  in noninterest income  the net change in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the designated fhlb advances  attributed to changes in interest rates  provided the criteria for hedge accounting continue to be met 
in the event the criteria for hedge accounting are not met in a future period  the corporation will cease recording the change in fair value of the fhlb advances and will amortize into earnings the then carrying value of the interest rate swap over the life of the hedged item 
the derivative hedging instruments are recorded at fair value in other assets or other liabilities 
the corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
this documentation includes analysis at inception and is ongoing relative to the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
if the corporation s initial judgments were inappropriate  hedge accounting would be reversed and only the change in fair value of the derivative would be recognized through the income statement 
the corporation will discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge  and will reflect changes in fair value through the income statement 
see asset liability management and interest rate risk for further details regarding these interest rate swap agreements 
earnings performance net interest income and margin net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
an analysis of the corporation s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and average balance sheets for the last three years is presented in table two 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis fte is a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles performance measure used by management in operating the business which management believes provides investors with a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
the changes in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis from year to year are analyzed in table three 
the discussion below is based on net interest income computed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for the year ended december   net interest income amounted to million  an increase of approximately percent from net interest income of million in this increase was primarily due to a million or percent increase in interest income due mainly to strong loan growth  increases in the securities available for sale portfolio and a decrease in prepayment speeds in the securities available for sale portfolio 
in addition  net interest income was impacted by a million or percent decrease in interest expense compared to this decrease was primarily due to the following a shift in funding sources from higher cost retail cds to lower cost transaction based accounts  the repricing of retail cds at lower rates in and  the refinancing of million of fixed term advances in and certain asset liability management transactions entered into during these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest rates 
the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets increased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in due to the asset sensitive nature of the balance sheet 
the effective yield on earning assets during was negatively impacted by earning assets that repriced at lower interest rates during and the first half of rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points primarily due to the previously mentioned deposit mix shift  refinancings and the corporation s asset liability management alm transactions 
this was partially offset by the basis point increase in the fed funds rate 
the primary objective of the corporation in interest rate risk management is to maximize the net interest margin across a broad range of interest rate scenarios  while maintaining an appropriate interest rate risk profile 
average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the year ended december  compared to billion for the same period 
these increases were primarily due to growth in the corporation s average loans and loans held for sale portfolio  which increased million during  compared to the same period 
these increases were mainly due to growth in the home equity  mortgage  consumer and commercial real estate loan categories 
the increases in average loans and loans held for sale were partially offset by mortgage loan securitizations of million and the sale of million of nonaccruing and accruing higher risk mortgage loans in average interest earning assets were also impacted by increases in the corporation s securities available for sale portfolio of million during  compared to in addition to the increase in average interest earning assets  the corporation experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
average other borrowings increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period and were used to fund loan growth and securities purchases 
in addition  average deposits increased million from the year ended december  while certificates of deposits declined on average million for the year ended december   noninterest bearing and other core deposit categories increased million  primarily due to the continued success of champ

noninterest income the major components of noninterest income are derived from service charges on deposit accounts as well as other banking products and services from the corporation s various lines of business including brokerage  mortgage  insurance and financial management 
in addition  the corporation realizes gains from the sale of bond and equity securities and income from its investment in bank owned life insurance boli 
noninterest income decreased million  or percent  to million compared to the same period in a number of factors contributed to the decrease 
gains on the sale of securities totaling million were recognized in  compared to gains of million in  representing a decrease of million 
in  additional gains of million from the sale of the first charter credit card portfolio and million of trading gains were recognized 
in addition  mortgage loan fees decreased million as origination volume declined and the bank retained a larger portion of mortgage loans 
these decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by the following a million increase in service charges primarily due to growth in checking accounts  a million increase in financial management income primarily due to the acquisition of a third party benefits administrator in the third quarter of  and a million increase in other noninterest income due to growth in atm and debit card fees  property sale gains of million and a gain of million recognized on the sale of deposits and loans 
in addition  insurance services income increased million 
the increase in insurance services income was partially due to a full year impact of the successful integration of two insurance agencies acquired in and a partial year impact for the acquisition of one insurance agency acquired in the fourth quarter of in addition  insurance services income was impacted by a million increase in contingency income  as the corporation was able to guarantee a higher amount of contingency income compared to contingency income is subject to fluctuations based on events beyond the corporation s control

the increase was primarily due to the following i a million decrease in the provision for loan losses primarily attributable to the loan sale  ii an million decrease in noninterest expense due to million of prepayment costs associated with refinancing million in fixed term advances in the  iii an million increase in interest income due mainly to strong loan growth  increases in the securities available for sale portfolio and a decrease in prepayment speeds in the securities available for sale portfolio  and iv a million decrease in interest expense due to the previously mentioned deposit mix shift  refinancings and alm transactions 
these items were partially offset by i an million increase in income tax expense due to an increase in taxable income relative to nontaxable adjustments and an increase in accrued taxes resulting from a proposed tax assessment received in the third quarter of and ii a million decrease in noninterest income primarily resulting from a decrease in gains on the sale of securities  the recognition of the gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio in the first quarter of and lower trading gains 
other operating segments reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same year ago period 
noninterest income increased million due to the following increases in insurance services revenues resulting from an increase in contingency income and the successful integration of two insurance agencies acquired in and one insurance agency acquired in the fourth quarter of and financial management income primarily due to the acquisition of a third party benefits administrator in  partially offset by decreased mortgage services income 
the increase in noninterest income was partially offset by increased noninterest expense of million resulting from an increase in salaries and employee benefits due to additional personnel  including the acquisition of a third party benefits administrator and three insurance agencies 
other reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the same year ago period 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher noninterest income of million resulting from gains on the sale of equity securities during  which was partially offset by increased income tax expense 
balance sheet analysis securities available for sale the securities portfolio  all of which is classified as available for sale  is a component of the corporation s alm strategy 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  and other factors 
securities available for sale are accounted for at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the fair value of the securities portfolio is determined by a third party 
the valuation is determined as of a date within close proximity to the end of the reporting period based on available quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar securities if a quoted market price is not available 
at december   securities available for sale were billion or percent of total assets  compared to billion or percent of total assets at december  the increase in the securities available for sale portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of agency securities funded by the proceeds from the sale of million of primarily fixed rate mortgage loans that were moved to securities available for sale securitized during the securities available for sale portfolio also was impacted by an increase in the pre tax unrealized net losses in the portfolio due to a rise in short and intermediate term interest rates 
pre tax unrealized net losses on securities available for sale were million at december  compared to pre tax unrealized net gains of million at december  proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale were million and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross gains of million and gross losses of million were realized in  compared to gross gains of million and gross losses of million realized in the weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  with market indicators predicting a continued rise in interest rates  the unrealized net losses in the securities available for sale portfolio could increase 
however  it is anticipated that the effective yields in the portfolio would increase as the amortization of premiums decreases due to slowing prepayment speeds 
to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on the securities available for sale portfolio  the corporation has maintained a shortened average life in the portfolio over the past two years 
this will allow the corporation to reinvest the cash flows of the portfolio into higher rate securities or fund loan growth in a rising interest rate environment 
management is evaluating the purchase of up to million of whole arm mortgage loans in the seconday market during  which will be funded by the sales and cash flows from the securities available for sale portfolio 
this will reduce the size of the securities available for sale portfolio  and will result in an investment in earning assets with similar average lives and higher yields 
the following table shows  as of december    and  the carrying value of i us government obligations  ii us government agency obligations  iii mortgage backed securities  iv state and municipal obligations  and v equity securities  which are primarily comprised of federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock

loans held for sale increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  during  million of residential mortgage loans were securitized and subsequently sold 
loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december  consisted of six major categories commercial non real estate  commercial real estate  construction  mortgage  consumer  and home equity 
within these six segments the corporation targets customers in its geographic area  works within most business segments and focuses on a relationship based business model 
pricing is driven by quality  loan size  the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition 
the corporation is primarily a secured lender in all these loan categories 
the corporation s loans are generally five years or less in duration with the exception of home equity lines and residential mortgages  for which the terms range from to years 
in addition  the corporation has a program in which it buys and sells portions of loans primarily originated in the southeastern region of the united states  both participations and syndications  from key strategic partner financial institutions with which the corporation has established relationships 
current balances of loans purchased and sold through the strategic partners program were million and million  respectively  at december  this portfolio includes commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans 
this program enables the corporation to diversify both its geographic and its total exposure risk 
commercial non real estate the corporation s commercial non real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market businesses with sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
commercial lending includes commercial  financial  agricultural and industrial loans 
pricing on commercial non real estate loans  driven largely by the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition  is usually tied to widely recognized market indexes  such as the prime rate  the london interbank offer rate libor or rates on us treasury securities 
commercial real estate similar to commercial non real estate lending  the corporation s commercial real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market business with sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
the real estate loans are both owner occupied and project related 
as with commercial non real estate loans  pricing on commercial real estate loans  driven largely by the corporation s relationship with the customer and by competition  is usually tied to widely recognized market indexes  such as the prime rate  libor or rates on us treasury securities 
construction real estate construction loans include both commercial and residential construction permanent loans  which are intended to convert to permanent loans upon completion of the construction project 
loans for commercial construction are usually to in market developers  builders  businesses  individuals or real estate investors for the construction of commercial structures primarily in the corporation s market area 
from time to time  the corporation purchases construction loans in other market areas through a correspondent relationship 
at december   loans purchased through this relationship represented percent of the total construction loan portfolio 
construction loans purchased are typically serviced by third parties 
loans are made for purposes including  but not limited to  the construction of industrial facilities  apartments  shopping centers  office buildings  homes and warehouses 
the properties may be constructed for sale  lease or owner occupancy 
mortgage the corporation originates family residential mortgage loans throughout the corporation s footprint and in reston  virginia  which is a loan origination office 
the corporation offers a full line of products  including conventional  conforming  and jumbo fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages which are originated and securitized or sold into the secondary market  however  from time to time a portion of this production is retained and serviced through a third party arrangement 
consumer the corporation offers a wide variety of consumer loan products 
various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying existing customers and to other creditworthy candidates in the corporation s market area 
unsecured loans  including revolving credits eg checking account overdraft protection and personal lines of credit are provided and various installment loan products such as vehicle loans are offered 
all consumer lending is centrally decisioned and documented 
home equity home equity loans and lines are secured by first and second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
as with all consumer lending  home equity loans are centrally decisioned and documented to ensure the underwriting conforms to the corporate lending policy 
gross loans increased million  or percent  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the growth in loans was primarily due to i a million increase in home equity loans partially due to the corporation s direct mailing campaign  ii a million increase in primarily adjustable rate mortgage loans  iii a million increase in commercial real estate loans and iv a million increase in consumer loans 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in construction loans 
in addition  million of nonaccruing and accruing higher risk residential mortgage loans were sold to investors during the first quarter of and million of primarily fixed rate mortgage loans originated in were classified as held for sale  securitized and subsequently sold 
the mix of variable rate  adjustable rate and fixed rate loans is incorporated in the corporation s alm strategy 
as of december   of the billion loan portfolio  approximately billion was tied to variable interest rates  most of which reprice within one day of any interest rate change  approximately billion was tied to fixed interest rates with scheduled maturities and billion was tied to adjustable interest rates  which are arm loans and reprice on a fixed schedule

this program is designed to develop new customer relationships  shift the corporation s funding mix towards lower cost funding sources and generate additional fee income opportunities 
total deposits increased million  or percent  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase in deposits was due to a million increase in cds resulting primarily from a promotional campaign launched in november 
in addition  low cost interest checking  savings and noninterest bearing deposits increased million and money market accounts increased million 
table two provides information on the average deposit balances for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other borrowings other borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  fhlb borrowings and other miscellaneous borrowings 
federal funds purchased represent unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions by the bank 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent short term borrowings by the bank with maturities less than one year collateralized by a portion of the corporation s securities investment portfolio of the united states government or its agencies 
these borrowings are an important source of funding to the corporation 
access to alternate short term funding sources allows the corporation to meet funding needs without relying on increasing deposits on a short term basis 
fhlb borrowings are collateralized by securities from the corporation s investment portfolio and a blanket lien on certain qualifying commercial and single family loans held in the corporation s loan portfolio 
fhlb borrowings are an alternative to other funding sources with similar maturities 
other borrowings increased slightly during the year  to billion at december   from billion at december  deposit growth was the primary funding source for the growth in earning assets 
the following is a schedule of other borrowings which consists of the following categories securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and fhlb borrowings for the years ended december   and table ten other borrowings december  december  december  dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase balance as of average balance maximum outstanding at any month end fhlb borrowings balance as of average balance maximum outstanding at any month end other borrowings balance as of average balance maximum outstanding at any month end total balance as of average balance maximum outstanding at any month end credit risk management the corporation s credit risk policy and procedures are centralized for every loan type 
in addition  all mortgage  consumer and home equity loans are centrally decisioned 
all loans flow through an independent closing unit to ensure proper documentation 
finally  all known collection or problem loans are centrally managed by experienced workout personnel 
to monitor the effectiveness of policies and procedures  management maintains a set of asset quality standards for past due  nonaccrual and watch list loans and monitors the trends of these standards over time 
these standards are approved by the board of directors and reviewed quarterly with the board of directors for compliance 
loan administration and underwriting the bank s chief risk officer is responsible for the continuous assessment of the bank s risk profile as well as making any necessary adjustments to policies and procedures 
commercial loan relationships less than  may be approved by experienced commercial loan officers  within their loan authority 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are approved by signature authority requiring at least two experienced officers for relationships greater than  the exceptions to this would include city executives senior loan officers who are authorized to approve relationships up to million and the bank s strategic partners division  whose manager has million of loan authority for such relationships 
an independent risk manager is involved in the approval of commercial and commercial real estate relationships that exceed million and strategic partner relationships that exceed million 
all relationships greater than million receive a comprehensive annual review by either the senior credit analysts or lending officers of the bank  which is then reviewed by the independent risk managers and or the final approval officer with the appropriate signature authority 
commitments over million are further reviewed by senior lending officers of the bank  the chief risk officer and the lending oversight committee comprised of executive and senior management 
in addition  commitments over million are reviewed by the board of directors loan committee 
these oversight committees provide policy  process  product and specific relationship direction to the lending personnel 
the corporation has a general target lending limit of million per relationship  however  at times some loan relationships may exceed that limit 
as of december   the corporation had relationships with exposure greater than the million lending limit 
at december   the total loan balance of these relationships was million  all of which were current  with unfunded commitments totaling million 
the corporation s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the corporation s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the corporation s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the corporation s credit policies and procedures 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity are deemed less risky than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  as the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
consumer loans  being smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the corporation s entire primary market area  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the corporation s least risky loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans as home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decisioning process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
this process is detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
the corporation s primary market area includes the state of north carolina but predominately centers around the metro region of charlotte 
at december   the majority of the total loan portfolio  as well as a substantial portion of the commercial and real estate loan portfolio  represents loans to borrowers within this metro region 
an economic downturn in the corporation s primary market area could adversely affect its business 
the diversity of the region s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment 
no significant concentration of credit risk has been identified due to the diverse industrial base in the region 
derivatives credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost should the counter parties with contracts in a gain position to the corporation completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral 
in managing derivative credit risk  both the current exposure  which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date  as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered 
in managing credit risk associated with its derivative activities  the corporation deals primarily with commercial banks  broker dealers and corporations 
to minimize credit risk  the corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements  which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter party upon the occurrence of certain events 
in addition  the corporation reduces risk by obtaining collateral based on individual assessments of the counter parties to these agreements 
the determination of the need for and levels of collateral will vary depending on the credit risk rating of the counter party 
during  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to provide an exchange of interest payments computed on notional amounts that will offset any undesirable change in fair value resulting from market rate changes on designated hedged items 
see asset liability management and interest rate risk for further details regarding these interest rate swap agreements 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
the nonaccrual status is determined after a loan is days past due as to principal or interest  unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
oreo represents real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof and is generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
nonaccrual loans at december  decreased to million compared to million at december  the decrease includes the sale of million of nonaccrual mortgage loans during the first quarter of oreo decreased to million at december  from million at december  as a result of the corporation s continued focus on asset quality  the initiatives taken in and in and generally improving economic conditions  asset quality remains strong 
the table below summarizes the corporation s nonperforming assets and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest as of the dates indicated 
table eleven nonperforming and problem assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans other real estate total nonperforming assets loans days or more past due and still accruing interest total nonperforming assets and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets loans and other real estate ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans x x x x x nonaccrual loans at december  were not concentrated in any one industry and primarily consisted of several large credits secured by real estate 
management anticipates that nonaccrual loans may increase in the near term as some customers continue to experience difficulties in this current economic environment 
management has taken current economic conditions into consideration when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses for a more detailed discussion 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest is based on a review of each loan 
generally  accrual of interest is discontinued on loans days past due as to principal or interest unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
management s policy for any accruing loan greater than days past due is to perform an analysis of the loan  including a consideration of the financial position of the borrower and any guarantor as well as the value of the collateral  and use this information to make an assessment as to whether collectibility of the principal and interest appears probable 
if such collectibility is not probable  the loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when management determines  based on an evaluation of the underlying collateral together with the borrower s payment record and financial condition  that the borrower has the ability and intent to meet the contractual obligations of the loan agreement 
allowance for loan losses the corporation s allowance for loan losses consists of four components i valuation allowances computed on impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 ii valuation allowance for certain classified loans  iii valuation allowances determined by applying historical loss rates to those loans not specifically identified as impaired  and iv valuation allowances for factors which management believes are not reflected in the historical loss rates or that otherwise need to be considered when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
these four components are estimated quarterly by credit risk management and  along with a narrative analysis  comprise the corporation s allowance for loan losses model 
the resulting components are used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
all estimates of loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to risk in the real estate market and changes in the economic conditions in its primary market area 
changes in these areas can increase or decrease the provision for loan losses 
during  the corporation made no changes to its estimated loss percentages for economic factors 
as a part of its quarterly assessment of the allowance for loan losses  the corporation reviews key local  regional and national economic information and assesses its impact on the allowance for loan losses 
based on its review for the year ended december   the corporation noted that economic conditions are mixed  however  management concluded that the impact on borrowers and local industries in the corporation s primary market area did not change significantly during the period 
accordingly  the corporation did not modify its loss estimate percentage attributable to economic factors in its allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation continuously reviews its portfolio for any concentrations of loans to any one borrower or industry 
to analyze its concentrations  the corporation prepares various reports showing total loans to borrowers by industry  as well as reports showing total loans to one borrower 
at the present time  the corporation does not believe it is overly concentrated to any industry or specific borrower and therefore has made no allocations of allowances for loan losses for this factor for any of the periods presented 
the corporation also monitors the amount of operational risk that exists in the portfolio 
this would include the front end underwriting  documentation and closing processes associated with the lending decision 
the percent of additional allocation for the operational reserve has not changed in recent periods

this type of secured lending generally carries lower credit risk and thus requires lower allocations in the corporation s allowance model 
in addition  the allowance for loan losses was reduced by million due to the sale of nonaccruing and accruing higher risk mortgage loans and by net charge offs of million 
net charge offs benefited from one million commercial loan recovery during the second quarter of and by the recovery of million from the sale of previously charged off consumer loans during the third quarter 
these reductions were offset by an additional provision expense of million for the year ended december  the following table presents the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses applicable to major loan categories and the percentage of the loans in each category to total loans as of december     and table fourteen allocation of the allowance for loan losses december  loan loan loan loan loan dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans commercial real estate commercial non real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity total the allowance amounts assigned to each category of loans represent the historical loss experience of the loans adjusted for current economic events or conditions 
total commercial loan allocations of allowance for loan losses increased approximately million in commercial allowance allocations were affected by commercial loan growth  which was partially offset by lower historical loss factors as asset quality trends improved 
as the asset quality in the commercial loan portfolio improves  the historical loss factors continue to decrease 
management anticipates these historical loss factors will trend lower over time  as the allowance model will be impacted by lower historical losses 
allocations of allowance for loan losses for consumer loans increased approximately million in over due to consumer loan growth and higher historical loss factors for unsecured consumer loans 
mortgage loans allocation of allowance for loan losses increased approximately million in over primarily due to mortgage loan growth  partially offset by the sale of nonaccruing and accruing higher risk mortgage loans 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover inherent losses in the bank s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
management believes it has established the allowance in consideration of the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to earnings which is necessary to maintain an adequate and appropriate allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the factors which influence changes in the allowance for loan losses have a direct effect on the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses changes from period to period as a result of a number of factors  the most significant of which for the corporation include the following i changes in the mix of types of loans  ii current charge offs and recoveries of loans  iii changes in impaired loan valuation allowances  iv changes in valuations in certain performing loans which have specific allocations  v changes in credit grades within the portfolio  which arise from a deterioration or an improvement in the performance of the borrower  vi changes in historical loss percentages  and vii changes in the amounts of loans outstanding  which are used to estimate current probable loan losses 
in addition  the corporation considers other  more subjective factors which impact the credit quality of the portfolio as a whole and estimates allocations of allowance for loan losses for these factors  as well 
these factors include loan concentrations  economic conditions and operational risks 
changes in these components of the allowance can arise from fluctuations in the underlying percentages used as related loss estimates for these factors  as well as variations in the portfolio balances to which they are applied 
the net change in all of these components of the allowance for loan losses results in the provision for loan losses 
for a more detailed discussion of the corporation s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million a year ago 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to the loan sale and improved asset quality trends 
in addition  certain residential rental property loans totaling million identified in the third quarter of resulted in the corporation increasing the provision for loan losses by approximately million during that period 
the provision for loan losses was also impacted by a decrease in net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to the same year ago period 
net charge offs for the year ended december  amounted to million  or percent of average loans  compared to million  or percent of average loans for the same period 
net charge offs benefited from a million commercial loan recovery during the second quarter of and a third quarter recovery of million from the sale of previously charged off loans 
market risk management asset liability management and interest rate risk the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management strategy is to enhance earnings through balance sheet growth while reducing or minimizing the risk caused by interest rate changes 
one method used to manage interest rate sensitivity is to measure  over various time periods  the interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  however  this method addresses only the magnitude of timing differences and does not address earnings or market value 
management uses an earnings simulation model to assess the amount of earnings at risk due to changes in interest rates 
management believes this method more accurately measures interest rate risk 
this model is updated monthly and is based on a range of interest rate shock scenarios 
under the corporation s policy  the limit for interest rate risk is percent of net interest income when considering an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points over a twelve month period 
assuming a basis point pro rata increase in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would positively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  assuming a basis point pro rata decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would negatively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  although the corporation s policy for interest shock scenarios is an increase or decrease of basis points  in the current low interest rate environment rate it believes a basis point decline in rates is more appropriate 
both of the rate shock scenarios are within management s acceptable range 
the corporation also completes instantaneous parallel interest rate shocks 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on january   the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would positively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  assuming a basis point decrease in interest rates at january   the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate risk would negatively impact net interest income by approximately percent of net interest income at december  during  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps resulted in the corporation receiving interest at an average fixed rate of percent and paying interest at an average variable rate of percent  which is based off libor  for an average period of years with a notional amount of million 
as a result of swapping million of fixed rate debt payments for variable rate payments  the corporation s balance sheet would become liability sensitive 
therefore  as part of the corporation s alm strategy of preserving the asset sensitive nature of the corporation s balance sheet  the corporation replaced million of existing fhlb floating rate overnight borrowings with fixed rate fhlb advances with maturities of one to three years 
interest rate swaps assist the corporation s alm process 
the corporation s interest rate risk management strategy includes the use of interest rate contracts to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
the corporation s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have significant adverse effects on net interest income 
as a result of interest rate fluctuations  hedged fixed rate liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value 
gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed rate liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
interest rate contracts  which are non leveraged interest rate swaps  allow the corporation to effectively manage its interest rate risk position 
non leveraged interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amount 
exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as interest rates fluctuate 
refer to notes one and seven of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the corporation s use of written over the counter covered call options 
table fifteen summarizes the expected maturities and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with certain of the corporation s significant non trading financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits are excluded from table fifteen as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the corporation 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
standby letters of credit are recorded as a liability by the corporation at the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
commitments to extend credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the corporation until the instrument is exercised 
refer to note seventeen of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of commitments
