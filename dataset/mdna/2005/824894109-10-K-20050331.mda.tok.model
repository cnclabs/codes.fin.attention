overview shoe pavilion is an independent off price footwear retailer on the west coast that offers a broad selection of women s  men s and children s designer label and name brand merchandise 
the company operated retail stores in california  washington  oregon and arizona under the trade name shoe pavilion as of january  and retail stores as of january  the company also operates an internet store for online purchases of footwear 
in july  the company entered into a licensing agreement to operate the shoe departments of gordmans  inc formerly richman gordman price stores  inc department stores located in the midwest 
the license agreement expired in june at which time the company discontinued operating all of the licensed shoe departments in gordmans department stores 
shoe pavilion opened six retail stores and closed five in in the company opened four retail stores and closed seven and in the company opened stores and closed five 
the company closed licensed shoe departments in  including two it had opened in during  the company intends to open nine to twelve new stores  primarily in california  arizona and nevada 
the company expects that the primary source of future sales growth will be new store openings and to a lesser extent from an improvement in comparable store sales 
although comparable store sales have fluctuated the past several years  the company believes it can achieve an improvement in comparable store sales by focusing on refining its sales efforts  including merchandise selection  advertising and promotions 
in late the company expanded its product line to include children s shoes and handbags 
in the company expanded its product line to include athletic accessories 
the addition of these categories contributed to the increase in comparable store sales in the company defines comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store net sales increased in and decreased in and in net sales in and were negatively impacted because as of june the company no longer operated the licensed shoe departments 
net sales generated from the licensed shoe departments were million for the year ended december  in addition  these stores generated a store operating contribution before overhead  distribution costs  interest and taxes of approximately 
million for the year ended december  the company does not allocate overhead  distribution costs  interest or taxes to stores 
the majority of the overhead costs  which consist of costs such as merchandising  accounting  information systems  rent and insurance  are shared expenses of the shoe pavilion stores and previously the licensed shoe departments 
the company seeks to acquire footwear merchandise on favorable financing terms and in quantities large enough to support future growth 
this strategy causes an increase in inventory levels at various times throughout the year 
as a result  similar to other off price retailers  the company s inventory turnover rates are typically less than full price retailers 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the company s financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from the company s estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes that the company s application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the company s application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this form k 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market 
the company adjusts inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
the factors considered include  current sell through  seasonality and length of time held in inventory 
the amount ultimately realized from the sale of inventory could differ materially from the company s estimate 
fixed assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of fixed assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related fixed assets and reduces their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
the company believes at this time that the fixed assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued workers compensation 
in december  the company modified its workers compensation insurance policy to a high deductible insurance program with an overall program ceiling to minimize exposure 
the company began recording an estimated liability for the self insured portion of the workers compensation claims 
the liability as of january  was  and is determined based on information received from our insurance carrier including claims paid  filed and reserved for  as well as using historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the settlement costs increase beyond what was anticipated  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
income taxes 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some or a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based upon its history of earnings the company believes that the realization of its deferred tax asset is more likely than not and therefore has not provided a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset

factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this form k 
risks associated with expansion the company s continued growth will depend to a significant degree on its ability to expand its operations through the opening of new stores and to operate these stores on a profitable basis 
the success of the company s planned expansion will be significantly dependent upon the company s ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms 
in addition  several other factors could affect the company s ability to expand  including the adequacy of the company s capital resources  the ability to hire  train and integrate employees and the ability to adapt the company s operational systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that any such expansion will be profitable 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s expansion within its existing markets will not adversely affect the financial performance of the company s existing stores or its overall operating results  or that new stores will achieve net sales and profitability levels consistent with existing stores 
as part of its expansion planning the company regularly evaluates the adequacy of its existing systems and procedures  including the product distribution facility  store management  financial controls and management information systems 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will anticipate all of the changing demands that expanded operations may impose on such systems 
failure to adapt its internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company actively monitors individual store performance and has closed underperforming stores in the past 
the company intends to continue to close underperforming stores in the future  and if it were to close a number of stores  it could incur significant closing costs and reductions in net sales 
in certain instances  the company may be unable to close an underperforming store on a timely basis because of lease terms 
a significant increase in closure costs or the inability to close one or more underperforming stores on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in comparable store sales historically  the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated widely 
although the company is endeavoring to achieve consistent growth in comparable store sales  there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to experience volatility in comparable store sales

stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store sales increased in and decreased and in and  respectively 

table of contents inventory and sourcing risk the company s future success will be significantly dependent on its ability to obtain merchandise that consumers want to buy  particularly name brand merchandise with long term retail appeal  and to acquire such merchandise under favorable terms and conditions 
in  the company s top ten suppliers accounted for approximately of its inventory purchases 
the deterioration of the company s relationship with any key vendor or vendors could result in delivery delays  merchandise shortages or less favorable terms than the company currently enjoys 
the company deals with its suppliers on an order by order basis and has no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing 
as the company s operations expand  its demand for off price inventory will continue to increase 
the company s footwear purchases typically involve manufacturing over runs  over orders  mid or late season deliveries or last season s stock 
the inability of the company to obtain a sufficient supply of readily salable  high margin inventory  to negotiate favorable discount and payment agreements with its suppliers or to sell large inventory purchases without markdowns could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business sourcing and purchasing 
reliance on key personnel the company s future success will be dependent  to a significant extent  on the efforts and abilities of its executive officers 
the loss of the services of any one of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s continued growth will depend  in part  on its ability to attract  motivate and retain skilled managerial and merchandising personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain a substantial percentage of its existing personnel or attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and net income 
historically  net sales and net income have been weakest during the first quarter 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including timing of new store openings  the level of net sales contributed by new stores  merchandise mix  the timing and level of price markdowns  availability of inventory  store closures  advertising costs  the success of advertising campaigns competitive pressures and changes in the demand for off price footwear 
dependence on consumer spending and preferences the success of the company s operations depends upon a number of general economic factors relating to consumer spending  including employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  inflation and taxation 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not decline in response to economic conditions  thereby adversely affecting the company s operating results 
all of the company s products are subject to changing consumer preferences 
consumer preferences could shift to types of footwear other than those that the company currently offers 
any such shift could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s future success will depend  in part  on its ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively anticipate or respond to such changes on a timely basis or at all 
failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to  among other things  lower net sales  excess inventory and lower gross margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company has one distribution center most of the inventory purchased by the company is shipped directly from suppliers to a single centralized distribution center in chino  california  where the inventory is then processed  sorted and shipped to the company s stores 
because a substantial portion of the inventory first goes through the chino distribution center  any disruption at this site could negatively impact the company s receiving and distribution process 
although the company maintains business interruption and property insurance there can be no assurance that the insurance would be sufficient or that any insurance proceeds would be timely paid out to the company 
international purchasing the company purchases in season name brand and branded design merchandise directly from factories in italy and china 
the company has no long term contracts with direct manufacturing sources and competes with other companies for production facilities 
all of the manufacturers with which the company conducts business are located outside of the united states  and the company is subject to the risks generally associated with an import business  including foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements  disruptions or delays in shipments and the risks associated with united states import laws and regulations  including quotas  duties  taxes  tariffs and other restrictions

see item business sourcing and purchasing 
inventory shrinkage the retail industry is subject to theft by customers and employees 
because the company uses a self service format  where shoppers have access to both shoes of a pair  the company must maintain substantial store security 
although the company has implemented enhanced security procedures  there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer from significant inventory shrinkage in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the retail footwear market is highly competitive  and the company expects the level of competition to increase 
the company competes with off price and discount retailers eg  nordstrom rack  payless shoesource  ross  dress for less and famous footwear  branded retail outlets eg  nine west  national retail stores eg  dsw shoe warehouse  nordstrom  marshalls  macy s  sears  jc penney  loehmann s  robinsons may and mervyn s  traditional shoe stores and mass merchants 
many of these competitors have stores in the markets in which the company now operates and in which it plans to expand 
many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in the future new participants will not enter the off price segment of the footwear market 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies could materially adversely affect the company s gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face greater competition from other national  regional or local retailers or that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing and new competitors 
the inability of the company to respond to such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents future capital needs the company expects that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under its credit facility will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent that the foregoing cash resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  including new store openings planned for  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to obtain such financing could delay or prevent the company s planned expansion  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial control by single stockholder dmitry beinus  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result  mr 
beinus is able to decide all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
the concentration of stock ownership could also have the effect of preventing a change in control of the company 
possible volatility of stock price the company s common stock is quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has experienced and is likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations  either of which could adversely affect the market price of the common stock without regard to the operating performance of the company 
in addition  the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  fluctuations in the company s comparable store sales  announcements by other footwear retailers  the failure of the company s earnings to meet the expectations of investors  as well as other events or factors
