item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the consolidated financial statements of griffin include the accounts of griffin s subsidiary in the landscape nursery business  imperial nurseries  inc imperial  and griffin s connecticut and massachusetts based real estate business griffin land 
prior to march   griffin had an equity investment in centaur communications  ltd 
centaur  a privately held magazine publishing business based in the united kingdom 
on march   griffin completed the sale of its investment in centaur and recorded a substantial gain 
the proceeds from that sale included cash and stock in the acquiring company  centaur holdings  plc centaur holdings 
griffin s investment in centaur holdings is accounted for as an available for sale security 
the notes to griffin s consolidated financial statements included in item contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of griffin s consolidated financial statements 
however  in the opinion of management  because of the relative magnitude of griffin s inventories and real estate assets  accounting methods and estimates related to those assets are critical to the preparation of griffin s consolidated financial statements 
in many other cases  however  griffin must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following is a review of the more significant accounting estimates and methods used by griffin investments griffin classifies its investments in debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values based upon management s intent regarding the security 
if there is a decline in fair value of available for sale securities  griffin evaluates whether such decline is other than temporary 
accounts receivable management estimates future recoverability of its accounts receivable based on an accounts aging  payment history and financial condition 
inventories in applying the principle of the lower of cost or market using the average cost method to nursery stock  management must estimate the future recoverability of certain parts of the inventory that have not matured as planned 
such estimates are based on the physical characteristics of the nursery stock in question and potential sales outlets 
deferred tax assets in applying sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  management estimates future taxable income from operations  the sale of appreciated assets and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that griffin will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
impairment of long lived assets griffin evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets in relation to their fair values  operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows 
in connection with griffin s real estate business  development costs that have been capitalized are periodically reviewed for future recoverability 
summary griffin s results in fiscal reflect a substantial pretax gain on the sale of its investment in centaur and a related gain on a foreign currency exchange contract  offset by lower operating results at griffin land and imperial and higher general corporate expense 
griffin s overall interest expense was lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and interest and dividend income was higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal the lower interest expense and higher interest and dividend income reflect a portion of the cash received from the sale of centaur being used to repay the amount outstanding under griffin s revolving credit agreement  with the balance of the cash proceeds being used for income tax payments and investments 
a detailed discussion of fiscal results is included below 
results of operations griffin s consolidated total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million reflects increases in revenue of million at griffin land and million at imperial 
revenue at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  principally reflecting an increase in revenue of million from property sales 
the property sales included million from the sale of griffin land s remaining development rights at its walden woods residential development in windsor  connecticut and two smaller sales of residential land 
there were no property sales in fiscal griffin land s revenue from leasing operations increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as rental revenue from new leases  including two new tenants in the  square foot industrial building that was completed near the end of fiscal and partially leased in  was partially offset by the effect of vacancies in space that was leased in fiscal but was unleased for most or all of fiscal during fiscal  griffin land released  square feet and signed new leases for  square feet and had leases for  square feet which were terminated without a replacement tenant 
at the end of fiscal  griffin land owned  square feet of industrial  flex and office space  with  square feet leased  as compared to  of griffin land s  square feet leased at the end of fiscal the increase in space leased principally reflects the partial leasing of the new building discussed above 
market activity  based on inquiries from potential tenants  in the area where griffin s properties are located increased in as compared to  especially for industrial space 
inquiries by prospective tenants and requests for proposals for both office and industrial space were strong at the end of into early total revenue at imperial increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal unit sales volume in fiscal declined from the unit sales volume in fiscal the effect of the decline in unit sales volume in fiscal was more than offset by increased sales to imperial s garden center customer segment  which generally have higher per unit selling prices than units sold to imperial s other customer segments 
in fiscal  imperial plans to continue to attempt to increase the proportion of product sold to garden centers and reduce  as a percentage of total sales  sales to mass merchants 
griffin incurred a consolidated operating loss of million in fiscal as compared to a consolidated operating loss of million in fiscal the lower operating results reflect decreases of million and million at griffin land and imperial  respectively  and an increase of million in general corporate expense 
operating profit at griffin land decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the following fiscal fiscal amounts in thousands profit from leasing activities before general and administrative expenses and before depreciation and amortization expense   loss on property sales general and administrative expenses   profit before depreciation and amortization expense   depreciation and amortization expense   operating profit  the decrease of million in griffin land s profit from leasing activities before general and administrative expenses and before depreciation and amortization expense principally reflects higher building operating expenses  reflecting higher utility expenses  real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenses  partially offset by lower snow removal expenses 
a portion of the increased operating expenses were not subject to reimbursement from tenants 
griffin land s loss from property sales reflect a profit of million from sales of undeveloped residential land  offset by a loss of million on the sale of the remaining development rights at griffin land s residential development  walden woods  in windsor  connecticut  and the writeoff of million of costs on two potential property sale transactions that did not take place 
the increase of million in general and administrative expenses reflects higher salary and benefit expenses 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense principally reflects depreciation on the new  square foot industrial building completed at the end of fiscal imperial s operating loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as follows fiscal fiscal amounts in thousands net sales and other revenue cost of goods sold   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expenses   operating loss   the million increase in imperial s operating loss was due principally to a million charge for unsaleable inventories in fiscal as compared to a charge of million for unsaleable inventories in fiscal the increased charge for unsaleable inventories in fiscal was principally due to disease and other horticultural issues caused by excessive rainfall in the summer and early fall at imperial s northern florida operation  insufficient sell through on certain inventories  particularly smaller size fast growing products at imperial s connecticut operation  and production plan changes whereby certain young liner plants will not be grown into larger sizes 
inventories of the smaller sized products are planned to be much lower in fiscal than they were in fiscal excluding the additional charges for unsaleable inventories in both years  imperial s gross margins on sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margins  excluding those charges  principally reflected the improved pricing in fiscal that resulted from selling a greater percentage of higher priced plants to garden center customers 
imperial s selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  imperial s selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in both fiscal and fiscal an increase in selling expenses of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mostly offset by lower marketing and general and administrative expenses 
the higher selling expenses reflect higher salesperson compensation expense and higher bad debt expense 
the increase in salesperson compensation expense reflects an increased headcount of salespersons and an increase in commissions due to the improved pricing and higher sales to customer segments that generate higher commissions 
the increase in bad debt expense reflects the chapter filing by frank s nursery crafts  inc frank s  one of imperial s larger customers 
imperial s bad debt expense on the frank s bankruptcy was mitigated by the subsequent sale of its claim  which recovered a significant percentage of the total amount due from frank s at the time it declared bankruptcy 
the lower marketing expenses principally reflects the inclusion in fiscal of expenses related to the introduction of plants to be sold under the new novalis trade name 
the lower general and administrative expenses reflect lower donation and contribution expenses 
griffin s general corporate expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase reflects incentive compensation expense of million in fiscal as compared to no incentive compensation expense in fiscal in addition  general corporate expense increased million for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to griffin s credit agreement  which was terminated in the second quarter  million for capital based state and local taxes and million for costs related to a proposed financing which did not take place 
in fiscal  griffin completed the sale of its investment in centaur to centaur holdings  a newly formed company 
griffin received cash proceeds of million after transaction expenses of million but before income tax payments 
in addition to the cash proceeds  griffin received  shares of common stock of centaur holdings  which was valued at approximately million based on the per share price of the initial public offering of shares by centaur holdings and the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at that time 
griffin was prohibited from selling its centaur holdings common stock for six months from the transaction date 
that restriction lapsed in the fourth quarter 
griffin recorded a pretax gain of million on the sale and a foreign currency exchange gain of million related to the sale 
in connection with the centaur transaction  substantially all of the stock options of centaur were exercised immediately prior to the closing of the centaur transaction  which resulted in griffin s ownership being reduced from to 
the gain of approximately million that resulted from the dilution of griffin s ownership is included in the gain on the sale of that investment 
in addition  griffin recorded other comprehensive income of million at the time of the transaction  reflecting the difference  net of tax  between the value of griffin s investment in centaur holdings and the book value of the pro rata portion of the investment in centaur that remained as a result of receiving the centaur holdings common stock as a part of the sale proceeds 
subsequent to the transaction  griffin recorded an other comprehensive loss of million reflecting changes in the market price of the common stock of centaur holdings and changes in the foreign currency exchange rate 
griffin s consolidated interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal higher interest expense in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter was offset by the lower interest expense in the balance of the year as a result of the paydown of the entire amount outstanding under the credit agreement with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of centaur 
griffin s average outstanding debt in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal griffin had million of interest income  dividend income and gains on short term investments in fiscal from the investment of the remaining proceeds from the sale of centaur  after repaying the credit agreement debt and making estimated income tax payments 
griffin s effective income tax provision rate was for fiscal  as compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in fiscal the effective income tax provision rate principally reflects a rate for federal income taxes adjusted for certain tax credits related to foreign income taxes paid by centaur and a basis difference on that investment 
in addition  the fiscal effective tax rate includes the release of an income tax liability of million upon completion of tax examinations of prior years 
the effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal reflects a rate for federal income taxes adjusted for state income taxes 
griffin s fiscal results include equity income of million through the date of griffin s sale of its investment in centaur  as compared to equity income of million in fiscal griffin s equity income included a charge  of which griffin s allocable share was million  to accrue future costs less expected sublease income for an operating lease of office space that was no longer used by centaur 
excluding the effect of the charge of future lease costs  the lower equity results reflected the sale of griffin s investment early in fiscal as compared to recording equity income for the entire year in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal griffin s total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million reflects increases in total revenue of million at griffin land and million at imperial 
total revenue at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting an increase of million in revenue from griffin land s leasing operations partially offset by not having any property sales in fiscal as compared to revenue of million from property sales in fiscal the increase in revenue from leasing operations was due to a million from the two multi story office buildings that griffin land acquired in the first quarter  b a million increase from new leases of existing space  net of revenue decreases from vacancies  and c million from leasing space that was completed and leased mid year in fiscal but leased for the entire year in fiscal revenue from the early termination of leases was million in both fiscal and fiscal at november   griffin land owned  square feet of office  flex and industrial space for lease  with  leased 
at november   griffin land had  square feet of office  flex and industrial space available for lease of which  square feet was leased 
the increase in the amount of total square feet available for lease reflects the completion in the fiscal fourth quarter of the shell of a  square foot industrial building that was ready for tenant work but not yet leased at the end of fiscal leasing in the industrial  flex and office markets where griffin land s properties are located was slower in fiscal as compared to the previous two years 
inquiries from prospective tenants have increased in the latter part of fiscal and the early part of fiscal as compared to earlier in fiscal  which management believes indicates that leasing activity may strengthen in the second half of fiscal total revenue at imperial increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in imperial s revenue principally reflects a increase in unit sales volume and the effect of selling  on average  larger sized material in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in sales of larger sized plants reflects changes in imperial s product mix made over the past several years 
these were offset by overall lower pricing  as product available from growers appeared to exceed demand 
management believes that net sales in fiscal and fiscal were hampered by unfavorable weather conditions  particularly during imperial s peak spring selling season in both years 
in fiscal  cold weather in march and early april  including snow in some areas  followed by excessive rain in the latter part of spring resulted in customers delaying and  in many cases  canceling orders 
these factors particularly affected imperial s garden center and wholesaler customer segments 
in fiscal  net sales were negatively affected by poor spring weather  which included drought conditions in the mid atlantic area and excessive rain and cold in the midwest 
imperial s spring net sales accounts for approximately of imperial s annual net sales 
griffin s consolidated operating loss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower consolidated operating loss reflects an increase of million in operating profit at griffin land and a decrease of million in the operating loss at imperial  partially offset by an increase of million in griffin s general corporate expense 
operating profit at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the following fiscal fiscal amounts in thousands profit from leasing acitivities before depreciation and amortization expense   profit from property sales general and administrative expenses   profit before depreciation and amortization expense   depreciation and amortization expense   operating profit   griffin land s profit before depreciation and interest from its leasing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due principally to the increase of million in rental revenue discussed above  partially offset by an increase of million in operating expenses of griffin land s buildings 
the higher operating expenses reflect million related to the two office buildings acquired in the first quarter  million from buildings that were online for the entire year in fiscal as compared to part of the year in fiscal and million of higher expenses throughout all buildings  due principally to higher snow removal costs  utility expenses and real estate taxes 
property sales generated a profit of million in fiscal  however there were no property sales in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense at griffin land increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due principally to depreciation on the two office buildings acquired in the fiscal first quarter and a full year s depreciation on buildings completed in fiscal  which included only a partial year s depreciation on those assets 
griffin land s general and administrative expenses  including real estate taxes on undeveloped land  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due principally to real estate tax increases 
imperial s operating loss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as follows fiscal fiscal amounts in thousands net sales and other revenue   cost of goods sold   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expenses   operating loss   the lower operating loss reflects an increase in imperial s gross profit from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher gross profit was due to a lower charge for unsaleable inventories in fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offset by the effect of lower pricing 
in fiscal  cost of goods sold included a million charge for inventory losses above normal amounts as compared to a million charge included in fiscal cost of goods sold 
the inventory charge in fiscal reflected failures in certain crops  poor results from the propagation of new plants at imperial s northern florida operation and failure to sell certain parts of the inventory which subsequently became unsaleable 
the significantly lower inventory charge in fiscal was due to improved operations at imperial s florida facility partially offset by the effect of certain disease issues at imperial s connecticut operations 
excluding the effect of the inventory charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  imperial s gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal imperial s gross margins on sales excluding the effect of the inventory charges in both years decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the lower gross profit and lower margins reflect the effect of the weakened pricing in fiscal and higher fiscal freight costs that could not be passed on to customers  which more than offset the effect of the increase in unit sales volume 
the higher freight costs  due principally to shipments from imperial s northern florida facility  reflect the cost of ensuring that a sufficient quantity of common carrier trucks was available to imperial to meet the demand for deliveries during imperial s peak spring selling season 
management is continuing to seek new vendor relationships to ensure continued availability of trucks in sufficient quantity to meet expected demand and to reduce these costs in the future 
imperial s selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and fiscal  but as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal imperial s marketing expense included in selling  general and administrative expense increased by million in fiscal due principally to promotion of products sold under the new novalis trade name 
overall lower expenses in other areas  due in part to a headcount reduction and efforts to maintain expenses at prior year s level  offset the effect of the higher marketing expenses 
griffin s general corporate expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase principally reflects million due to higher compensation expenses and million of general expense increases 
griffin s consolidated interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase reflects the overall higher amount of borrowings outstanding in fiscal as compared to fiscal griffin s average amount of debt outstanding in fiscal was million as compared to average outstanding debt of million in fiscal the higher amount of outstanding debt in fiscal includes the million nonrecourse mortgage completed in the first quarter to finance the acquisition of the interest in two griffin center office buildings and other borrowings needed to supplement operating cash flow to finance griffin s working capital requirements and real estate development activities 
the effective rate of griffin s income tax benefit in fiscal was as compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in fiscal the effective rate of griffin s income tax benefit in fiscal reflects a rate for a federal income tax benefit  adjusted for state income tax benefits 
based on projected future taxable income from operations  the sale of appreciated assets  tax planning strategies and the future period in which net operating loss carryforwards may be utilized  management believes it is more likely than not that griffin will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets currently reported 
therefore  a valuation allowance is not included in griffin s results for fiscal the high effective income tax benefit rate in fiscal reflects the tax benefit on griffin s pretax loss and the reversal of a liability of million for income taxes as a result of a favorable outcome of tax examinations for earlier years 
the tax examinations were made on tax returns filed by culbro corporation culbro  griffin s parent company prior to the distribution the distribution of griffin common stock to culbro s shareholders in under a tax sharing agreement  the liability for certain income taxes was assumed by griffin from culbro at the time of the distribution 
griffin s equity income from centaur decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower equity income in fiscal reflects several nonrecurring type items included in centaur s results in fiscal these included the gain at centaur from the sale of its lawtel operation  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
partially offsetting the gain on the sale of lawtel was a goodwill impairment charge at centaur  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
griffin s equity income from centaur in fiscal also included the effect of centaur reversing a valuation allowance on certain of its deferred tax assets  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
griffin s fiscal equity income includes the effect of a charge  of which griffin s allocable share is million  for future costs of a lease for office space no longer being used 
griffin s equity income from centaur in fiscal also benefited from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal in accordance with griffin s adoption of sfas no 
excluding the net effect of these fiscal and one time items  griffin s equity income in centaur increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due principally to increased operating profit at centaur 
the increase in net sales at centaur from fiscal to fiscal was offset by higher costs and expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements griffin does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the million increase in cash used in operating activities principally reflects the investment of million of the proceeds from the sale of centaur in short term investments and griffin s income tax payments of million related to the gain on the sale of centaur 
cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal reflects the proceeds of million from the sale of centaur and a related foreign currency exchange contract  and property sale proceeds of million  principally from the walden woods sale 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal reflects million used for the acquisition of a interest in a real estate joint venture that owned two multi story office buildings of approximately  square feet each located in griffin center in windsor  connecticut 
griffin had previously held the remaining interest 
additions to real estate held for lease in fiscal principally reflect the start of construction of a new  square foot industrial building and tenant improvements  related to new leases and to a ten year lease extension with a major tenant in the new england tradeport 
the new lease rates on the extended lease were based in part on the tenant improvement investment  including an interest factor  to provide griffin land an appropriate return over the lease term on its investment of these improvement costs 
additions to property and equipment  principally for imperial  decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the additions in fiscal were generally for the completion of the expansion of imperial s northern florida growing operation that had been ongoing over the prior four years 
additions to property and equipment in fiscal were to construct facilities needed for a portion of the product to be sold under the new novalis trade name  to increase shipping capacity to meet its needs during its peak spring demand period and for general improvements 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash of million provided by financing activities in fiscal the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal reflects the paydown of all of the outstanding amounts under the credit agreement using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of centaur 
fiscal also includes million of proceeds from an additional mortgage on two industrial buildings 
the proceeds were used to finance tenant improvements related to a ten year lease extension by a major tenant in one of those buildings 
the net cash generated from financing activities in fiscal includes the proceeds from a million nonrecourse mortgage placed on the two multi story office buildings of the joint venture acquired in december and borrowings under the credit agreement to finance griffin s operations 
griffin plans to continue to invest in its real estate business 
additional amounts will be required to complete the remainder of the interiors of the shells of an office building and an industrial building that were built on speculation and available for occupancy in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
currently  each building is partially leased 
the buildout of the unleased parts of these buildings will be started when leases are obtained 
griffin land will also continue to invest in infrastructure improvements required for present and future development in its office and industrial parks 
in fiscal  griffin land started construction  on speculation  of the shell of a new approximately  square foot industrial building in the new england tradeport 
the shell of that building is expected to be completed in the spring  and a lease for approximately  square feet in that building was recently signed 
tenant work for that lease will begin in early  with occupancy expected by mid year 
additional tenant work will be started as new leases are completed 
construction of an additional industrial building is expected to be started in fiscal if the current strong expressions of interest by prospective users for griffin land s industrial buildings result in new leases for that space 
management intends to continue to build industrial space on speculation to ensure that space is available for new leases 
also in fiscal  griffin land received approval for its proposed residential development  stratton farms  in suffield  connecticut 
an owner of certain land adjacent to stratton farms has filed an appeal of the approvals issued by the town s land use commissions 
the start of infrastructure work on this project is expected to begin in fiscal revenue from land sales in stratton farms is not expected until the latter part of fiscal griffin land has entered into agreements to sell undeveloped residential land for million and to sell commercial land for million 
the completion of the residential land sale is contingent on the buyer obtaining approvals from the towns land use commissions 
completion of the sale of commercial land is contingent upon griffin land completing some remediation of the soils on the site  which is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal griffin land intends to proceed with residential development plans on other of its lands that are also appropriate for that use 
griffin s payments including principal and interest under contractual obligations as of november  are as follows total due within one year due from years due from years due in more than years in millions mortgages capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other includes million for the purchase of plant materials and supplies and million related to the construction of a new industrial building 
includes griffin s deferred compensation plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities 
as a result of the centaur transaction  griffin repaid the entire amount outstanding under its credit agreement  terminated the credit agreement and currently has cash of million and short term investments of million 
management believes that the significant amount of cash on hand and short term investments will be sufficient to finance the working capital requirements of griffin s businesses and fund continued investment in griffin s real estate assets for the foreseeable future 
griffin land will also continue to seek nonrecourse mortgage placements on selected properties 
griffin also anticipates seeking to purchase either or both other land and buildings with a substantial portion of its cash and short term investment balances 
there are no specific real estate investments contracted for at this time 
such investment may or may not occur based on many factors  including real estate pricing

forward looking information the above information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
although griffin believes that its plans  intentions and expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such plans  intentions or expectations will be achieved  particularly with respect to the improved return on assets of imperial s operations  construction and leasing of additional facilities in the real estate business  approval of proposed residential subdivisions  or completion of property sales currently under contract 
the projected information disclosed herein is based on assumptions and estimates that  while considered reasonable by griffin as of the date hereof  are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of griffin 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
for fixed rate mortgage debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not earnings or cash flows 
griffin does not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt should not have a significant impact on earnings or cash flows until such debt is refinanced  if necessary 
griffin s mortgage interest rates and related principal payment requirements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
griffin did not have any variable rate debt outstanding at november  an increase in interest rates of would have increased griffin s interest expense on the variable rate debt that was outstanding during the year by  griffin is exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on market values of griffin s cash equivalents and short term investments 
these investments generally consist of overnight investments that are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk  and investments with maturities principally less than three months that are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned and cash flow from these investments 
griffin does not currently have any derivative financial instruments in place to manage interest costs  but that does not mean that griffin will not use them as a means to manage interest rate risk in the future 
in connection with the sale of its investment in centaur  griffin entered into a foreign currency exchange forward contract with fleet national bank to hedge griffin s exposure to the short term fluctuation in the foreign currency exchange rate between the time the definitive agreement on the sale of centaur was completed and the closing of the transaction and receipt of the sale proceeds 
griffin fulfilled its obligation under the contract with the proceeds from the sale of centaur 
griffin does not have foreign currency exposure in operations 
griffin does have an investment in a public company  centaur holdings  plc and a private company  linguaphone group ltd  both based in the united kingdom 
the ultimate liquidation of those investments and conversion of proceeds into united states currency is subject to future foreign currency exchange rates
