item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we focus on the investment in and ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
as of february   we had current operating communities  which are the primary contributors to our overall operating performance 
the net operating income of these communities  which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels  and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when pricing is attractive 
this report  including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements that predict or indicate future events or trends and that do not report historical matters 
actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page of this report 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
business description and community information overview we believe that apartment communities present an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist  and where new rental household formations are expected to out pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets  which are located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  pacific northwest  and northern and southern california regions of the united states 
our strategy is to deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer 
a substantial majority of our communities are upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
however  we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
we believe that  over an entire business cycle  lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flow relative to other markets 
however  throughout the business cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in and  particularly in the technology  telecom and financial services sectors 
this resulted in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates and demand 
however  was a year of transition  where the economy showed signs of an early phase recovery  as evidenced by modest job growth and declining unemployment claims 
the improvement in the economic environment has resulted in more stabilized apartment market fundamentals  as reflected in the following operating results achieved within our established community portfolio specifically during the last three months of we achieved both sequential and year over year revenue growth  our second year over year increase since  economic occupancy stabilized and remained at approximately in each of our markets  despite a seasonal decline in leasing  concessions per move in declined both sequentially and on a year over year basis  and we achieved the first sequential increase in average rental rates since based on these results we believe that will be a year of continued growth 
we expect that with continued job growth in our markets  apartment market fundamentals the demand supply balance will continue to improve such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply by a ratio of almost two to one 
the improvement may not be experienced evenly throughout our markets  but is nevertheless expected to result in overall revenue growth for our established community portfolio in in anticipation of continued improvement in apartment fundamentals and stronger apartment demand  we have increased our development and acquisition volume 
during  we increased our level of acquisition activity in preparation of the closing of a discretionary investment fund 
in addition  we continued to secure new development rights  as discussed below  bringing our pipeline for potential development opportunities to a new high 
however  we continued to dispose of communities in in response to opportunities to realize value 
in  we expect to continue acquisitions for the discretionary investment fund  particularly potential redevelopment opportunities  and to continue to be an opportunistic seller  while increasing our development activity over levels 
our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities  and development rights ie  land or land options held for development  as further described in item of this report 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities  for which detailed discussions can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   we owned or held an ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which ten communities were under construction and four communities were under reconstruction 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different estimates or assumptions had been made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
as a reit that owns  operates and develops apartment communities  our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and reit status 
a discussion of all of our accounting policies  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
in accordance with our standard lease terms  rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis 
any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease  which is generally one year 
a discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for established communities can be found in results of operations 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when active development commences until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use  which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating costs incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  deeming future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
we generally capitalize only non recurring expenditures 
we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds  ii extends the useful life of the asset  and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident 
under this policy  virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring  as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred 
recurring make ready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements  ii floor coverings  iii interior painting  and iv other redecorating costs 
because we expense recurring make ready costs such as carpet replacements  our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover 
we capitalize purchases of personal property  such as computers and furniture  only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds  we generally expense replacements of personal property 
in  and  the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions  development and redevelopment were   and  respectively 
for established and other stabilized communities  we recorded non revenue generating capital expenditures of  or per apartment home in   or per apartment home in and  or per apartment home in in addition  revenue generating capital expenditures  such as water submetering equipment and cable installations  were   and  in  and  respectively 
the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home  including carpet and appliance replacements  related to these communities was  in   in and  in historically  we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased  and expensed maintenance costs have fluctuated with turnover 
we expect these trends to continue  with capitalized costs increasing in over prior year levels as we embark on a number of community upgrades and improvements 
asset impairment evaluation if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community  our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of the community 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flow of the community  we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value 
real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell 
we account for our investments in unconsolidated entities that are not variable interest entities in accordance with statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures and accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment  we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value 
a loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a real estate investment trust  or reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions  net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market  disposition and financing activity 
a comparison of our operating results for the years  and follows dollars in thousands change change change change revenue rental and other income management  development and other fees total revenue expenses direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes property taxes total community operating expenses net operating income corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management interest expense depreciation expense general and administrative expense impairment loss total other expenses equity in income of unconsolidated entities  n a interest income venture partner interest in profit sharing minority interest in consolidated partnerships income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate assets total discontinued operations income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income dividends attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders decreased  or  to  in this decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales as a result of reduced disposition activity from the historically high levels experienced in  partially offset by increased net operating income from newly developed and acquired communities 
net income available to common stockholders increased  or to  in this increase is primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities due to increased disposition activity  including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities  and the absence of impairment losses in  partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expense 
net operating income noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level or financing related costs 
noi reflects the operating performance of a community  and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
noi is defined by us as total revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes  and excludes corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses  investments and investment management  interest income and expense  general and administrative expense  impairment losses  equity in income of unconsolidated entities  minority interest in consolidated partnerships  venture partner interest in profit sharing  depreciation expense  gain on sale of real estate assets  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  and income from discontinued operations 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a calculation of noi for  and  along with a reconciliation to net income for each year  is provided in the preceding table 
the noi increase of  in and decrease of  in  as compared to the prior years  consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands increase decrease increase decrease established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities non allocated total for purposes of this table  amounts have been restated from amounts previously reported for changes in discountinued operations as described in note  discountinued operations real estate assets sold or held for sale  of our consolidated financial statements 
the noi decreases in established communities were largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in our markets during and the first half of the impact of historical job losses in many of our markets  in addition to strong single family home sales  aggravated a weak demand environment  which caused market rental rates to decline 
however  was a year of transition  where modest job growth and declining unemployment claims reflected the early stages of an economic recovery 
strengthening apartment fundamentals  along with strong on site execution  resulted in year over year increases in noi during the latter half of  as evidenced in the diminishing decline in noi in as compared to based on economic forecasts that project an acceleration in job growth in our markets in as compared to the modest job growth experienced in  we expect an improved demand supply ratio in our occupancy has reached stabilized levels  and we began to increase rental rates and reduce concessions in the latter half of in  we expect the positive momentum from to continue  resulting in growth in revenue from our established communities of to in as compared to we aggressively manage operating expenses  which we expect to increase by to in  resulting in noi growth for our established community portfolio of to in as compared to rental and other income increased in both and due to rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities  as well as increased occupancy for our established communities  partially offset by declines in effective rental rates for our established communities 
we expect continued improvement in apartment fundamentals due largely to the job growth projected for overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  apartment homes for and  in this change is primarily the result of increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities and an increase in the overall occupancy rate  partially offset by communities sold in and the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  in as compared to  in and  in  primarily due to the poor demand supply fundamentals in our markets that resulted in a high concessionary environment in certain of our markets 
established communities rental revenue decreased  or  in and  or  in these decreases are due to declining rental rates  partially offset by increased economic occupancy as compared to the prior years 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  compared to  in  partially due to the impact of increased concessions granted throughout and into the average economic occupancy increased from in to in economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we expect rental revenue from established communities to increase to in as compared to although rental revenue from the established community portfolio as a whole was relatively flat in as compared to  we had increases in established communities rental revenue in four of our six regions 
the largest increase was in the mid atlantic with an increase in rental revenue of between years  reflecting an increase in both economic occupancy and average rental rates 
in addition  in southern california  we were able to increase average rental rates by  while also increasing economic occupancy by  resulting in an increase in rental revenue of between years 
the midwest and pacific northwest experienced increases in rental revenue of and  respectively  during as compared to  reflecting increased economic occupancy partially offset by declining average rental rates 
however  our total rental revenue from established communities was impacted by the continued declines in average rental rates in certain northern california and northeast markets 
northern california  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced a decline in rental revenue of in as compared to  partially related to the continued impact of job losses experienced in the technology sector in prior years 
although economic occupancy in northern california increased to an average of in  average rental rates dropped to  from  during however  we began to see signs of improvement in northern california during the last three months of  as average rental rates and economic occupancy both increased sequentially 
therefore  we expect year over year revenue growth in northern california in the northeast region accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue during rental revenue remained relatively flat as compared to  as the region entered the early stages of economic recovery from the job losses experienced in the financial services sector in prior years 
economic occupancy increased by during  while average rental rates dropped to  from  in the northeast region appears to be stabilizing  as reflected in year over year rental revenue growth during the latter half of although we expect pressure on rental rates to continue in the northeast region  we expect year over year revenue growth in the northeast in  but at a lesser pace than other regions 
in accordance with gaap  cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term  which is generally one year 
as a supplemental measure  we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 
rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions  as well as current rental market conditions 
the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
information for the year ended december  is not presented  as established community classification is not applicable prior to january  see note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended rental revenue gaap basis concessions amortized concessions granted rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis year over year change gaap revenue n a year over year change cash concession based revenue n a concessions granted per move in for established communities averaged during  an increase of from in concessions granted per move in peaked at  during the three months ended june   before subsiding to during the three months ended december  the decrease in recent months is expected to continue into as demand supply fundamentals improve with job growth and we regain pricing power 
however  because we amortize concessions over the lease term  the historically high concessions from will continue to lower reported operating results in management  development and other fees decreased in both and as compared to prior years due to a decrease in the number of communities that we manage 
in addition  in we recognized  in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest 
in  we expect management  development and other fees to increase as we begin to earn asset and property management fees from the discretionary investment fund discussed elsewhere in this report 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased in both and due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes  coupled with increased expenses due to salary increases and leasing bonuses  as well as increased make ready costs associated with increasing occupancy 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  or  to  in due primarily to increased salaries and leasing bonuses  as well as increased make ready costs associated with increasing occupancy as discussed above 
during  operating expenses increased  or  due primarily to inclement weather  increased insurance costs and bad debt expenses 
we expect expense growth in to be consistent with growth levels in with pressure on salaries and utilities  partially offset by moderation in bad debt expenses  marketing costs and insurance 
property taxes increased in both and as compared to prior years due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes  partially offset by property tax refunds 
for established communities  property taxes increased in and by  and  respectively  as compared to the prior year  due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions  partially offset by successful tax appeals 
we expect property taxes to increase in as local jurisdictions are expected to continue to seek additional revenue sources to offset budget deficits 
we manage property tax increases internally  as well as engage third party consultants  and appeal increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in due to increased compensation costs 
during  corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased due to associate separation costs  as well as increased corporate level marketing and customer service costs to respond to pressure on economic occupancy 
investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions  investment management and abandoned pursuit costs  which include the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits  acquisition pursuits and technology investments 
investments and investment management increased in as compared to due to costs incurred in forming a potential discretionary investment fund  increased compensation costs and increased abandoned pursuit costs 
investments and investment management decreased in as compared to due to decreases in abandoned pursuit costs 
abandoned pursuit costs were   and  in  and  respectively 
abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile  and the activity experienced in any given year may not be experienced in future years 
we expect investments and investment management costs to continue to increase in due to the costs associated with operating and managing the investment fund 
interest expense decreased in as compared to primarily due to the repayment of unsecured debt and reissuance at lower interest rates  overall lower interest rates and lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility 
interest expense increased in as compared to  primarily due to the issuance in late of unsecured notes and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility  partially offset by the repayment of certain unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both short term and long term borrowings 
we expect interest expense to increase in as interest rates rise and we increase our leverage from current levels 
depreciation expense increased in both and primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities  as well as the acquisition of new communities in and general and administrative expense g a increased in as a result of higher compensation expense  increased litigation and settlement costs associated with certain community and corporate matters and additional corporate governance costs  including costs relating to compliance with sarbanes oxley 
g a increased in as a result of construction litigation relating to a community that has completed development and increased directors and officers d o insurance  which was renewed in march we expect g a to continue to increase in due to increased corporate governance primarily sarbanes oxley compliance and compensation costs  but at a reduced pace as compared to impairment loss of  was recorded during related to two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition 
no impairment losses were recorded in either or equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased in and increased in primarily due to our share of the gain received on a community sold in which was accounted for under the equity method in which we held a interest 
interest income decreased in and as compared to prior years due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates 
in addition  effective january   we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note due to the implementation of fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and interpretation of arb no 
 as revised in december therefore  interest income that we recognized in and is not reflected in as such amounts were eliminated in consolidation 
see note  organization and significant accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements 
on october   we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity 
the mortgage note was repaid prior to its scheduled maturity  and therefore the total proceeds of  included an early prepayment premium of approximately  net of related legal costs along with the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest 
upon repayment of the mortgage note  our economic interest in this entity ended  and therefore this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under fin and we discontinued consolidation 
venture partner interest in profit sharing represents the income allocated to our venture partner in a profit sharing arrangement as discussed in note  investments in unconsolidated entities  of our consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations as compared to prior years are due to changes in the net income of the underlying real estate 
effective december   we no longer account for our interest in this venture as a profit sharing arrangement 
minority interest in consolidated partnerships decreased in due to the consolidation of an entity under fin  as discussed above 
we do not hold an equity interest in this entity  and therefore of the entity s net income or loss is recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships 
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from january  through december  the decreases in and are due to the timing of the sale of five communities in and eleven communities in gain on sale of communities decreased in and increased in due to the volume of disposition activity in each year 
the amount of gains realized depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 
we expect to continue to sell communities based on overall portfolio allocation needs as well as to respond to opportunities in the market to maximize risk adjusted returns 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in is a result of the implementation of fin  discussed above  and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under fin and the previously recorded net assets 
dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased during and primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during and funds from operations ffo is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo  see selected financial data  included in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing  source and amount of cash flow provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  particularly to changes in interest rates 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flow from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service and maturity payments  preferred stock dividends and downreit partnership unit distributions  the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  and opportunities for the acquisition of improved property 
we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   a decrease of  from  on december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in from  in  primarily due to additional noi from recently acquired and developed communities  partially offset by the loss of noi from the communities sold in and  as discussed earlier in this report 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through development  redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities  partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and the receipt of payment on a participating mortgage note 
during  we invested  in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures we began the development of six new communities 
these communities  if developed as expected  will contain a total of  apartment homes  and the total capitalized cost  including land acquisition costs  is projected to be approximately  we completed the development of seven communities containing a total of  apartment homes for a total capitalized cost  including land acquisition cost  of  we began the redevelopment of three communities  two of which were acquired prior to  and one of which was acquired in as discussed below with the intent of being owned by a discretionary investment fund 
these communities contain apartment homes and  if redeveloped as expected  will be completed for a total capitalized cost of  of which  was incurred prior to redevelopment 
we completed the redevelopment of one community containing apartment homes for a total capitalized cost of  of which  was incurred prior to redevelopment 
we acquired five communities containing a total of  apartment homes for an aggregate purchase price of  which included the assumption of  of fixed rate mortgage debt 
four of these communities were acquired with the intent of being owned by a discretionary investment fund 
we acquired ten parcels of land  including three parcels of improved land  in connection with development rights  for an aggregate purchase price of  we had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of  and non real estate capital expenditures of financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled  in  consisting primarily of dividends paid and certain debt repayments  partially offset by a decrease in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility  issuance of mortgage notes payable  issuance of common stock for option exercises and issuance of unsecured notes 
see note  notes payable  unsecured notes and credit facility  and note  stockholders equity  of our consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
variable rate unsecured credit facility we have a  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and wachovia bank  na serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial banks 
under the terms of the credit facility  if we elect to increase the facility by up to an additional  and one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment  then we will be able to increase the facility up to  and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase  such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds 
we pay participating banks  in the aggregate  an annual facility fee of approximately  in quarterly installments 
the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on february  
the spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based upon the rating of our long term unsecured debt 
in addition  a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
we had  outstanding under this competitive bid option at february  priced at libor plus  or 
we are subject to i certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility  including  but not limited to  maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios  a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels  and ii prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed of our ffo  except as may be required to maintain our reit status 
the credit facility matures in may  assuming our exercise of a one year renewal option 
at february    was outstanding   was used to provide letters of credit and  was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 
future financing and capital needs debt maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory

financed by variable rate  tax exempt debt  that was effectively fixed through a swap agreement at december  and was reported as fixed rate debt at that time 
the debt was restructured in february such that the interest rate was capped through an interest rate protection agreement and is currently included as variable rate debt for financial reporting purposes

variable rate construction loan was refinanced in march  extending the maturity date to april this community was deconsolidated as of december  see note  investments in unconsolidated real estate entities  of our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the deconsolidation and the note balance as of december  future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as of december   we had ten new communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we had four communities under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction  as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights  will be funded from the remaining capacity under our current  unsecured credit facility  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  retained operating cash  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or private equity funding 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to a discretionary investment fund discussed below  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
we have engaged in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities 
this fund would serve  for a period of three years from its initial closing date or until of its committed capital is invested  as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities  subject to certain exceptions 
these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions  properties acquired in tax deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund  if any 
the fund would not restrict our development activities  and would terminate after a term of eight years  subject to two one year extensions 
as of february   we have acquired four communities with the intent of being owned by the fund  but which are currently consolidated and included in our operating results 
we are currently targeting acquisitions for the fund where value creation opportunities are present through one or more of the following redevelopment activities  market cycle opportunities or improved property operations 
we expect the fund to have equity commitments of up to  and the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to on a portfolio basis  which would enable the fund to invest up to  we would contribute of the total equity up to  we expect closing on the equity funding during the first quarter of there can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or  if formed  what its size  terms or investment performance will be 
we have also recently increased our use of joint ventures to hold individual real estate assets  pursuant to which certain developments will be held upon completion through partnership vehicles 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to enter into joint ventures in the future  or that  if we do  we will achieve our objectives 
the following joint venture activity occurred during we entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated third party for the development of avalon chrystie place i 
we hold a equity interest in this joint venture entity with a right to of distributions after achievement of a threshold return  with the remaining equity interest held by the third party  we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party which provides that  after we complete construction of avalon del rey  the community will be owned and operated by a joint venture between us and the third party 
upon construction completion  the third party venture partner will invest  and will be granted a ownership interest in the venture  while we retain a equity interest  we entered into an agreement to develop avalon at juanita village through a wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary and  upon construction completion  contribute the community to a joint venture 
upon contribution of the community to the joint venture  we expect to be reimbursed for all costs incurred to develop the community 
the third party joint venture partner will receive a equity interest in the joint venture and will manage the joint venture 
we will receive a residual profits interest and will be engaged to manage the community for a property management fee  and we entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated third party for the development of avalon at mission bay north ii  which is expected to begin construction in early we hold a equity interest in this joint venture entity  with the remaining equity interest held by the third party 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we often sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
in response to real estate and capital markets conditions  including strong institutional demand for product in our markets  we sold five communities in  and anticipate selling additional communities when opportunities arise for harvesting value in however  we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses  noi and ffo 
as of february   we have two communities classified as held for sale under gaap 
we are actively pursuing the disposition of these communities and expect to close on these dispositions in however  we cannot assure you that these communities will be sold as planned 
off balance sheet arrangements we own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities  with ownership interests up to 
three of these unconsolidated real estate entities  avalon terrace  llc  cvp i  llc and avalonbay redevelopment  llc have debt outstanding as of december  avalon terrace  llc has  of variable rate debt which matures in november and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate 
cvp i  llc has a  construction loan which matures in february  assuming exercise of two one year renewal options  and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity 
avalonbay redevelopment  llc has  of variable rate debt which matures in april and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate 
we have not guaranteed the debt on avalon terrace  llc and avalonbay redevelopment  llc  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so 
however  in connection with the general contractor services that we provide to cvp i  llc  the entity that owns and is developing avalon chrystie place i  we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the construction financing 
our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion once all of the lender s standard completion requirements have been satisfied 
we currently expect this to occur in there are no lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities 
in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage  management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 
for more information regarding the operations of our unconsolidated entities see note  investments in unconsolidated real estate entities  of our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space 
scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes  outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of december  the table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in see liquidity and capital resources 
inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in an inflationary environment  this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness 
under swap agreements we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment  and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt 
furthermore  a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately  of unconsolidated variable rate debt existed as of december  the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate  tax exempt debt was not electively entered into by us but  rather  was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our tax exempt bond financings 
because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
had these swap agreements not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively  based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years 
however  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher throughout and and these swap agreements had not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  fixed rate debt represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by
